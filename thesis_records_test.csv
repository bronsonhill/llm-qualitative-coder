Disclaimer: we are currently short JinkoSolar shares and the below represents our opinion.
SECTION I - INTRODUCTION
JinkoSolar (“JKS”, “Jinko”) operates in a fragmented, commoditized, hyper-competitive and deflationary industry—solar module manufacturing. Following a ~250% runup in the stock since June, we believe Jinko represents a highly attractive short opportunity with >70% near-term downside in a base case and more in a bear case scenario. Our view is based on several factors:
The spike in the shares appears to be tied to three things: (1) the view that the global demand picture is improving and the currently elevated margins can remain so for longer, (2) the widespread belief that a Biden victory in the presidential election represents a significant source of earnings upside for the company, and (3) the company plans to list a subsidiary in China’s A-share market, where solar stocks currently trade at a higher average multiple of earnings, and some investors have speculated that the proceeds of the Shanghai equity issuance will be used to buy back the NYSE-listed ADRs at a large premium. We believe bullish investors are incorrect on all three accounts: 
(1) We believe that Jinko is over-earning due to short-term mismatch between spot market trends and the company’s reported results. This dynamic is clearly evident when comparing 3Q and 4Q guidance to close competitors, yet the market has extrapolated a very temporary trend. Jinko earnings quality is poor in our view and unlikely to improve. Due to the limited disclosure the company provides, we believe that investors are unduly reliant on the company’s reported adjusted metrics, which are not telling the full story. Industry fundamentals are actively rolling over, and we consider the company’s position in the market mediocre. There is significant low-cost supply entering a market where Jinko’s gross margins still quite elevated relative to recent levels, and a normalization in earnings is already underway.
(2) If Biden is elected, his plan would likely boost solar demand in the US over the next 5 years, but Biden’s election is actually more of a negative than positive for Jinko. The extension of the current investor tax credit will result in a rapid deployment of modules currently held in inventory by developers, reducing 2021 import demand. As the section 201 and potentially 301 tariffs on solar modules are more likely to be removed under Biden, there is a high probability of over a thousand basis points of estimated margin compression in Jinko’s most lucrative market.
(3) In discussions with investors, Jinko management has made it clear that proceeds from A-share equity issuance cannot be used to retire ADRs. Valuation gaps between dual-listed H-shares and A-shares can be arbitrarily and sustainably high due to the closed nature of the mainland Chinese exchanges.  There is no mechanism for value convergence between the two securities.
Our research on the business suggests significant downside earnings variance relative to consensus, driven by pricing and margin compression. We expect 2021 EBITDA of $328mm vs. consensus $458mm, which at 7x EBITDA results in 77% downside from current.

SECTION II – SUPPLY-DEMAND AND NEAR-TERM EARNINGS
We believe the market is extrapolating strong earnings growth into the future based on Jinko’s 2Q results, which in our view were characterized by poor earnings quality, and 3Q guidance, which benefitted from a nonrecurring timing effect. We estimate the global solar module market became oversupplied in 2Q20 and will be at least 85GW, or 54%, oversupplied in 2021.

Below we simply adjust the Bloomberg list for where it is lower than more recent company disclosure and update based on known capacity additions in 2021. We forecast over 200GW of tier one supply today across 40 manufacturers and 142GW today across the top ten, which will be 241GW and 179GW, respectively, in 2021:
PV Module Manufacturers Meeting BNEF’s Tier 1 Criteria, Today vs. 2021:
  Source: BNEF, our analysis
This estimate is the lower bound since many other module players are adding capacity as well, and it already represents 85GW of excess supply vs. BNEF midpoint 2021 demand estimate of 156GW. Said another way, the excess supply projected in 2021 from the list above is greater than the entire global demand for solar in any year before 2017. We believe that the industry really entered oversupply in 2Q20, but the choppiness from the pandemic has obscured industry fundamentals, causing margin weakness to be blamed on demand, not supply.
Wafers
Wafers are an intermediate step in the value chain between solar-grade polysilicon (“poly”) and finished solar modules. We believe that the wafer business is the hidden driver of margin for the vertically integrated manufacturers like Jinko. According to Longi’s discussions with investors since 2Q, a large amount of new wafer capacity is coming online before the end of 2020, driving an estimated 500bp Q-o-Q gross margin compression in this product for the low-cost leader.
Below is a mono wafer supply projection, which we believe is conservative. Key rival Longi should easily have over 50% market share in 2020 and 2021 (relative to demand, not total capacity). Longi and Zhonghuan alone will likely have sufficient capacity to meet global demand.

Wafers impact on modules
Below is a graph estimating, based on sporadic company disclosure, Jinko’s clean gross margins vs. the percentage of their total wafer capacity that is monocrystalline (3Q20 midpoint of guidance included). During the period depicted, the industry underwent a rapid shift from the legacy multicrystalline wafer technology to monocrystalline, and Jinko was able to ride that temporary changeover in supply to several hundred basis points of margin expansion. 1Q20 was the peak, following which a wave of new capacity from Longi, Zhonghuan and Jinko entered in 2Q.
Source: company filings and quarterly conference calls
According to BNEF’s illustrative build for a vertically integrated mono module manufacturer based on 2Q spot prices, a manufacturer could earn a 14% margin selling mono wafers externally on the open market, while only a 12.9% margin selling mono modules on the open market. This table is evidence that a normalization in wafer margins should drive a normalization in module margins, something that has not received much attention in the sellside’s analysis of Jinko’s business. Jinko does not sell many wafers externally and thus investors cannot see the internal mechanics of their margin structure.

Source: BNEF, our analysis
If the above analysis is rolled out to 4Q20 to adjust for Longi’s anticipated -500bps of gross margin pressure in wafers and the elevated poly price running through the chain, then module margins even passing through the entirety of the poly inflation will be down almost 150bps. This compares to company guidance of “slightly down”.
BNEF Vertically Integrated Mono Module Economics, 4Q20E Estimate
Source: BNEF, our analysis
In summary, we believe Jinko is facing a steeply oversupplied market for modules and wafers, the bulk of incremental capacity is being added by low cost players (Longi, Canadian, Zhonghuan, and others), and the hidden driver of the company’s dramatic margin expansion is reversing before the end of the year. Investors should not underestimate the magnitude that these margins can give up in a short period of time – the last solar cycle in 2017 saw Jinko’s gross margins fall from 22.1% in 3Q16 to 10.5% just 3 quarters later, and that was during a period in which global demand continuously grew.
Near-term earnings trajectory—what is around the corner?
2Q – In the second quarter of 2020, JKS surprised on shipments (+2.7% beat vs. guide), selling prices (+2.1% vs. guide), and gross margins (+90bps vs. guide). Keep in mind they guided on June 15th, so probably had decent visibility into the quarter’s results at the time, but the reported numbers were remarkably resilient. Jinko grew shipments 31% Q-o-Q, and only suffered 11% Q-o-Q ASP decline and 160bps Q-o-Q GM compression, despite a mix-shift towards China in a quarter where macroeconomic uncertainties were at a peak and there were reports of widespread cancellations and order deferrals.
Source: Energytrend, company quarterly earnings release
Source: company filings
We believe two factors drove better 2Q performance compared to expectations. First, Jinko has an order book which secured some volumes at prices above the collapsing market price—there is evidence of their order book based on this snippet from the 2019 20-F: “Pursuant to our order book of 2020, we are well positioned with 55% of expected solar module shipments for full year 2020 secured as of March 31, 2020, compared to 65% of total solar module shipments for full year 2019 secured as of March 31, 2019.” Management has shared that purchase orders frequently include a down payment, and typically the contract has a force majeure clause. In the second quarter, Jinko experienced an impact in residential, but the utilities were not cancelling or delaying orders. While no doubt some resi customers (only 10% of the total US volumes) were able to move out shipments or get them cancelled completely, it seems safe to assume that most contracts were fulfilled as written given the high order book coverage as of 3/31. Note that with 25% of the year already gone, Jinko’s 55% coverage rate implies a weighted average contract duration of just over 3 months. This 3-month lag would have the effect of dampening the 2Q ASP decline, although orders written subsequent to March will weigh on achieved prices in the second half of 2020.
The second factor is the mix-shift to China in the quarter. Roughly 8-10GW of projects missed the 2019 commissioning deadline (12/31), and had until 6/30/20 to commission and receive a slightly diminished feed-in tariff. We believe that Jinko quickly diverted volumes into China, which would have been dilutive to GM but allowed the company to outperform their shipment guidance. The negative GM impact may have been somewhat offset by the contract mix effect described above. We believe that the last-minute sales rush in China is the reason for the large net working capital headwind in 2Q, where Jinko burned $100mm of CFFO despite reporting $119mm of EBITDA. Accounts receivables alone caused ~$70mm of cash flow headwind, which could be due to Jinko rushing volumes out the door right before the quarter ended and before the cash could be collected. Chinese customers are known to have considerably longer accounts receivable turns because they buy on credit and depend on the frequently delayed government subsidy program for cash to repay the equipment manufacturers, whereas western customers pay upfront deposits which negates the working capital use of cash.
3Q – moving to 3Q, the higher-priced contracts would be expected to roll off, causing Jinko to experience significant sequential pricing and gross margin pressure, with the potential for some cost pressure as the upstream polysilicon disruptions work through the P&L. 
Instead, while the midpoint pricing guidance was considerably weaker than expected at -9% Q-o-Q (confirming our suspicions about the contract lag), the margin guidance was flat Q-o-Q as unit costs were guided down 9% as well. This is difficult to fathom in a quarter where spot poly prices rose ~40% Q-o-Q, and closed the quarter a whopping 83% above the average level in June, not to mention other important inputs like silver paste were up ~45%. 
The company’s explanation is that they will not see the impact of higher input prices until September and the brunt of the impact will fall in 4Q. Management also shared that they did not sign many contracts in China in 2Q (when the market price was at trough) so they are benefitting from higher average pricing in 3Q. In other words, Jinko is expensing the last of its lower-cost polysilicon inventory in 3Q, depressing its manufacturing costs, while benefitting from the sequentially higher prevailing market prices in 3Q (up to +$0.02/W). This mismatch (prices that are passing through a cost not yet incurred) is purely a GAAP phenomenon, since Jinko’s cash outlay on poly will have stepped up already. This is also confirmed by management, who said that the net working capital headwind would persist (our expectation is that the headwind will be from inventories in 3Q vs. A/R/advances in 2Q). 
Source: company quarterly earnings calls
We believe investors less focused on the details of the earnings trajectory have extrapolated the headline guidance forward into 2021, whereas a deeper look reveals earnings quality concerns and timing-related effects. The underlying picture is quite challenging for Jinko and the broader industry, as early as 4Q20:
  4Q – We believe 4Q gross margins will be disappointing. There are a number of factors in our view combining against Jinko: 
(1) new wafer and module capacity will have been added, estimated above to be a 140bp headwind based on our analysis above
(2) the higher poly prices will finally show up on the P&L, which could be >100bps of headwind based on CSIQ commentary. This is straight from the CSIQ 2Q transcript: “So altogether, I think when it comes to modules, the impact is like $0.02/W. And so, however, in Q3, for pricing, for module price up, we try to reach price for module, but does not mean we can reach 100%. So I would say, we still lost at least 5% margin. That's probably the rough number.”
(3) the USD has weakened against the RMB to become a significant headwind, which we believe implies 80bps of headwind Q-o-Q at spot assuming 50% hedging:
Estimated Impact of FX on 4Q20 Gross Margin
  Source: our analysis
(4) the mix of China installs (which is lower-margin) will be much higher, which is the typical seasonality and has driven an average 4Q GM decline of -270bps since 2015, and 
(5) there is simply no credible reason why Jinko should not experience the same margin headwinds that peers are experiencing already, even if there is a temporary mismatch in 3Q. 
On the 2Q call, an analyst asked whether a 15% GM was likely in 4Q, which would be -300bps vs. 3Q midpoint of guidance. Management said that was too conservative and the margin would be “slightly down.” Our work laid out above would suggest something on the order of 300bps is more than likely even if operating leverage from greater production volumes provides a partial offset. One or two of the points above could be wrong and there is still sufficient headwind to drive a material stepdown in 4Q margins, which we believe should persist into 2021.
To sum up, here is our best estimate for the key moving parts quarter by quarter:

SECTION III – BLUE WAVE IMPACT ON JKS BUSINESS
Investors mistakenly believe that a democratic sweep of the Senate and Presidency is a material positive for JinkoSolar, when in reality there are likely significant headwinds to near-term volumes and margins if the blue wave outcome occurs.
Biden – renewables policy and implications for Jinko?
It would unrealistic to assume that some amount of the recent JKS enthusiasm is not coming from US investors handicapping ever greater odds of a Biden victory and a large democratic Senate majority next month. US-listed solar supply chain stocks, which usually trade with a high beta to the market, have recently outperformed even on days when the market is down big. So what are the likely policy changes that would benefit Jinko? The main one being openly speculated about is an extension of the ITC for solar at 30% for another five years (or longer), with an added inclusion for battery storage. There is also likely a clean energy standard, which would require utilities to reduce carbon generation annually. BNEF anticipates that even in a blue wave outcome, they do not expect a major policy change to impact 2021 demand, but it would be a significant (though hard to quantify) boon for development in 2022 and beyond. In any case, the key form of benefit for Jinko and the other manufacturers would be incremental volumetric demand.
There is logical speculation that Biden would eliminate the section 201 tariffs Trump implemented in 2018, which were ostensibly put in place to stimulate local production of solar cells and modules, but caused US solar prices to approach double the levels seen anywhere else in the world and mainly benefitted FSLR, the only domestic manufacturer of note. The tariffs are structured to step down 5% a year over four years. They began at 30% in February 2018 and so they are currently 20%, stepping down to 15% in 2021 and 0% in 2022. If Biden so chose, he could decrease module costs 15% in a day with the stroke of a pen. There is an added wrinkle in the 201 tariff allowing bifacial panels to be imported with no tariff at all, so the US market has shifted towards this technology for projects where it is practical (ground-mounted utility-scale projects, mostly), but the remainder of the market continues to import monofacial modules at a 20% rate. It is worth bearing in mind that Jinko has 400MW of capacity in Jacksonville, FL, so they would be harmed by the removal of these trade barriers. BNEF estimates there is a huge surplus of capacity that can serve the US demand at an all-in cost below $0.30/W (current spot price is mid to high $0.30s/W). JKS SEA capacity would be in the volume listed between FSLR and the Hanwha/Jinko US capacity below:

Source: BNEF
PV Installation in the U.S. by Applications and by Module Type, 2020
Source: BNEF
The other tariffs in force today are the section 301 tariffs against Chinese imports, a flat 25% on a range of goods originating in China. Jinko has gotten around this by shipping wafers to their cell and module manufacturing facilities in Malaysia, which had 3GW of capacity at the beginning of the year. So the current capacity capable of serving the US market is 3.4GW, 400MW of which is completely tariff-free and 3GW of which is paying only the 20% section 201 tariff on monofacial shipments. We believe the removal of the 301 tariffs, in the case of a Biden rapprochement with China, would be a complete disaster for Jinko since the price would rapidly normalize to the global average and the most lucrative market in the world would cease to be so.
One final point on the implications of a Biden victory. The US market has been massively prebuying modules in conjunction with the stepdown in the solar investor tax credit (“ITC”). BNEF tracked 21GW of imports into the US in 2019, compared to only 11GW of installations, meaning some large number (~9GW) is sitting in inventory and will reduce future procurement of modules in the 2021 timeframe and beyond:
Imports and Installations of Solar Modules to the U.S., 2019-2020
Source: BNEF
The extension of the ITC for five+ more years would have the side-effect of rendering that 9GW almost worthless, since these are now obsolescent modules which would need to be installed immediately, reducing Jinko’s apparent demand in 2021 by almost half.
So the Biden win is likely good for solar shipments over the next five years, but we believe it is a significant negative for module shipments in 2021 and a significant negative for module margins in the scenario where tariffs are removed. It actually seems to be a worse outcome for Jinko’s earnings than a Trump win, since Trump would be more likely to sustain the trade barriers that have hitherto allowed Jinko over-earn in the US market.
SECTION IV – CHINA SUBSIDIARY LISTING PLANS
Jinko’s ADRs are unlikely to converge up to today’s prevailing mainland China valuations, whether or not the company is successful in its announced subsidiary listing plans. The IPO proceeds will not be used for buying back ADRs.
There are two variants of the bull argument we have heard regarding the above corporate initiative to access China’s capital markets. The first is purely around cost of capital, while the second is more about closing the valuation gap between the US and China. 
Jinko’s plans to list in China dramatically reduce the company’s cost of capital such that the through-the-cycle ROIC (~6%) is now sufficient to create value through the cycle
This is part of the stated rationale for the listing and if investors think back, was also the reason Jinko listed on the NYSE in the first place way back in 2010, as they sought to ride the hype of a prior solar cycle into a premium equity valuation courtesy of US capital markets—which then derated the stock to the discounted levels at which Jinko has traded ever since. Leaving aside for the moment the likelihood of such a derating occurring in the A-share market (probably the most volatile equity market in the world) at some point in the future, or the execution risk inherent in effecting a quasi-dual-listing NYSE/SHSE structure that has never been attempted, the bare premise of the listing makes sense. The size of a potential A-share IPO is unknown today, but assuming something like a $1bn / RMB 6.8bn offering, it does not seem to produce a WACC that would create a lot of value over time (it is still only approximately equal to through-the-cycle ROIC), although perhaps they could continuously issue equity in China until a better result was achieved, if the market would bear it.
Hypothetical Pro Forma JKS Cost of Capital
  Source: our analysis
So even in hypothetical scenario where the Shanghai listing goes off without a hitch, the recent dramatic jump in the ADRs does not seem merited if this is purely about cost of capital, since the company is going from an abysmal profile to a merely neutral one.
The relisting will result in Jinko’s ADRs either rising to the level of prevailing clean tech valuations in the A-share market or being taken out at a significant premium
A rumor was circulated in August that Jinko was seeking investors to take the company private before re-listing on one of China’s mainland exchanges – a strategy similar to what Trina and JA Solar have done. Instead of taking this route, however, the company has followed Canadian Solar’s subsidiary listing strategy, the first of its kind to be attempted, as far as we know. More clarity from both Jinko and Canadian on the background of these processes, the level of prior engagement with local regulators, and the different regulatory hurdles to be cleared would certainly be appreciated.. More Importantly, Jinko management has shared with investors that they cannot retire the ADRs with the proceeds from the Shanghai listing, so the rumored take-private/buyout appears to be out of the question.
As far as a market-driven convergence between ADR and A-share valuations, the markets for the dual-listed equities appears to be completely disconnected.  The domestic holders are largely unable to buy the international listing, and international investors are unable to short the A-shares, so the typical free market price arbitrage mechanism is not able to fully function.. This is from a UBS note regarding valuation gaps between the A-share and international markets:
“Fungibility – dual listed shares being fungible tend to bring both lines to near parity…[it should be pointed out that JKS ADRs are not fungible with the Shanghai-listed security]
Accessibility – for developed markets, the ability for investors to have access in trading both lines of shares will ultimately bring both lines close to parity.  In China, international investors (who I view as more fundamental in nature) can only access A-shrs via QFII and StockConnect, so it is relatively restrictive 
Investor mix - foreign investors can only access Chinese A-shares via StockConnect or QFII.  They currently own ~7.3% of freefloat of A-shrs at the moment.  That leaves the rest being owned by local pensions, asset managers and retail.  The multiples local investors pay may be very different than how international investors may pay for the same company.  Generally, A-shr investors are happy to pay higher multiples for stocks with relevant thematics and growth.”
Below is a chart showing the volatile, seemingly random relationship between the Hong Kong and mainland China share prices of dual-listed stocks (red-brown line below). The disconnect has persisted for years and is currently testing all-time high spreads.
A-H Premium for Dual-Listed Equities
Source: UBS
In our experience with another dual-listed stock, investors were actually shorting the international listing initially and buying the A-share, despite the A-share trading at nearly double the level of the international shares, perhaps as a way of hedging out everything but the technicals and momentum of the Shanghai STAR exchange, or as a natural consequence of international short-biased investors having only the H-share borrow available. While it is unclear whether this will happen with Jinko, at the very least investors should not expect a convergence in premium/discount between the two securities to occur organically.
SECTION V – FORWARD EARNINGS AND RISK-REWARD
To summarize the discussion above – 2Q reported and 3Q expected earnings trends convey in our view a misleading picture of the resiliency of a company that is, at the end of the day, a commodity manufacturer in an oversupplied market. We believe positive investor sentiment around a change in US renewables policy is overblown to say the least, and the logic of a massive upward convergence in the value of the ADRs to mainland China trading ranges is flawed. We conclude below with a view on 2021 earnings and our target valuation for JinkoSolar’s ADR.
  2021
The company raised year-end 2020 projected module capacity to 30GW and said something in that range is a fair assumption for 2021 shipments, which is +58% vs. 2020 midpoint. This is a big number, but volume growth is ultimately dictated by demand, and a bigger driver of the economics in 2021 is the magnitude of pricing declines. Over the last four quarters, Jinko’s reported Y-o-Y ASP decline has averaged just -3%, compared to the Energytrend average ASP decline for mono modules over the same period of -22%.
Some of the outperformance has been regional mix (we estimate +630bps in 2019 and +130bps in 2020E), due to Jinko’s rapid growth in the premium-priced US market. But as discussed above, we believe this will reverse in 2021, and -300bps seems like a conservative base case (assumes they add 1GW of US supply in 2021 into a market that is already heavily oversupplied). This regional mix assumption does not include tariff elimination, so there is some more downside relative to spot if that is the ultimate result, and it does not include Japan falling apart (BNEF projects double-digit average declines over the next two years, in a market that is possibly even more lucrative than the US).
Some of the recent pricing outperformance appears to be product mix, as Jinko has been in the top handful of players spearheading a drive towards larger-size wafers today, and in 2019/early 2020 was benefitting from the rapid shift in industry demand to monocrystalline wafers, where the company was concentrating its investments. Both of these are ultimately a commodity as much as anything else, and investors should not expect this to insulate them from pricing pressure in 2021. In fact, since all of the capacity being added is targeting the newer, faster-growing products, these are likelier to experience more near-term overbuilding and deflation.
Some is contracts, which, as discussed above, approximate market pricing on a short delay. That could result in another ~300bps of pricing normalization looking at 2021 vs. LTM (after all, the market was down 30% in 2Q vs. JKS down 10%, suggesting 500bps annualized over-earning, but it was not all from contracts).
All-in-all, we believe Jinko will catch up to the market, underperforming the spot price index by ~6ppts (3ppts from regional mix, 3ppts from contracts resetting lower or product mix deterioration). In a typical year the market price declines 17%, but there are unprecedented levels of supply entering the market for both wafers and modules so it could be worse. If the market price falls 17% and Jinko is 6ppts worse, then the company will experience 23% pricing declines, with further downside potential from the US pricing normalizing to global averages, FX headwind, etc. This would yield a pretty negative result, since unit cost reductions over time for these businesses should not be better than mid-teens. As a result, we project significant margin compression in our earnings model.
Source: company filings, our analysis
With mid-case ’21 EBITDA of $328mm, and a 7x EBITDA multiple, which seems more than fair looking at both the recent trading ranges (before this spike) and the generally low quality of the EBITDA number they report as a proxy for cash flow, the resultant price target is $13/sh, -77% from current.
    SECTION VI - APPENDIX
Solar modules are the main component of solar hard costs, thus module cost declines are the main driver of solar levelized cost of electricity (“LCOE”) savings. As such, it is unsurprising that module pricing per watt has consistently declined over any significant historical timeframe. The pricing CAGR from 2012 to 3Q20 was -17%:
Source: Energytrend
• The R-square between the chart above and Jinko’s reported quarterly selling prices since 2015 is 0.970, which is evidence both of the lack of differentiation in the module category and the validity of using market benchmarks as a proxy for Jinko’s own module pricing.
This deflationary trend has been driven mostly by the manufacturers adding scale—spreading fixed costs over an ever-wider volume base—and subtle tweaks to technology leading to larger and more efficient panels. These drivers of unit cost reduction both require a high level of continuous capital investment to keep up with competitors who are similarly adding capacity. As a result, through-the-cycle returns for solar companies are unimpressive. Below is JinkoSolar ROIC since the financial crisis:
Source: company filings
This is an emerging markets manufacturing business, and while earnings per share is somewhat meaningless due to the lack of any observable relationship with cash flow generation, the average forward P/E since Jinko even had positive expected earnings has been 4.75x, implying a cost of equity (and by extension a WACC) well in excess of the company’s ~6% ROIC. The chart above actually overstates industry returns due to “survivorship bias” since Jinko is one of the relatively few solar companies to survive this long without undergoing a debt restructuring. The “average” solar manufacturing ROIC would capture the many firms that have been forced to exit the industry or were delisted due to poor returns and would therefore be significantly lower than Jinko’s ~6%. Examples from the recent past include:
JA Solar (“JASO”, which traded down from >$100/ADR to $7.55 before being restructured in a management take-private in July of 2018)
Trina Solar (“TSL”, which traded down from >$30/ADR before also being taken private in March of 2017 at $11.60)
Yingli Green Energy (“YGE”, which is a penny stock today after peaking at over $350/ADR)
The continuous and rapid expansion of wattage per module, driven in turn by persistent reinvestment of any operating cash flows (or more, likely, proceeds from capital issuance), has the other consequence of causing rapid technological obsolescence, such that a module produced today must be quickly sold or its value in several months is significantly impaired. Working capital is a persistent headwind as a solar manufacturer adds scale to reduce unit costs, and manufacturers often drive sales by extending credit to poorly-capitalized developer counterparties. Below is Jinko’s net income vs. free cash flow (the only year of positive FCF since the company has reported financials came during a year of negative net income):
Source: company filings
In Jinko’s case, the reported EBITDA number is also fairly useless in understanding the cash flows of the business – in years in which Jinko even had positive EBITDA, the average conversion of EBITDA to operating cash flows is -3.7%:
Source: company filings
These long-term features of the solar module manufacturing industry–double-digit price deflation, ROIC < cost of capital, and persistent cash burn—are structural and unlikely to change anytime soon in our view. It is a tough business where operators must run to stand still and thus should garner a low valuation multiple. Historically, we believe that the best time to short module manufacturing stocks is when gross margins are at peak since that is when module manufacturers are most incentivized to overbuild new capacity.  The lack of industry consolidation suggests this trend is highly susceptible to repeat. 
Demand – China
China – China accounted for 33GW of demand in 2019 (several GWs of projects auctioned in 2019 were pushed into 1H20), and BNEF has midpoint forecast of 40GW in 2020 and 51GW in 2021. There is significant near-term risk to the 2020 volume forecast, since developers and manufacturers are playing a game of chicken over whether the 3Q polysilicon inflation will be passed through or whether developers will simply wait for lower prices to come along. The standoff is with respect to $0.015-0.020/W of increase, which is +8-11%. Our research suggests 8-9GW of demand is at risk based on the trend in module prices through year-end, some of which would be embedded in the BNEF number. They, JKS and CSIQ have said that they hope to recover most but not all of the inflation. Whatever of the 40GW does not fall in 2020 will simply be pushed into 1H21, so it is not a significant concern—the magnitude of feed-in tariff foregone from a later commissioning is not enough to incentivize developers to pay the higher module prices prevailing today.
Central government’s new five-year plan
So far it seems that an announcement from the central government regarding the new five year plan for renewables development is likely in 4Q20, and the draft proposal looks like an average of ~60GW per year of deployments, which probably ramps from ~50GW in 2021 to >60GW in 2025. So far the central planned solar scheme has been a failure in many ways, characterized by late subsidy payments, grid curtailments due to congestion, lengthy interconnection queues and resultant financial distress among private developers as project IRRs have deteriorated.
Feed-in tariff going to grid parity?
The move to grid parity has been met with enthusiasm by industry participants, both as a sign that solar LCOE is now below the marginal cost of coal generation, and because of the issues that plagued the feed-in tariff scheme. We believe the change is not as transformational as it may sound. Rather than resembling a western merchant power market, there are still implicit subsidies granted by the central government to encourage solar development, including grid interconnection priority over coal, a 30-year PPA of sorts that benchmarks to the coal RMB/kWh price, the tax, credit and land concessions that were in place before, and of course the fact that most utility-scale solar development is done by SOEs that are ultimately answerable to the central government. The annual auctions, the source of much of the historical lumpiness in the Chinese market, will occur as before, except now the developers are competing for grid slots instead of subsidies.
Bloomberg takes the view that demand is high and the economics are in the money for grid parity, so there should not be a big dip in demand next year. But no one really has any visibility since these projects will not even be allocated before 2Q21 and will not commission until 4Q21, preserving the typical mad-rush seasonality that characterized the prior regime. As a counter-argument to Bloomberg’s view, the last time they froze subsidies was 2018, and that did not end well (installations fell 16% Y-o-Y).
2021 and beyond
The BNEF projections represent a good base case, but we believe there is more downside than upside risk given the change in incentives, the current lack of visibility into the project pipeline, and the fact that key sources of historical volume disappointment—late year deployment rush, limited interconnection capacity—have remained. 2021 demand of 51GW gets them back to near peak historical development, and then BNEF assumes a modest slump to 46GW in 2022 in the mid-case. So nothing too exciting here.
The U.S.
Is the US the hidden profit center of Jinko? How much does it matter?
The company’s disclosure does not distinguish the profitability of the US market, and it is an increasingly important question since Jinko could (a) benefit immensely from a volume bump in the US if it represents a disproportionate amount of earnings, or (b) suffer a significant blow if the tariffs propping up earnings are removed.
Here is what is known based on company commentary – North America represented 8% of 2018 shipments, 17% of 2019 shipments and something guided larger, ~20%, of 2020 shipments. In 2018, sales to North America were 11% of the total and in 2019 were 25% of the total. It is not easy to say exactly where pricing will shake out in 2020, but in our mid-case, JKS will derive around 30% of revenues from the US in 2020. The company appears to have quickly retooled following the imposition of the 201 tariffs in 2018 and has grown US revenues by ~$500mm in each of the two years since, likely because Chinese peers were not able to get SE Asian (i.e. 301 tariff-free) capacity online as quickly as Jinko did. The charts below demonstrate that SE Asian imports completely dominate the mix of US imports, led by Malaysia:
U.S. Imports of PV Modules
Source: BNEF
Based on management commentary during 2019, Jinko was earning margins significantly above corporate average in the US, we estimate up to 30%. Those margins have likely taken a step down in the second half of 2020, but we assume the full year averages out around 27%.
As the BNEF analysis makes clear, 2021 may not be a big year for US module imports, since almost half of demand will be met by inventories already sitting on-hand. But even assuming Jinko manages to ship another gigawatt of modules Y-o-Y, or 5GW, into the US in 2021 (and bear in mind they only had 3.4GW of capacity that can economically serve the US, last anyone knew), regional mix will be a significant headwind in 2021 (around 300bps impact on selling price change Y-o-Y), and they will have trouble growing the gross profit dollars of the US business in a scenario where prices and margins are normalizing to the levels of the rest of the world:

Business Overview
The Children’s Place is the largest pure-play children’s specialty apparel retailer in North America with annual sales of ~$1.7 billion and a market capitalization of ~$1.2 billion.  It sells apparel, accessories and shoes under the Children’s Place brand for children ranging from newborn to ten years old.  Children’s Place is a value-priced retailer targeting low to middle income consumers via a high-low promotional model.  The company operates ~1,070 stores in mall, outlet and value center locations in the U.S. and Canada.  It generates ~10% of its sales from e-commerce.  The business has a strong balance sheet, with net cash of over $160 million, and is highly cash generative. 
  The crux of our investment thesis in Children’s Place is that (a) there is substantial opportunity to improve profitability, as the company historically has been poorly managed and its 6-7% U.S. EBIT margin is well below the margins of most specialty apparel retailers in the U.S., (b) we expect margins to improve significantly as the company’s new management team implements retail best-practices across the organization, (c) we believe the market is underestimating the likelihood and magnitude of margin improvement in the business in the next two years, and (d) the business is trading at 54% of sales, 5.2x EV-to-EBIT and 10x net income based on our forecast of the earnings power of a “fixed” PLCE two years from now.
  An investment in Children’s Place is extremely timely as the company has been in the midst of a turnaround for 1.5 years with significant improvements having been masked by cotton pressure and the warmest winter on record in sometime that derailed 2011 progress.  Bears point to the company’s lack of ability to improve sales productivity, however, Q212 demonstrated that going forward comparable sales will increase now that the company has lapped inventory and product mix adjustments in their Outlet and Canadian channels.  Throughout the past year Outlet which represents greater than 20% of total sales had comps decline double digits as the company moved away from a clearance model to a made for outlet strategy.  We believe Q312 will be the key turning point for the story as the enhanced earnings power of the business begins to show through as gross margins, operating margins and comparable sales increase.  After delivering many years with operating earnings of 6-8% we believe that earnings will now accelerate quickly to 10% in the next two years.  After waiting more than a year to see the fruits of management’s changes investors will now see it flow through to significant earnings improvement.
  The stock currently trades at ~$55 per share.  We have a $70 price target. 
  Why PLCE is an Attractive Investment
Like many turnaround stocks, Children’s Place has had a troubled operating history.  This one happens to be quite a soap opera.  We describe this history in detail below as we believe it provides important context for our belief that there is room for significant improvement in the business.
The company was founded in the 1980s by Ezra Dabah, who was the company’s CEO from 1988 to 2007 and took the company public in 1991.  While a successful entrepreneur who deserves credit for creating the concept and building it to scale, Mr. Dabah’s “growth at all costs” mindset ultimately created many problems for the organization. 
One example of this was the company’s disastrous agreement in 2004 with The Walt Disney Company  (“Disney”) pursuant to which Children’s Place licensed the right to operate the 313-store Disney retail chain in North America.  Mr. Dabah believed that combining the Disney brand with Children’s Place’s expertise in sourcing, merchandising and systems infrastructure would substantially increase Disney’s sales and margins, thereby growing earnings and strengthening Children’s Place’s leading position in the newborn to age ten category.  Mr. Dabah’s plan also envisioned doubling the size of the Disney chain through expansion into additional malls and shopping centers.
However, what was viewed initially as a new growth vehicle for PLCE quickly became an albatross for the company and for Mr. Dabah.  The Disney deal never met the company’s aggressive growth projections and the licensing deal saddled the company with substantial remodel obligations.  In 2007, Disney accused PLCE of committing numerous violations of the license agreement, including the failure to meet certain remodel obligations.  In settlement of these claims, PLCE committed to an additional $175 million in capital expenditures between 2007 and 2011 to fund the remodel of 234 existing Disney stores into a new store prototype.  This settlement increased the company’s cumulative remaining remodeling and maintenance obligation to $320 million, which was a significant obligation for a company that at the time was not generating positive free cash flow.  In 2008, with the Disney retail stores losing money and the company facing onerous capital spending obligations, the Board decided to shut the business down and to return the license to Disney.
Mr. Dabah’s growth ambitions were not limited to Disney.  Between 2003 and 2007, PLCE grew its square footage by 38%.  Many of the site locations chosen over this period were poor, causing these stores to dramatically underperform the rest of the chain.  Included in this investment program were 68 stores of an untested prototype that proved too large and costly to build.  Also in 2007, Children’s Place launched a new ”store-within-a-store” shoe concept, opening 54 new stores that were 25% larger than a typical store.  After signing long-term leases for these larger stores, the concept flopped and the company was forced to abandon the strategy and impair these assets.
As a result of these missteps and others, PLCE’s earnings declined substantially.  Operating income for PLCE’s U.S. stores declined by 65% in fiscal 2007, and the Disney Stores lost money.  Earnings per share declined from $2.84 in fiscal 2006 to $1.53 in fiscal 2007.
Beyond the many strategic and tactical errors, Mr. Dabah also exhibited questionable judgment on multiple occasions that raised doubts about his ethics.  In late 2006, the Board opened an investigation into the company’s dating of stock option grants.  While no intentional wrongdoing was uncovered, the investigation forced the company to restate its financial statements for 2003 through 2007.  In response to the results of this investigation, the Board added two independent directors and replaced Mr. Dabah as Chairman.
In September 2007, the company discovered that Mr. Dabah had violated its Code of Conduct.  Specifically, Mr. Dabah had failed to comply with internal policies regarding securities trades when he pledged shares to a margin account during a blackout period.  Around this time, Deloitte resigned as the company’s auditor, citing its unwillingness to rely on Mr. Dabah’s representations in connection with its audits. 
Finally in 2007, the Board of Directors decided it had enough and it fired Mr. Dabah.  Unfortunately, he did not go quietly.  As the company’s largest shareholder and still a Director, his presence continued to destabilize the business over the next several years.  Soon after his firing, he filed a lawsuit against the company and forced PLCE to hire an investment bank to conduct a review of strategic alternatives for the business.  In the midst of the strategic review process, in February 2008, Mr. Dabah sent a letter to the Board indicating his interest in making an offer to purchase the company.  The purported bid of $24 per share never materialized, and the strategic review was completed in February 2009 without receiving any credible offers. 
Mr. Dabah was not finished.  In May 2009, he notified the company that he intended to nominate three new directors to the Board.  If successful, this would have given him control of the company, as he and his father-in-law already served as directors of a nine-person Board.  In July 2009, just days ahead of the scheduled shareholders meeting, the company reached a settlement agreement with Mr. Dabah.  Under the terms of the settlement, PLCE agreed to buy back half his shares at a 5% discount to the then-prevailing stock price and to register his remaining shares for a secondary offering.  Mr. Dabah and his father-in-law resigned from the Board, withdrew their proposed slate of directors and agreed not to vote at the shareholders meeting.  The repurchase, at ~$29 per share, was 7-10% accretive to earnings.  Mr. Dabah subsequently sold his remaining shares and today holds no shares in the company.
Not surprisingly, the distractions caused by Mr. Dabah in the years following his departure as CEO, including forcing a formal sales process, made it impossible for PLCE to attract a permanent CEO.  With the settlement behind them, the Company accelerated its search.  Five months later, the company announced the appointment of Jane Elfers as CEO.  Ms. Elfers joined PLCE in January 2010 from Lord & Taylor, where she had been CEO for eight years and was credited with leading a turnaround of the business.  She is known as a top-notch merchant and a tough, disciplined leader.
  Investment Thesis
Our investment thesis is predicated on our belief that there is substantial room for Children’s Place to expand its margins and that the new management team, led by Ms. Elfers, is a huge upgrade to its predecessors and will serve as the change agent to drive this improvement. 
The greatest room for improvement is in PLCE’s U.S. operations where operating margins of 6-7% significantly lag those of its specialty apparel peers.  While few companies in the industry separate Canada from the U.S. as PLCE does (making direct U.S. to U.S. comparisons difficult), even looking at it on a North American basis illustrates that PLCE’s 8% margins are below the apparel-retailer average of 11%.  Management has set forth a long-term objective of double digit operating margins and we believe that, with better management and execution, PLCE can achieve this.

Source:   FactSet
While Ms. Elfers has laid out a detailed list of initiatives to grow the company and improve its profitability, we believe this is, at its core, a margin improvement story.  There are two main drivers of margin improvement: one is more conservative inventory management, and the other is addressing the company’s troubled outlet channel.  Below, we describe the company’s initiatives in these two areas in detail.
1)      Better buying.  Prior to Ms. Elfers’ arrival, Children’s Place was an undisciplined company that was run for volume rather than profit.  Too often, the company developed overly optimistic sales forecasts, which led to over-buying and heavy discounting of excess product.  The old retail motto “pile it high and let it fly” applied to PLCE.  Further, the company applied the same buying strategies for each of its four channels (U.S. full line stores, Canada, outlet and internet).  Little thought was given to whether the products and volumes purchased for a particular channel were appropriate for that selling channel.  Moreover, because they bought so much product up-front, PLCE’s buyers were not given “open-to buy” flexibility to purchase more of those items that were selling well.  The result of these poor purchasing decisions was that historically only 20% of PLCE’s product was sold at full price versus 40% for the industry.  Naturally, this lack of planning and discipline negatively impacted margins. 
  Conversely, Ms. Elfers believes that inventory management is the key to profitability and has quickly brought this discipline to the PLCE culture.  Under her leadership, initial buys are smaller, replenishments more frequent and assortments narrower – all of which should lead to less frequent and shallower mark-downs.  At the beginning of her tenure, Ms. Elfers’ “value over volume” strategy worked as gross margins expanded from Q410 to Q311.  This improvement in gross margin occurred even in the face of declining comparable store sales and significant promotional activity from its competitors, as PLCE was willing to sacrifice revenue for profitability.  Unfortunately, management’s gross margin improvement paused for a few quarters as record cotton prices across the industry pressured gross margin.  Entering Q312 cost inflation pressures have disappeared as input costs have stabilized allowing management to return their energy to improving gross margins and sales.  Another sign of the effectiveness of PLCE’s new “pull versus push” strategy is lower levels of “carryover inventory”, which represents inventory from the prior season that was not sold and therefore was “carried over” into the current season.  PLCE’s carryover inventory declined by 39% in Q4 2010, 15% year-over-year in Q1 2011 and 29% year-over-year in Q2 2011.  We expect to see further gross margin improvement as the quarter’s progress, particularly as the company laps the impact of this year’s high cotton prices in the upcoming 2H 2012.
  2)      Outlets.  Under previous management, merchandise managers at PLCE’s full line stores were not held accountable for overbuying.  Rather, they utilized the company's outlet stores as a dumping ground for product that could not be sold in the full-line stores.  Outlets did not have their own buyers or their own separate product; instead, their role in the company was to serve as a trash-receptacle for poor decisions made by the full-line stores.  As a result, PLCE’s outlet stores were barely profitable under prior management.  In comparison, for most apparel retailers, outlet is the most profitable channel other than e-commerce.  This is meaningful to our investment in PLCE because outlet represents greater than 20% of PLCE’s overall sales.
  Under Ms. Elfers’ leadership, the company has appointed separate leadership for each channel, including outlet, and assigned these leaders full P&L responsibility.  The company now plans its inventory buys by channel and budgets for the clearance of most product within the same channel for which it was originally purchased.  This latter change fundamentally alters the role of the outlet channel within the company.  PLCE is now designing outlet-exclusive product, which is common practice in the industry.  In 2010, only 3% of PLCE’s outlet sales came from made-for-outlet product.  In 2H 2012, the number is expected to be 65%.  Thus, rather than the outlets selling product that consumers did not want, at steep discounts, they will be selling made-for-outlet product with fewer and shallower discounts. 
  We expect these changes to be a critical driver of margin improvement, as historically gross merchandise margins at PLCE’s outlets have lagged those of the full-line stores by ~1,000 basis points.  In comparison, most apparel retailers enjoy higher merchandise margins in the outlet channel than in their full-line stores.  While the full line stores will lose some margin themselves from having to clear their own merchandise, we estimate that closing the gross merchandise margin gap between outlets and full-line stores will drive 125 basis points of consolidated margin improvement, equivalent to $0.50 per share or 16% on PLCE’s 2011 earnings.
  There is much more to Ms. Elfers’ turnaround plan than what we have described in this letter.  Based on the totality of her plan, our knowledge of how poorly the company was run before she arrived, our familiarity with how PLCE stacks up relative to the rest of the industry from a best practices standpoint and our confidence in her and her management team to execute, we believe that the company will be able to achieve double digit margins on a consolidated basis within two years.  In addition to the benefits of the initiatives described above, we believe that PLCE’s earnings this year are depressed due to headwinds from cotton price inflation.  In order to achieve management’s double digit operating margin goal we do acknowledge that sales productivity must be improved.  This is why we believe an investment in PLCE in Q312 is very timely as management has finally lapped the two large overhangs that have been holding back the company from producing positive comparable sales – Outlet and Canadian sales.  As management made significant changes to inventory levels, assortment mix and began to implement the made for outlet product both channels pressured PLCE overall comparable store sales.  For instance, until Q212 outlet was running at double digit declines.  Q312 will be the first full quarter that both outlet and Canadian comparable sales should approach flat levels which will allow the improvements at the US full line PCLE stores to drive the performance.
Our Projections:
We estimate that in two years time (fiscal 2014, which ends in January 2015), PLCE will generate a 9.5% operating margin and earn ~$5.10 per share.  This is 22% higher than the current consensus of $4.18.  Beyond our EBIT margin estimate, our forecasts assume that PLCE is able to stabilize same-store sales trends starting in Q312 as it has fully re-based its inventory levels; specifically, we assume 2% annual growth in same-store sales.  Further, our model assumes that PLCE uses all of its excess domestic free cash flow to repurchase stock at 15x earnings, consistent with the company’s practice since Mr. Dabah’s departure. 
  Price Target / Valuation
After reporting strong earnings last week with strong positive comparable sales for the first time in many quarters, the stock current trades ~$55 per share.  At this recent price, it has a market capitalization of ~$1.35 billion and an enterprise value of ~$1.2 billion.  In fiscal 2012, we believe consensus estimates are too low for the 2H of the year as we think management has taken a strategy of under promising and over delivering.  Consensus expects PLCE to generate sales of $1.8 billion, operating profit of $121 million and EPS of $3.28.  We think the business trades at full multiples based on current consensus estimates, however, with the turnaround gaining speed in Q312 we think this presents a unique buying opportunity as consensus operating margins remain at the low end of PLCE’s historical range at 6.7%.  We think in a bear case scenario the business will continue to earn 2012 levels of EBIT (~6-7%) and thus you are underwriting the downside case at a valuation of ~74% of sales, 9x EBIT, 15x earnings and 14x cash-adjusted earnings.   
Two years from now based on our earnings forecasts and our assumption that the company will use its free cash flow to repurchase stock, the company would be trading at 54% of sales, 5.2x EV-to-EBIT and 10x earnings.  These multiples are not only well-below PLCE’s current trading multiples but they are equally far below the average multiples that PLCE received over the 2005-10 period (71% of sales, 8.4x EBIT and 15.4x P/E).  Thus, we believe that we are getting the earnings improvement that we expect for free.
  Our price target range for Children’s Place is $70 per share, which represents a 26% premium to the current share price.  At our price target, PLCE would trade at 72% of sales, 7.1x EBIT and 13.4x earnings, which is still below the company’s historic and current trading multiples. 
Our assessment of this investment includes a downside case and an upside case.  Our downside case assumes that management is not able to improve the margin profile of the business.  In this scenario, we estimate 2013 earnings of $3.00 per share based on a 6.5% operating margin.  In our upside case, we assume the company can reach a 12.5% operating margin and generate $6.90 in earnings per share. 
  As with all investments, there are risks involved.  Below we describe some of the greatest risks:
1)      Weak consumer.  One obvious risk to our investment is macroeconomic risk.  High unemployment and inflation continue to pressure PLCE’s core lower-to-middle income consumer and it is not hard to envision an economic scenario where these pressures increase.  Fortunately, while apparel is by-and-large a discretionary purchase, we take some comfort in the fact that the children’s category has substantially outperformed the rest of the apparel industry over the last five years as parents have chosen to trim their own discretionary spending before cutting back spending on their children.
  2)      Fashion misses.  Without question, the PLCE turnaround hinges in part on consumer reception of its merchandise, ~60% of which is considered “fashion” rather than basics.  While we are hopeful that Ms. Elfers’ track record of success as a merchant is a driver of upside for our investment thesis, we recognize that there is an element of fashion risk for any apparel business, even in children’s apparel.  Like investors, all merchants make mistakes from time to time, which adds volatility to earnings.
  3)      Competition.  It is no secret that the children’s apparel environment is extremely competitive.  Parents have numerous alternatives when shopping for children’s apparel, including department stores, mass merchants and specialty retailers.  Within specialty retail, the children’s space has many offerings, including long-standing concepts such as GapKids, Old Navy, Gymboree and Carter’s, and new concepts such as Crazy 8 and 77Kids.  Over time, product differentiation has declined, causing price and promotions to play a bigger role in determining where consumers purchase their apparel.  If industry inventory levels were to rise significantly due to a further slowdown in consumer sentiment, this could offset some of the margin improvements we expect to see over time.
  4)      Canada.  Historically, Canada has been by far the company’s most profitable channel.  Over the last five years, margins have averaged over 17% versus under 6% for the company’s U.S. operations.  This huge margin gap stems from the fact that the children’s apparel marketplace historically has been underserved.  However, in recent years, strong children’s apparel retailers such as Target and Carter’s have expanded in Canada and we expect margin pressure to accelerate as a result.  Since peaking in 2007 at ~20%, PLCE’s Canadian margins have declined to 13%.  Our models assume further deterioration in the near future before stabilization at 13% in fiscal 2014.

Investment Thesis
SWKS is a play on data connectivity.  It is a business with a rare combination of competitive moat and secular tailwind - 5G and Internet-of-Things (IoT) - that can reasonably be expected to last multi-decades; if history is any guide, 6G should launch in some time around 2030 and will be a secular growth driver then, and so on.  
  In addition, SWKS is in a net cash position, consistently generates 15-20% return on invested capital, and has a target of returning 60 - 75% of (company-defined) free cash flow through dividends and share repurchase.  A long position at $67.5 should provide at least 30% upside under conservative assumptions.
  Why Does This Opportunity Exists?
The short life cycle of radio frequency (RF) products, especially smartphones, means trends in revenue and earnings are volatile.  This cyclicality creates an attractive entry point from time to time. 
  Recently there were a clutch of negative news.  First, SWKS provided weak guidance in CQ-3Q18, citing weakness in high-end phones.  Second, Apple, which is the biggest customer of SWKS, stopped reporting iPhone sales numbers.  Third, there are reports that suppliers of Apple are cutting outputs. 
  Combined together, the reasoning goes, consumers are buying less smartphones, or at least high-end phones which have more RF content.  Therefore, the weakening fundamentals and the broader retreat of tech stocks drove SWKS stock to its 52 week low and created this opportunity.  
  Business Overview
SWKS designs, develops and manufactures semiconductors focused on RF which is vital for connectivity.  It is a premier supplier of highly-integrated RF solutions to smartphone makers and other electronics manufacturers.  Its portfolio is extensive and includes amplifiers, converters, diversity receive and front-end modules, power management, and antenna solutions.  
  Demand Drivers
Wireless network and demand for connectivity is driving demand for RF solutions in a number of ways.
  First, more devices (including phones and non-phones) have connectivity built-in as a basic feature, and each device requires RF components for connectivity.
Second, the increasing complexity of connectivity infrastructure (for example, from 3G to 4G, the latter uses a wider variety of spectrum and frequency bands) increases RF content per device.  As complexity intensifies, devices need to connect across various communication protocols, thus driving the number of RF content per device, and the need for higher-end, more expensive RF modules.  
  Third, the demand for faster network speed is another driver.  Faster speed can be achieved in two ways: 1) buy more spectrum and network equipment, which is expensive; or 2) utilize existing spectrum efficiently.  Carrier aggregation, which combines (more like mix and match) multiple frequency bands into a larger data pipeline, utilizes the second approach. To achieve carrier aggregation, more bands per device are required, and additional filters per device are needed to eliminate the interferences that accompany multiple bands usage.
    Furthermore, SWKS is expanding its solutions beyond smartphones and into additional end markets and customers including automotive, home and factory automation, infrastructure, medical, smart energy, and wireless networking.
  Secular Growth Opportunity: 5G and IoT
5G is the next generation of wireless network that has been launched in several countries, including by Verizon in the US, albeit in a smaller scale.  With data speed that is 10 - 100x faster than 4G, and much higher connection density – 1 million device per square kilometer vs 2000 device per square kilometer with 4G - it is indeed a game changer, similar to how smartphones impacted the TMT vertical.
  Internet of things, or IoT, is the interconnection of previously unconnected devices (beyond PC, laptops, tablets, smartphones) through the internet, to systems and applications that facilitate the exchange, and analytics of data.  5G will accelerate the growth of IoT by providing the data speed and connection density at levels that allow IoT to thrive. Devices that are already or expected to be connected include cars, factory equipments, wearable tech, home appliances and more.
    Besides being a secular tailwind for RF content in the next 8 to 10 years, 5G and IoT also reinforce the competitive strength of SWKS.  As the architectural design of 5G-connected devices becomes more complex, the value of an efficient RF front-end increases, which in turn makes SWKS’ expertise even more valuable to device makers.
    For reference, during 4G adoption (4G was launched in 2010), the revenue CAGR for SWKS was 16%, adjusted for acquisitions (but not adjusted for currency impact).  While it is impossible to quantify the revenue impact of 5G and IoT, it is reasonable to assume revenue CAGR to be higher going forward than 4G because: 1) the sheer volume of connected devices and use cases in 5G, especially for non-phone devices, is well beyond 4G, and will require a vast range of modules to accommodate different use cases and functions; 2) the RF semiconductor industry has consolidated considerably (Murata bought Peregrine, RFMD and TriQuint merged to form Qorvo) and thus relatively less competitive than before.
  That said, I am only assuming 10% normalized earning growth for margin of safety.
  Competitive Moat: 
The increasing complexity in architecture design acts as a barrier to entry; new entrants have to come up with superior RF content with a constantly evolving performance target.  What’s more, product life cycle is notoriously short, which means design wins do not translate into steady revenue.  Even if new entrants can secure a design win, they would be uncompetitive due to inferior production yield.
  Another competitive advantage is in the form of intangible assets: patents, experience and technical know-how; SWKS has years of experience in design, testing, quality control and manufacturing.  SWKS ability to integrate a wide range of functions and RF content into a single product has been difficult for others to replicate.
  The value-add of an efficient RF front-end exceeds its cost to OEMs and to some extent insulate SWKS from pricing pressure; the end-products sell for hundreds of dollars (i.e. wearable tech and phones) to hundreds of thousands of dollars (cars, medical devices).  It would be irrational for OEMs to sacrifice performance and reliability for savings of a few dollars per device. This is not to say there is no pricing pressure, but the pressure is less intense than a typical commoditized business.
  Why is weakening iPhone sales and Apple revenue concentration not a concern?
Because any resulting weakness from Apple is only transitory.  First, SWKS has existing business with Apple’s competitors. OEMs that take market share from Apple are an offset to revenue lost to Apple.  It is important to recognize causation - SWKS solid market share in high-end phones is a testament to its product capabilities. Those same capabilities is also attractive to other OEMs (e.g. Oppo, Huawei, Xiaomi) and allow SWKS to prepare for any market share changes in smartphones.
  Lastly, In the long term, reliance on phones will decrease as non-phone revenue should grow at a faster pace due to IoT. 
  Risks
Revenue and earnings are more volatile due to short design cycles and high customer concentration.
Fundamentals would inevitably turn, but can get much worse before it does. 
  Valuation Math
I use a normalized earnings approach to analyze SWKS due to its cyclicality.  Given its strong balance sheet, competitive position, and the secular earnings growth opportunity (10% per year) from 5G and IoT, I believe a multiple of 20 - 25x of my normalized earnings ($4.38) is warranted.  At 20x normalized EPS or $88 per share, this implies a 30% upside to current stock price. For context, consensus FY 19 EPS is $7.36. $88 implies 12x P/2019 E, which is at the lower end of its P/E NTM range of 9.5x - 20.5x in the last 5 years.
  Key Definition
Invested Capital = Interest bearing debt + Adjusted Equity + Operating lease capitalized at 8 times minus Cash.
  Average Invested capital is the average of the latest 5 quarters.  For example, FY 2017 invested capital is the average of 4Q16, 1Q17, 2Q17, 3Q17 and 4Q17.
  Operating earnings = Gross Profit – SG&A expense – R&D expense – Restructuring charge – acquisition related expense – R&D and capex + Depreciation and Amortization + stock-based comp + operating lease
  R&D and capex = R&D expense + capex + purchase of intangibles + acquisition; the latter two are treated as another form of R&D expense
  Adjusted earnings = Operating earnings – operating lease – interest expense – cash tax
  Adjustments made to Earnings
Add back stock-based compensation to earnings, and include non-vested shares and options to shares outstanding.  This is better because GAAP stock-based compensation crystallizes the cost but fails to capture the true cost of dilution.
  Treat operating lease as financing costs by adding back operating lease expense to operating earnings and deduct the expense as interest expense.
  Adjust for cash tax by adding back GAAP tax expense and deduct cash tax paid.
  Adjustments made to Equity for Invested Capital
Write-off deferred tax assets against equity
  Adjust for Gross Property and Equipment by crediting accumulated depreciation to equity
  Key Assumptions
1.  Assume EBITDAR margins would mean-revert to FY 2011 - 18 average, despite EBITDAR margins has improved to low 50 percentage points post 2015, primarily as a result of industry consolidation.
  2.  Assume R&D and capex, as a percentage of revenue, would mean-revert to FY 2011 - 18 dollar weighted average.

This is in our opinion a very opportunistic situation.
EGC (formerly EXXI) is a post-bankruptcy reorganization which has been posted in the past here. The reasons why the company actually filed for bankruptcy are quite clear: a former management which favoured acquisitions using leverage and the perils caused by a fixed cost base and declining oil prices. I will not delve too much into the bankruptcy as there is aboundant public information and will instead focus on the opportunity we find.
First and foremost the assets-
EGC has arguably one of the best collection of producing assets in shallow waters in the GOM. If valued as peers (WTI as an example), EGC would be worth 5x it's current price on proved reserves and 10x on proved and probable.
This company has a clean balance sheet but is hindered by ARO (abandonement obligations) for a variety of fields purchased from Exxon time ago which were uneconomical at sub $50 oil.
Because of it's ARO obligations and fixed cost basis, it is our belief that if oil prices (Brent) dip below $50 again, the equity is most likely to be worth zero. That is the bear case. However, we do believe there is a credible medium to long term thesis for oil stabilizing betweem $70 and $80. Just a matter of growing demand (China, India and other developing countries) with constrained supply. 
At current strip pricing, with no hedges going into 2019, EGC should generate around $280 million EBITDA next year, or around $100 million free cash flow. Which should by itself equate to a $30 dollar price per share vs it's current price of below $6 per share.
Post-bankruptcy the board of directors (guided by the majority owners, previous bondholders) had a mandate to sell the company. Given the then prevailing oil prices, that proved to be difficult and the company under invested and production declines followed. Production declined from nearly 40k boepd to 27k currently. This has changed. The board has changed and top level management has been replaced. The strategy in place today is to continue as a stand-alone entity, while remain receptive to potential offers. EGC was re-listed at around $30 per share last year, declining close to 90% to a recent low of $3.5 per share. We think this is a classic scenario where there were no natural holders left (Templeton and other bondholders indiscriminatley sold their holdings with no natural buyers) while the market was flooded by bad news. Which we believe is mostly priced in.
Also the company didn't help itself by guiding to the need for a capital raise (which we believe is necessary) in order to fund it's 2019 budget and thus have production growth. The flaw was in the guidance. Our belief is that the market ""assumed"" an equity dilution which in our opinion is all but necessary. Most likely (especially with current oil pricing) a debt/convertible raise will be the outcome.
The undervaluation is so evident that I'll let you run your numbers, we're talking about a 3x on a conservative scenario and 10x on a sustained brent price of $75 for the next couple of years. Using relative valuations without giving much credit to the reserve base of the company. Needless to say this was a $4-4.5 bn EV company two years ago and today trades for $100m EV, $600m if you count the ARO's which is aggressive enough in our opinion. With the exact same base of assets/reserves.
I'd rather delve on the next steps (underway) which should correct the valuation disparity (all with a 3-6 month timeframe):
1. EGC is looking to divest some of the properties which are not in their ""core"" geographic base. Because of the latter they're now uneconomical to them but are of great value to other players who have fields closer. By doing that they'd loose marginal cash flow but importantly would reduce their ARO's in a signifficant manner. Our meetings with management indicate between $300-$350 million in reduced plug and abondonement obligations vs the total of close to $500 currently. This is something we believe could happen within a month or so. Discussions are underway and in our opinion, current oil prices support such an outcome. This by itself should cause the stock to double immediately.
2. After that we expect a financing deal to be announced (on a non-dilutive manner) for $150-170 million which should cover 2019 enhanced budget and drive production back to a 33-35k boepd rate. Most likely debt/convert. That would be a second catalyst for the stock price.
3. As cash flow is generated we believe the company will pursue deals to buy on-shore properties which should help diversify the production base and hopefully aid in a multiple re-rating.
In summary, our opinion is that EGC is a busted bankruptcy play with little downside (as long as Brent remains above $50) and multiples of upside potential. 
For full disclosure we own around 8% of the company (at a cost basis very similar to today's prices).
   I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

MPAA IS ONE OF THE LEADING RE-MANUFACTURERS OF REPLACEMENT ALTERNATORS AND STARTERS FOR IMPORT AND DOMESTIC CARS IN THE UNITED STATES.

Their products are mainly sold to do-it-yourself installers through Autozone (AZ), CSK Automotive and O’Reilly Automotive and to a lesser extent to professional installers through traditional warehouse distributors. The Company is in the final innings of a turnaround story relating to the replacement of management due to accounting misstatements and the retooling of their manufacturing methods. It should be re-listed on the NASDAQ sometime in calendar year 2005 and is benefiting from increased business from its largest customers and a sound financial base.

MPAA has been in the automotive replacement parts business since the late 1960’s. In particular, the replacement of alternators and starters in cars is always done by remanufacturing used units. MPAA sources these parts by purchasing whole units from brokers, junkyards and automotive parts retailers. These used units are disassembled, cleaned and reassembled with replacement parts, tested and then shipped to retailers, manufacturers and wholesalers throughout the United States.

In 1997 and 1998 the Company had accounting irregularities that were perpetrated by the then CFO and CEO. These people were replaced and the Company settled a civil suit in 2002. All legal problems regarding this issue are now completely behind the Company. In February of 2003 the current CEO took control and began to work on bringing MPAA back from its near death experience. He instituted lean manufacturing methodologies, which has increased gross margin and decreased the turnaround time in re-manufacturing units from days to hours. Recently, MPAA won the Frost & Sullivan 2004 Product Quality Leadership Award for its segment of the automotive parts market.

With the filing of the March 2004 annual report, MPAA was in compliance with Nasdaq listing by having 5 years of audited financials and is in the process of reapplying for listing. This is delayed by the second quarter’s (September 30, 2004) accounting change to record revenues net of the cost of repurchased AS cores. This has NO effect on Operating or Net Profits as it is simply a reclassification of the cost of these repurchases from its customers and is an offset to COGS and revenues.

I believe that the common stock of MPAA is undervalued using a number of metrics and has the ability to double in price as the market begins to recognize its value and earnings potential.

THE ALTERNATOR AND STARTER MARKET PROVIDES STABLE REVENUE FLOW AND CONSOLIDATION OPPORTUNITIES.

Alternators and Starters (AS) are the electric generators/motors that power the electrical systems in automobiles. Each car manufactured has one of each and the complexity and design of each unit varies depending on the make, model and year of the car. The car manufacturer stops making that particular AS once a car is off production for that model year. When that AS wears out (prime repair age of 7 years), the car owner needs to purchase a re-manufactured AS. With the average age of autos in the US at 9 years and growing and the increasing demand for mnore electronics in cars, demand for AS has been growing. The increasing complexity of automotive electronics also leads to increased pricing for alternators.

Consumers have two methods of installing AS. One is to do-it-yourself (DIY) and the other is to use a professional installer. MPAA primarily (90%+) sells to the DIY through relationship with large automotive retailers. It largest customers are Autozone, CSK Automotive and O’Reilly Automotive. The professional market is a revenue opportunity for MPAA that it has begun to exploit with a deal with one of the largest automotive wholesalers. At its December shareholders meeting, management stated that this relationship is going better than expected due to MPAA’s superior product quality compared to the company it replaced.

AUTOZONE DEAL RESULTED IN UNDERSTATED REVENUES IN THE FIRST HALF OF FY 2005, BUT WILL INSURE STRONG SECOND HALF, ROBUST LONG-TERM GROWTH AND AN IMPROVED COMPETITVE POSITION

In May of 2004, MPAA signed a deal with Autozone that made the Company its exclusive supplier of imported and the larger of two suppliers for domestic AS. While MPAA was already a vendor in this area, the deal should increase sales for fiscal 2005 (March FYE) and beyond. As part of the deal MPAA agreed to purchase all of AZ’s AS inventory and only bill AZ for AS’s as they are sold (consignment). Autozone will be paid for the inventory over a four year period of time in a backend weighted transaction as shown in the following table.


Fiscal Quarter Inv. Payment to AZ


Q2 2005 1,200,000
Q3 2005 2,600,000
Q4 2005 2,700,000
Q1 2006 3,180,000
Q2 2006 3,270,000
Q3 2006 3,270,000
Q4 2006 3,270,000
Q1 2007 1,141,000
Total 20,631,000

After two years, if the transaction is going well, MPAA will buy the remaining $24 million of inventory in the same manner.

An important difference resulting from the AZ deal is the change in revenue recognition from Pay-on-Delivery to AZ to Pay-on-Scan (sale to AZ’s customer). For the second quarter ended September 30, MPAA disclosed that shipments to AZ were $9.6MM above recorded sales for the first five months of the relationship, effectively understating reported revenues. This will translate into additional sales of $7.7MM for the second half of FY 2005 based on AZ’s turning the inventory every 7.5 months. The effect of the deal is neutral to balance sheet cash over time but MPAA will build inventory that turns about 2x per year at its largest customer. This inventory must be purchased by AZ if it ever wants to break the deal, so MPAA will have a long term investment in the largest automotive retailer that will be booked as inventory. The Company estimates that this number is currently $36MM and will grow to $60MM when they exercise the second option, creating a nearly insurmountable barrier to entry for any competitor.

MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCIES PROVIDING IMPROVED MARGINS.

MPAA switched to lean manufacturing in 2002, which has significantly improved turnaround time and gross margins when re-manufacturing AS. Cores are received in its Los Angeles, California facility and separated by product family and part number. Each lot moves to a station that only works on that particular AS. In a matter of an hour it moves from a useless core to a clean, tested working AS. This process has high degree of automation and maximizes recovery of materials. Specifically, the Company recognized a 40% gain in capacity, 20% reduction in labor content and 63% reduction in work in process inventory. Gross margins have responded correspondingly rising approximately 600 basis points from FY 2002 to FY 2004. In the first two quarters of FY 2005, gross margins were impacted by increased overtime hours needed to handle the quick ramp up in sales to Autozone. These margins should normalize in the second half of FY 2005, since the ramp-up is done.

MPAA also has a manufacturing facility in Malaysia where it produces some AS for the US market. The Company recently announced it will be opening a plant in Mexico that will lead to lower labor costs over the long term. The plant will open at the end of fiscal 2005 (March) and slowly ramp until it is running at full speed by that year’s end. Since MPAA uses lean manufacturing, it will be able to move one product line at a time over to the new plant and help mitigate the risk of the move. MPAA’s Southern California Plant will be shutdown at the end of this process. For FY 2006 this should lead to significantly lower cost, which will hopefully translate into increased margins.

MULTIPLE REVENUE GROWTH OPPORTUNITES.

MPAA has a number of opportunities to increase its revenue base. The first involves increasing the number of SKU’s it handles by broadening its product base to includes motorcycles, watercraft, heavy-duty trucks, fork lifts and other adjacent categories. Since the process is the same to work on these AS products it is just a matter of creating the distribution to handle the increased output. The second opportunity is to penetrate these additional markets. The professional installation market is traditionally reached through using wholesalers. Recently the Company announced a new relationship in this area. The third and final growth opportunity is acquisitions. There are two large companies operating in this market other than MPAA. Both are subsidiaries of larger companies and according to MPAA management ripe to be sold due to their performance. A small number of other re-manufacturers are available and could add to MPAA’s market share in the professional market.

SECOND QUARTER RESULTS AND RE-STATEMENT OF REVENUES AND COST OF GOODS SOLD.

MPAA had a solid second quarter with revenues growing 6% year over year. Operating profit was flat due to the costs associated with the ramp up in the AZ business. According to management, these costs are now behind the Company.

During the quarter, the Company and the SEC concluded that MPAA should state its revenues on a net and not a gross basis. This has caused MPAA to delay filing their 10-Q and its auditor’s to withdraw their opinion on the 2004 audit until the restatement is finished. I talked to the Grant Thornton partner at the Company’s annual meeting last week and they confirmed that the re-audit is only on how to show the revenues and that it shouldn’t affect operating or net profit. This re-audit will be done a quickly as possible, but no one will guarantee the date to me. I expect it to be done in early January, since December is a short month.

VALUATION MULTIPLE SHOULD EXPAND TO INDUSTRY NORM.

MPAA trades at a discount to its relevant peers and the market despite its very realizable growth opportunities. MPAA trades at 4.6x EBITDA with $12.5MM of trailing EBITDA and an enterprise value of $58MM ($64.5MM Market Value Equity – $10.7MM Cash + $1.3 Debt), MPAA also has Net Operating Loss carry-forwards of $11.7MM and $7.5MM for federal and state taxes, which will be used over the next couple of years. The closest two public comparable companies are Standard Motor Products (SMP, NYSE 12X EBITDA, 33.5x trailing 12 months EPS, 26X forward EPS) and Aftermarket Technology Corporation (ATAC, NASDAQ 8x Normalized EBITDA, 14x trailing 12 months EPS, 12X forward EPS). Using these figures in the chart below, yields a value for MPAA of between $13.50 and $27.80 per share. The FY05E numbers are calendar year for the comparables and March 2006 FY for MPAA.

Another company to use for valuation purposes is Edelbrock (EDEL), which is going private in a management buyout at about 30x EPS and 7x EBITDA. I think this sets a good floor valuation since EDEL was a quasi-public company with management owning over 50% of the shares and taking high compensation in a business that hasn’t grown in over 5 years. Using these numbers, MPAA’s is worth $21.98 and $9.28, respectively in a base scenario.

ATAC 14.0 x 12.0 x 8.0 x NA

Average 23.8 x 19.0 x 10.0 x 8.0 x


MPAA Proj Stock Price $16.80 $27.80 $13.48 $18.22

My projections used for MPAA in the table above are shown below. Fiscal year 2005 projections on sales growth are based on management’s detail of the revenues it will garner from the AZ deal and the wholesale deals signed this year. Management reiterated these numbers in their annual meeting last week. The fiscal year 2006 projections are based on the current business plus the recently announced new business deals and a market growth rate of 3%. FY ’06 is the first year I project with normalized business operations, eliminating charges related to legal expenses and other restructuring costs, and allowing the company to reap the benefits of its restructuring of manufacturing and customer agreements. FY 2007 is expected to benefit from the move of manufacturing to Mexico, where employment costs are 10% of the US.

Conclusion: Over the past three years MPAA has restructured its infrastructure, including management and manufacturing, while improving its financial stability and eliminating SEC overhangs. I believe the company is fast becoming the supplier of choice for related products amongst major auto-part retailers and wholesalers as evidenced by the new Autozone (AZO) and wholesale agreements. The recognition of Pay-on-Scan sales shipments already made, improving margins, strong cash flow, a clean balance sheet plus acquisition opportunities provide stability and growth avenues. Re-listing and earnings growth normalization ( following one-time charges) should provide upside based on multiple expansion and cleaner earnings picture, which should enable the stock to reach my price target of $16.00 per share in 2005.
Catalyst
1. Earning per share and revenue growth – MPAA is well positioned to generate increased revenues and earnings per share.
2. New Business Relationships- May 2004 Autozone deal has lead to an increase in shipments of $9.6MM (over 10% sales growth) that will be recognized in the second half of FY 2005.
3. Industry consolidation – MPAA will play a role in industry consolidation. The management team is financially motivated to be either an acquirer or acquiree.
4. Nasdaq re-listing –MPAA will have 5 years of audited financials. This fact, coupled with their profitability will enable MPAA to re-list on NASDAQ.",37.499999215728344,47.3684203921923,30.921051764752384,61.84210980367798,2.945604586746482,0.6099567120877967,6.252471661021844,5.849190936121613

Every few years, Overstock (OSTK) gives us the opportunity to short a sub-scale, structurally challenged e-com retailer at an insane valuation. Now is one of those times. Momentum in the stock has turned over with shares peaking at ~$130 in late August (up from <$5 pre-Covid) and now trading at $67 ($2.45B TEV). Borrow is available (25 bps borrow cost) and the stock is liquid, trading ~$500mm per day.
  Prior to Covid, OSTK was a declining web 1.0 retailer that was consistently loss-making. Retail revenues peaked at $1.8B in 2018 and were $1.4B in 2019 – on par with results in 2013/2014. Before the recent surge in online ordering due to Covid, OSTK was expected to generate $1.4B in revs in both 2020 and 2021 (see below). 
    [Source: atom.finance]
  This 8 years of no revenue growth is against a backdrop of significant e-com share growth in OSTK’s most important category, furniture and home furnishings (see below). The market correctly recognized this, and the company traded for a partly EV of ~$100mm on this loss-making ~$1.4B of revenues (
  With the surge in demand for home furniture / furnishings due to Covid, even OSTK saw a massive increase in sales in Q2. As a result, the company reported ~110% revenue growth / ~$770mm vs. the decline / ~$350mm that would have been typical of the company. This allowed OSTK to put up ~$50mm of quarterly EBITDA as opposed to the normal negative EBITDA of the trailing four quarters (see below).
  In normal times, being an e-com furniture retailer with no owned brands is a terrible business. You pay extremely high CACs via digital marketing to acquire mostly one-time customers, and then need to pay expensive freight to deliver heavy, bulky items. This is how you wind up with OSTK’s 20% gross margins and zero EBITDA generation. Note that in Q2, sales and marketing spend was still 10% of revenues (in-line with history) – it’s not like the Overstock brand suddenly became cool, or that they introduced some new in-house items. You simply got a surge of new orders that will wild up being mostly one-time in nature. These customers will churn just like they have over the past 10 years. OSTK reported customer retention for this huge Q2 influx of new customers as being a modest 16% higher than prior quarters (see below). Decent, but nothing here to indicate any structural changes to the terrible unit economics of this business.
  Consensus now has the business doing ~$2.1B in revs in 2020 (40% growth) and then growing another 16% off that base in 2021 to generate ~$2.4B in revs. If we are very generous and assume that half of the excess $400mm ($770mm Q2 less $350mm typical quarter) in Covid revenues are recurring, that would put the new quarterly run-rate at around $550mm or $2.2B annually. We would guess that the reality is well less than 50% is actually recurring. In this case, assuming similar incremental margins to the performance in Q2, the business would earn ~$125mm of gross profits (vs. $178mm in Q2) and ~$25mm of EBITDA (vs. $53mm in Q2) quarterly, and ~$100mm EBITDA annually. More likely, very little of this excess revenue generation in Q2 will persist as we move into 2021 and the company will see very minimal long term increase in intrinsic value besides the profits in Q2. 
  At $67 per share, you a shorting the stock at 25x this favorable $100mm normalized EBITDA scenario with the share price momentum already decidedly negative. What’s a crappy no growth e-com furniture retailer worth? Maybe 7x EBITDA? That puts you at $25 per share. More likely, this was pretty much all one time and the company goes back to generating minimal profits. In that case, this stock will fully round-trip back to $5.

Gravity (ticker GRVY) is a stock with limited downside risk due to its valuation and the potential for significant appreciation (100%+) as it approaches the peak of its earnings cycle, which should occur in 2008.  Value realization could actually come well before the arrival of peak earnings as there are two activist hedge funds committed to improving the stock price.
  Gravity is trading under $6 with over $3 of net cash and peak earnings power of around $1 (could be as high as $1.50 or as low as $0.50 depending on assumptions).  Peak earnings should occur in 2008, and if they come in at $1, it’s hard to imagine the stock not trading at least at $11  (8 P/E + net cash) and it’s conceivable it could trade a lot higher. 
  In addition to the fundamentals, there is the possibility that there will be a buyout of the company’s shares in the next 6-12 months.  In August 2005, EZER, an affiliate of Softbank, purchased a 52.4% stake in Gravity from Gravity’s founder and former Chairman, Kim Jung Ryul.  EZER paid an estimated $24.70 per share, or 3.5x Gravity’s then trading price of $7.10 per share.  EZER declared in an SEC filing that it had acquired the stake in Gravity to secure a continued licensing deal for Gravity’s Ragnorak game for another Softbank affiliate, GungHo Online Entertainment (Bloomberg ticker 3765 JP).  Not only were the minority shareholders not taken out, but EZER said in the filing that they would not pay over $7.10 per share for the remaining shares outstanding, and further threatened to have the stock delisted from the NASDAQ and raised the possibility of using its voting power to force a sale of all the company’s assets  The ultimate money behind this flagrant screwing of minority shareholders is not some small cap or private Asian entity but in fact Softbank (ticker 9984 JP), a Japanese technology conglomerate with a $20+ billion market capitalization.  Softbank is run by Masayoshi Son, a prominent Japanese business leader and billionaire, the 221st richest person in the world,  and father of Taizo Son, the Chairman of GungHo Online.  Given the presence of two activists with substantial resources and a demonstrated tenacity and unwillingness to roll over, it seems unlikely the company will be stolen without a legal battle, and that a takeout below the IPO price (up 100%+) will be accepted.
  Company History and Business Model
Gravity is headquartered in South Korea but trades exclusively on the NASDAQ as an ADR.  It develops and distributes MMORPG (massively multi-player online role-playing games) throughout the world, with the primary source of revenue being East Asia.  MMORPG (think a high-tech, internet-enabled massive game of dungeons and dragons) are extremely popular in Asia, where players often spend 4 hours or more per day playing the games, and there can be tens of thousands of players competing against each other during peak hours.  The game experience is addictive, and the more time one spends playing a game, the more powers they will obtain, allowing them to advance to a higher position versus their fellow players.  The result is that the game becomes a hobby, and the time investment breeds loyalty to a particular game.  Since a majority of revenues come from monthly subscription fees, this loyalty is important because it leads to a high percentage of revenue derived from a recurring revenue source.  The more loyalty, the less churn, and the more stable the revenues.  As evidence of the level of devotion that people have to these games, it is not uncommon to see a secondary market in MMORPG powers trading on eBay.  Gravity’s primary product is the Ragnorak game, which is among the most popular in Asia.  Ragnorak really started taking off in 2003, and reached max popularity in 2004.   Capitalizing on the game’s popularity and the company’s revenue growth (300%+ in 2003 and 50%+ in 2004), Gravity was taken public by CSFB in February of 2005 at $13.50.  It has been a broken IPO from the start and quickly became an orphaned company in terms of coverage.  It has no sellside coverage; CSFB used to cover it but dropped coverage shortly after the majority interest in the company was sold in August 2005.
  The popularity of the Ragnorak game remains solid but is clearly waning as company revenues in the first half of 2006 were down 29% year-over-year in US dollars.  Like all game companies (both online and traditional packaged games), Gravity’s revenues and earnings peak following the release of new games.  There is a lot of operating leverage in the business because costs (R&D/software development, G&A, etc.) are relatively fixed regardless of where revenue levels are.  Additionally, spending ramps ahead of revenues, both for R&D and marketing, such that the company has trough profitability (and may even lose money) in the period right before a launch.  Revenues are earned through both upfront licensing fees (usually $1 million to $3 million per region depending on the size of the region) and a revenue share of subscription fees (typically 20-30%).  In all regions other than South Korea and the US, Gravity has a distribution partner who markets the game, collects and processes subscription revenues, and manages the servers and other technology required to deliver the game. 
  For Gravity, earnings and revenues peaked in 2004.  In 2004, the company made a little over $1 per share (around $30 million) and had a 60% operating margin.  In the first half of 2006 (a period of trough profitability), the company lost about $2 million, and probably would have broken even or made a little money without the one-time expenses associated with fighting the activists and litigating against the former Chairman, who was found to have embezzled money prior to selling out his share of the company (the funds were since recovered).  With a market cap of $163 million and an EV of $78 million (there is $85 million in cash), the company trades at well under 2x the peak EBITDA of $45 million achieved in 2004.  NCSoft (ticker 036570 KS), another Korean MMORPG maker, trades at well over 10x EBITDA and a 16x TTM P/E (these are probably peak earnings).  That company relies heavily on one game, Lineage, and was successfully able to migrate users profitably to its sequel, Lineage 2.  In both online and packaged games, there are many examples of sequels meeting or exceeding the profitability of their predecessor game.  Applying a 8-12 P/E on $1 and adding the cash balance yields a $11-$15 fair value range for Gravity (+88% to +156%).  Even without the presence of activists, Gravity looks like a good fundamental bet based on valuation and business cycle.
  The Activist Story
Ramius Capital and Moon Capital, hedge funds with a combined $8 billion in assets under management and a 16% combined stake in Gravity, have taken the lead in protecting minority shareholders rights.  Ramius and Moon have succeeded in organizing a minority shareholders committee.  They have pushed for the removal of executives and directors who have represented EZER at the expense of other investors and an investigation into certain related party transactions.  They have also raised public awareness about the continuing investigation and allegations of embezzlement against Kim Jung Ryul.  They have even intimated that representatives of EZER aided him in this fraud.  On December 26, 2006, a vote was taken on a proposal to remove the CEO and COO of Gravity (both EZER appointees).  The vote was obviously impossible to win, given EZER’s 52% voting majority, but the results, which were frankly outstanding, should serve to apply additional pressure on EZER and Softbank.  An astonishing 97.4% of minority shares outstanding voted to remove management.  This represented an equally remarkable total of 87% of minority shareholders.  ISS, the proxy advisory service that rarely recommends voting against management, recommended a vote against management in this instance.  Whether through the courts or through the press, this vote should give Ramius and Moon substantial leverage as they continue their fight against EZER.
  One obvious concern has been the maximization of the revenue opportunity in Japan for Ragnorak 2.  The company is currently negotiating upfront licensing fees and revenue share agreements for Ragnorak 2.  Given that the negotiations for the Japan license are with a related party, GungHo, it is safe to assume that maximum value will not be obtained in Japan, which represented about 20% of peak revenues for the first Ragnorak.  GungHo, which derives 95% of its revenues from distributing Ragnorak, currently has a market cap about twice that of Gravity’s ($332 million) and trades at 216x TTM EBITDA and a 68 P/E.  Gungho was down 83% in 2006 and around the same amount from where it traded before EZER bought its Gravity stake.  With GungHo trading at a 400 P/E with limited financial resources and a business model completely reliant on securing the Ragnorak 2 license, it is pretty clear why Softbank orchestrated the purchase of a majority stake in Gravity.  Terms to Gravity should have been much more favorable with Ragnorak 2 than Ragnorak 1 given GungHo’s prior state of desperation, but clearly given the control stake, value will not have been maximized by the recently signed Ragnorak 2 agreement (the deal terms have not been disclosed).  The independent shareholders can only hope that the terms with GungHo on Ragnorak 2 were at least close to those on Ragnorak 1, even though that means money left on the table.  Ramius and Moon are currently pressuring Gravity to release the terms of the Japan license.  Fortunately for independent shareholders, 80% of Gravity’s business has historically been with parties that remain unrelated.  In a recent conference call, management indicated that they are being tough in their negotiations with various licensees, so there is some hope that better terms in other major territories (e.g., Taiwan and Thailand) may offset what could be weaker terms in Japan.
  Outlook and Price Target
The most probable outcome to the activist initiative would be a minority share buyout at the IPO price of $13.50 (+130%).  If the activists can be enough of a gadfly to the company, the easiest path of resistance for EZER and Softbank will likely be a buyout, especially given Softbank’s deep pockets.  The maximum imaginable return is $24.70 (+320%), which is the price EZER paid for Chairman Kim Jung Ryul’s stake.
  Even if the activists fail and EZER does not buy the remaining minority shares, GRVY is still worth at least $11 (+88%) and possibly quite more on fundamentals alone, and earnings should start getting better in mid 2007 and peak in 2008.  Over $3 net cash per share on the balance sheet (or 52% of current market cap) provides a large degree of downside protection.
  Catalysts
1.      Financial results start to improve with the commercialization of Ragnorak 2 in 2007 and the company starts trading at a reasonable P/E multiple
2.      Activist hedge funds succeed through legal or PR efforts in forcing a buyout of the minority shares, likely at a premium of 100% more
  Risks
1.      Ragnorak 2 does not achieve the popularity of the original Ragnorak, or its release is delayed pushing earnings recovery into 2008 from 2007
2.      EZER attempts a take-under of the minority shares, either through a public tender or through a purchase of the bulk of the firm’s operating assets at a below market value (there are legal protections against this scenario in both US and South Korean law)

Overview 
Griffon Corp 4% converts 2023 @ 85 (15% YTP) (put to Griffon July 18, 2010).  Griffon is a mini-conglomerate with a collection of profitable businesses and more cash than debt thanks to a rights offering conducted this past summer.  Griffon has been repurchasing the converts in the open market and they are almost certainly money good.  A buyer at these prices can earn 15% a year for the next 1 ½ years until the put date, with an option on a higher IRR if the convert market continues to stabilize and these trade up sooner than the put date. 
  Capital Structure
-         60m shares outstanding
-         GFF: $8.35 – equity capitalization $500 million
-         Debt: $200m total debt includes $100m convert and $100m bank debt and cap leases
-         Cash: $285m
-         Net Cash: $85m
  Background
  Griffon had been under pressure for years to sell various divisions in order to maximize shareholder value.  The former CEO, Harvey Blau, was reluctant to break up the company and he was ultimately replaced this past year by a new CEO, Ron Kramer.  With the collapse of the capital markets and the subsequent decline in asset values, the opportunity to sell the company in pieces was closed.  Instead, the company announced a substantial equity raise via a $246m rights offering backstopped by Goldman Sachs.  While the company was relatively tight-lipped about the purpose of the offering, it seemed at the time that they were perhaps looking ahead a couple of years at the put date on the convert and wanted to avoid a difficult refinancing.  The official line is that they were raising money for “general corporate purposes” and with Goldman as their new largest shareholder would be open to creating a new business line via acquisition.   However, management has recently reiterated that cash is king and they are focused on managing the convert issue, meaning that they are unlikely to use their existing cash hoard to make a significant purchase. 
  While the rights offering was dilutive (and upsetting) to existing shareholders, it should be highly reassuring to the convertible bond holders.   This issue, like many other converts, has been sold indiscriminately by funds forced to liquidate their convert positions.  Griffon management has been eager to take advantage of the bond discount; on the fourth quarter (Sept 30 FY) conference call, the company announced that it had repurchased $35.5m bonds at 80 in the open market and would consider additional bond repurchases. 
  Business Segments
  In aggregate, the collection of businesses at Griffon continues to hold up reasonably well.  Griffon generated $24m of EBITDA in Q4 and $68m EBITDA on the year.  This past fiscal year, the company generated $85m in CFOP against $53m in CAPX and Kramer has suggested that CAPX will be lowered to between $30m and $40m in 2009.
   The most valuable segment at Griffon is their “Telephonics” business -- a defense electronics subcontractor.  It generated $39.5m in 2008 segment EBITDA (before allocated G&A) and is enjoying rapid organic growth.  The segment appears to have declined from the previous year, but that is because of the conclusion of a very large short-term contract to supply anti-IED devices to the military in Iraq.  The core of the business consists of a host of radar, surveillance and communications systems that equip a range of airplanes and helicopters.  Excluding the impact of the anti-IED contract, the core business grew 31% in Q4. 
  The second most important segment is the “plastic film business” which primarily consists of manufacturing diaper backs.  This segment generated $43.3m in EBITDA (before allocated G&A) up 13% from the previous year.  The diaper back business is a relatively steady if unspectacular one; there is large customer concentration, but only one real competitor (Tredegar) and they have multi-year contracts with lagged commodity pass-through provisions. 
  The third segment is the Clopay brand “Garage Door” segment; it generated segment EBITDA of $10.1m this past year, down approximately 50% from the previous year.  This business is obviously getting crushed in the current environment, but management has begun to reduce fixed costs and will benefit from the rapid decline in steel input costs.  It operated at an EBIT loss in the most recent quarter and it’s tough to expect anything other than losses at the current production rate for the next couple of years. 
  Griffon previously had a fourth operating segment “Installation Services” which contracted to install garage doors, kitchen cabinets, etc.  This was never a good business and lost a horrific amount of money over the past two years until they closed it down this past summer.  There are relatively minor additional cash costs (less than $10m) required to fully shut this segment. 
  Conclusion
  Even in this economic environment, the business continues to generate substantial cash flow.   Between the significant net cash position, the real value of its various cash flow positive businesses and Goldman as its largest shareholder (to guard against poor uses of cash), it is extremely unlikely that Griffon won’t be able to take out the converts in July 2010
  Risks
  The main risk is that the company spends its cash reserves on a new division. Mitigated by the fact that they are well aware of the impending bond put and Goldman is unlikely to allow the company to put itself in a position where it cannot take out the debt issue.

Overview
After receiving a $181mm legal settlement from the federal government in 2012, and paying a $2/sh special dividend in Dec 2012, ABCP now holds nearly $2/sh in cash net of liabilities, has a minimal burn rate, but currently trades at only $1.05. An investor could realize substantial gains with minimal risk, even if ABCP only trades up to a more modest discount to cash.
Background of Lawsuit and Settlement with Government
Although it does not matter much at this point, it’s worth briefly mentioning the “supervisory goodwill” settlement that ABCP reached with the US Government. In 1988, AmBase purchased Carteret Bancorp. At that time, Carteret had roughly $180mm in “supervisory goodwill.” Goodwill is an intangible asset that could normally not be considered as part of a bank’s regulatory assets, but at that time, Congress allowed acquired goodwill to be counted as part of a bank’s regulatory assets in order to incentivize stronger banks to acquire weaker ones.
The following year, in 1989, the law was changed so that supervisory goodwill could no longer be counted as a regulatory asset. As a result, Carteret was way out of compliance with capital requirements; it tried to regain compliance, but the bank was ultimately seized by OTS in 1992.
In 1993, Carteret (along with many other financial institutions that were similarly affected) sued the federal government for the damages it sustained as a result of the change in the treatment of goodwill towards capital requirements.
The case was not resolved for many years. In August 2011 the Federal Court of Claims awarded $205mm in damages to Ambase; the government then appealed this ruling, and finally, in August 2012, the parties reached a settlement whereby the government agreed to pay AmBase $180.65mm. As part of the settlement, the government will also pay any federal taxes that might be imposed on the settlement amount (the “tax gross-up”)..
As part of his 2007 Employment Agreement, Ambase’s CEO stood to receive a potentially large bonus based on how much AmBase recovered. The settlement turned potential into reality and the CEO is now entitled to $13.6mm, leaving AmBase with a net of $167mm in cash from the settlement.
Finally, AmBase paid out part of the money received in the settlement agreement by paying out a $2/sh special dividend in December 2012.
Current Financials and the Discount to Cash
Summary financials of AmBase based on 9/30/12 balance sheet and giving effect to the $2 Special Dividend: 
Sharecount(mm) 43.755
    9/30 Cash and Investments 5.199
Settlement Amount 180.65
Subtotal 187.73
    Less:  
9/30 Liabilities (0.2)
Payment to CEO (13.6)
$2 Dividend (87.51)
    Cash (mm) 86.42
Cash per Share $1.98
  (Real Estate: I’ve neglected this in the above cash value analysis, but Ambase also owns a 14,500 sq ft office building in Greenwich, CT. The building was purchased by Ambase for $2.4mm in 2001; it is now booked at $1.9mm. I’m assuming the building is likely worth substantially more than what they paid for it 12 years ago. With a 43mm share count, the gain on the building would likely not move the needle by a huge amount, but could be material.)
There are a few reasons that ABCP is (and should) trade at a discount to cash, but I think there is one reason that ABCP is currently trading at such large discount on a % basis. I’ve seen this effect in companies making liquidating distributions that are large relative to the stock price, and I see it in ABCP now. The effect is that, when a company that is trading below cash makes a large distribution relative to the stock price, the price of the stock needs to go up (sometimes by a lot) in order to keep the same % discount. I just think that ABCP has not fully adjusted yet.
If you look at ABCP’s chart, you can see that after the settlement, but before the Special Dividend, ABCP was trading at roughly $3/sh. Based on $3.98/sh pre-dividend cash, that is roughly 75% of cash. I think this is a fair valuation based on the fact that the ownership is concentrated in the Bianco family, and that ABCP has no real sources of upside (the office building is the exception, but just assume for now that any gain on the building offsets future overhead expense). If you run screens looking for this sort of thing, you should be able to find some similar situations, where the stock trades at about ¾ of cash. My experience generally backs this up.
But now ABCP pays out $2 as a special dividend. What was a $3 stock with $3.98/sh in cash is now a $1 stock with $1.98/sh in cash. And what was a stock trading at 75% of cash, is now trading at 50% of cash. 75% of cash seems about right, but 50% of cash is too cheap. If ABCP once again trades at 75% of cash, then that gets you to $1.49, which gets you a 42% return from $1.05. And I don’t think there is much risk, because after all, you are buying a stock that is trading at 50% of cash. Plus, you have the office building in Greenwich as a kicker.
Risks
I think the risks are largely offset by the discount, but the main risk is management. The Bianco family run the company and they own roughly 40% of the stock. CEO Ralph Bianco got himself a sweet deal that netted him a $13.6mm bonus as a result of the legal settlement, even though the lawyers must have done just about all the work.
But, even with this, I believe that 50% of cash is just too cheap, and that now the dividend has been paid, I think the stock price should re-adjust to about 75% of cash, i.e., the same discount it was trading at before the dividend.
I do not hold a position of employment, directorship, or consultancy with the issuer.

  I think Harley Davidson is a compelling long opportunity and should trade at $35 in the next 12 months and potentially $50 longer-term, as the short term pain from prior management’s missteps and the new CEO’s move to streamline costs and rationalize the dealer base (lower shipment volumes) should pave the way for a turnaround heading into 2021/2022. To be clear, this is not a business benefitting from the surge in outdoor sports.  This is a complete reset and it will take multiple quarters to truly measure the impact of the new turnaround strategy. In fact, their business is currently really ugly, with retail volumes down 27% in the second quarter, while peers such as Polaris saw a 20% increase.  But this is not a fair representation of the franchise as some of the pressure was self-inflicted while some was Covid related.  Despite secular pressure from lower motorcycle ownership, Harley is still an iconic American brand that has been mismanaged and has lost share to smaller, upstart brands. However, the new German-born CEO, who was hired in February and had previously resurrected the Puma brand from the ashes, is reversing the prior CEOs strategy, with a new focus on streamlining the business and more importantly creating scarcity value around the brand.  He also believes the secular decline thesis is overstated, and while current riders continue to age, a new generation of riders will “age into” to core riding demographic.  Also, a broader population shift from cities to more rural communities should support riding trends on the margin.  The previous failed strategy was purely volume focused, which in the face of competition and secular pressure, hurt resale pricing, the brand and ultimately retail sales.  Lastly, bike sales previously peaked in 2006 so a large percentage of the installed base is reaching scrappage age, which should further support used pricing and new retail sales. 
  This crux of an investment in HOG is 2-fold.  First, you must believe in the value of the Harley Davidson brand as an American iconic status symbol.  Second, you need to believe that the new CEO has the chops to execute a turnaround in the face of ongoing secular headwinds.  Management is rationalizing the business to refocus on its strengths, which I believe makes sense.  On the most recent earnings call, Management laid out their plan to fix prior issues (lower costs, reduce inventory, maintain supply/demand balance) and stem the losses.  Later this year, the Company will announce its 5-year plan, which will present their plan to grow the business. 
  While there is some complexity around valuation (Financial Services segment “HDFS”), the core motorcycle manufacturing bike business “HDMC” is trading at an attractive implied valuation.  Assuming the Financial Services segment can be valued at 10x normalized earnings, the core Bike franchise is trading at sub-7x 2021 EBITDA and 5.5x 2022 EBITDA.  This assumes that Management is able to improve margins to 2019 levels, however, sales remain well below.  Given the magnitude of the cost cutting targets, the margins improvement appears reasonable.  A $35 stock price would value the core bike business at 8x EBITDA.  Assuming the company restores the dividend to prior levels (something free cash flow should support) would result in a 5+% dividend yield.  Should Management be successful in their turnaround efforts, I believe this forecast could ultimately prove conservative and you could see further upside in the stock. 
  From an investment perspective, I don’t think it will take much for the market to price in a turnaround.  Management has guided to further weakness from a sales perspective, but margins and pricing should respond to the current aggressive actions being taken.   If the Company can put up a decent quarter showing any real progress/traction, the stock is likely to price in the turnaround.  There is also an activist poking around that I believe could accelerate changes, and at a minimum, give a boost to the stock. 
         What is the long-term upside to Harley if turnaround is successful?
  I think under reasonable assumptions, mostly driven by cost discipline, the Company can earn somewhere around $2.40 per share for next year.  If they are successful on the demand side – driving mid-single digit volume growth, than the business can earn upwards of $4 over the next 4-5 years.   For much of the last decade, HOG generated mid-teen operating margins on its bike business.  This dropped to 6.3% in 2019, with tariffs and manufacturing inefficiencies adding to their problems.   Assuming the Company can get back to a 10% operating margin by 2023 (driven by modest volume growth from depressed 2020 levels and cost savings and still well below their avg over the last decade), HOG could earn around $3.25 in 2023.  At a 15x multiple, the stock would trade at roughly $50.  
  The following summarizes the key drivers of the Harley Davidson turnaround opportunity:
  -          Leadership change with fresh vision and proven record (new CEO who turned around Puma)
  -          Plan to drive scarcity value back into iconic motorcycle brand – slashing inventory, reducing number of models, exiting underperforming markets and rationalizing dealers
  -          Expectations for better used bike values; boosting rider currency for trade-ins – used prices already up this year and prior peak sales (2006) now entering scrappage phase
  -          Easy 2021 wholesale growth after aggressive 2020 inventory reduction, covid drop and six straight years of declines
  -          Formal acknowledgement of the need for “more credible expectations” – management has lowered the bar.  Cost cuts alone should drive meaningful margin expansion.
  -          Potential for ESG investors to embrace CEO and his sustainability vision
      The new strategy is focused on:
  -          Reducing cost structure and operational complexity - 700 jobs eliminated;
  -          Cutting dealer inventory and bike lineup - 30% sku reduction;
  -          Focusing on higher margin aftermarket, accessories and general merchandise;
  -          Exiting low-ROI international markets - focus on 50 key markets in North America, Europe and parts of APAC;
  -          Shrinking dealer footprint ~50 dealers worldwide could be shut down; and
  -          Focusing on supporting strong brand and driving scarcity value via reduced supply
      Early Signs of Success:
  -          2020 new bikes are selling at MSRP on average
  -          Used bike prices up 6% in Q2
  -          Dealer inventory levels down 32%
  -          250mm in cash savings from SG&A and capex reductions for 2020
    Are there any examples of successful turn-arounds that involve reducing volume and increasing prices?
  Hard to find great examples that compare.  Ferrari is probably the strategy most comparable, where the company has limited supply to create scarcity value.  Harley is obviously at a much lower price point.  We’ve seen a number of turnarounds in retail/apparel.  Lacoste, Converse, Puma were all next to dead before using a more premium strategy to elevate the brands.  I would argue that Harley is more of an operational turnaround than a brand turnaround. The Harley Davidson brand is still very strong but has been mismanaged.  It is an iconic brand in the motorcycle space and I don’t think much has changed around that.  The prior management team chose to push volumes at the expense of profitability, which has had longer term impact thru used bike prices.  This created somewhat of a downward spiral (dog chasing tail) and requires some pain to fix.  2020 appears to be that pain point where management is slashing inventories, cutting underperforming dealers and getting out of certain international markets. Prior management also misread the market, choosing to maintain their focus on the large, heavy duty bikes and not putting out smaller models.  While the Company is going to reduce overall models, they will broaden their portfolio to cover more of the market. 
I think the best way to judge the progress is thru pricing – both new bike sales compared to MSRP and used bike sales compared to prior years.  On their Q2 call, Management noted inventories were down 32%, new bikes were selling at MSRP and used bike prices were up 6%yoy.
With easy comps for 2021 and a significant right-sizing of the cost structure, Management should be able to exceed what are now lowered expectations.  The potential for a more meaningful turnaround provides a call option for far more upside over the long term. 
    Key risk: The biggest risk remains demand and competition.

  Suitable for small funds or PAs.
  Bravo Brio Restaurant Group (BBRG) was presented by SlackTide on March 10, 2017, so this will be brief.  I don’t love the idea of re-submissions only eight months later, so I won’t count this toward my annual quota.  But I think there are some nuances to point out, and that it’s timely to revisit this microcap. For this write-up, I will not address the quasi-activism by TAC Capital, nor the company's February 2017 announcement that it would ""explore alternatives to enhance shareholder value"" as I have never viewed either of them as material considerations.
  Since BBRG was posted on VIC in March, the company has reported three quarters of results.  While SSS remain weak (down 2.9% YTD), EBITDA has increased by 24% YTD. The thesis is that a baseline for EBITDA has been set, and with the stock down 39% this year, it is too cheap at 3.7x LTM EBITDA and 5x FCFE.
  BBRG pursued an aggressive/foolish leasing strategy during its growth phase, whereby it accepted lease incentives in the form of large upfront cash payments. So BBRG signed many leases where the trade-off for an upfront cash rebate were payments over the life of the lease that are above the industry average, as a % of sales. Essentially, they pulled-forward cash out of their lease arrangements, as a form of financing. The cash proceeds were then re-invested into new locations, most of which are in malls.  The abnormally high ongoing lease expense has been exacerbated by the company’s decline in sales.  Further, this negative working capital cycle created by this strategy is now unwinding, as the company is no longer signing new leases and thus not receiving upfront cash. Finally, even accounting for the cash rebates, the company signed several leases that were too expensive for their revenue base over the last few years. It was a bad combination of aggressive financing arrangements and just plain bad lease deals. Notably, the CEO who led this charge left the company at the end of 2015.
  As the accounting works, the amortization of these lease incentives is deducted from the Occupany expense on income statement, however it remains a cash outflow – this is now inflating the company’s reported “income statement” EBITDA. I have made adjustments to account for this lease incentive amortization with all of my references to EBITDA so that it reflects the true cash economics of the business.  I felt this was fully understood and discounted at under $4 per share, but apparently not.
  With this piper now being paid, BBRG shares have become unusually cheap to this Adjusted EBITDA. Several years of declining SSS and EBITDA are the culprit, however EBITDA has turned demonstrably of late. LTM EBITDA is now 16% ahead of 2016; YTD EBITDA is up 24% versus 2016; and 2Q + 3Q 2017 EBITDA is double what it was for the same quarters of 2016. Despite revenue declines, I believe there is more margin improvement to be had.  The table below lays out the numbers, in comparison to the three best comparable companies in my judgement.  They’re not perfect, but they illustrate the delta in margins.
  Note that I adjust EBITDA for the “lease incentive” portion that is amortized (and deducted) from the expense item on the income statement.  Therefore my Adjusted EBITDA is lower than what would appear in company screens.
    As shown above, BBRG’s margins are improving but remain too low:
  Food costs are line with its peers, and this is good news.  While they are certainly price-takers, they’re not in purgatory with regard to this line time
Labor/Operating/G&A expense has improved some, but I believe there is more to follow.  It remains too high
They have several bad leases and cash flow-negative stores from which they are exiting.  So far, they have exited 5 stores this year, and I expect 5 or so additional closures next year.  Finally, I believe there are selective opportunities for price concessions where leases that are up for renewal imminently (say 1-2 years out).  Many of the malls they are in are even more price-takers than is BBRG
  I think item 2 above will continue to show modest improvement. And while there is not much they can do about most of their leases (they are stuck with above-market rent in most places), there will be marginal improvement there as a % of revenue. For comparison’s sake, below is comp table – I added KONA for another perspective, namely because it is also a microcap with debt.  And for comic relief.
      There is not a lot to like about this group, and BBRG in particular.  BBRG has suffered a horrendous multi-year slide in SSS (-5.2%, -2.8%, -5.0%, -2.8% from 2016 back to 2013), and one must go back to 2012 to hit flat/positive comp sales.  In addition, the company recently required a waiver to their bank agreement, after threatening to trip a lease-adjusted leverage ratio – the lease capitalization pushed over what was a tight convenant, and it seems clear the banks want out of this one. One of the concessions was to move up the maturity from November 2019 to December 1, 2018.  I have low concern over the company’s ability to work out a new financing arrangement, likely with cash flow sweeps, which I expect in weeks to two months.
  Next, the CFO departed for personal reasons in September (I am satisfied with what I have been told regarding this).  Finally, one of the few analysts still following the company, from Piper Jaffray, downgraded the stock upon the CFO announcement.  To the positive, the company filled the role within a month, luring back a BBRG veteran (ten years as VP-Finance / Accounting) who had recently left the company.
  From the announcement of the beginning of the bank waiver discussions until now, the stock has been cut in half.  In between, they have reported two quarters that have reinforced my thesis.  I project that BBRG can achieve a 6% Adjusted EBITDA margin run-rate, on a sales base of $380M (pro forma for restaurant closures) by mid-2018.  This generates EBITDA of $23M and free cash flow to the equity of $9M, representing 3.1x EBITDA and a 25% FCFE yield.  This assumes an annual capex budget of $8M, which includes maintenance; continuation of their ongoing refurbishment program; and zero new stores.  This also assumes continued negative 2-3% comps for another year, followed by a leveling-off toward flat.  Remember, some negative-margin stores have been cut, with those benefits to be seen over coming quarters.   In addition, there is still room for expense improvement for the better locations, and the company has shown modest gains there over the last two quarters.  So coming from such a low base, there is still room to push margins upward.  I think the shares are too cheap to ignore.

TDS is a wireless company that is not only poorly valued as an operating concern, but also trades at a discount to its stock portfolio.

First, they are outperforming their wireless industry. TDS has a 5 year average pretax margin of 15% that is triple the 5 year industry average and their current net margin is 12.5% vs. the industry average of -2.4%. TDS' debt to equity is half the industry's 1.26 and last year's ROA of 4.8% (double their own 5 year average) compares favorably with the industry average of -14.2%. None of this is expected to change for the worse.

Despite these superior results, TDS trades at levels significantly lower than its competitors. The industry averages 15x book value, TDS 2.5x. TDS currently is at 3x sales while the industry average is 10x. Conservatively, if TDS was trading at 10x book, they would be priced at $400/share. If 7x sales, TDS would be valued at $220/share. Both significantly above current levels.

Besides the low valuations given to TDS based just on operations, TDS is intrinsically undervalued. As of April 25, TDS was trading at a 12% discount to their stock portfolio of 70.79 million shares of USM (81% control), 78.18 million shares of AERL (which converts to 35.57 million shares of VSTR when VSTR consummates merger with AERL) and 2.7 million shares of VOD.

If the share holdings were disposed of, through the spin off of USM and sale of the VSTR and VOD holdings, the remaining operations, at 7x sales would be worth 62 dollars per share, without the cash from the disposition of VOD and the VSTR holdings.

If TDS were to dispose of their holdings today $157 would be a fair price: $62 dollars per share for the standalone company, $35 in cash (after tax) from a VSTR/VOD sale and $60 in USM stock from a spin off.

With institutional ownership at almost 70%, there are plenty of powerful and vocal shareholders who are pushing management for maximizing shareholder value, most likely for a spin off of the valuable stake in USM.

National Research Corporation (NRC) was founded in 1981 and has been public since 1997 with headquarters in Lincoln, Nebraska. NRC develops tools that enable healthcare organizations (primarily hospitals) to obtain performance measurement information necessary to comply with industry and regulatory standards and to improve their business practices so that they can maximize resident/patient attraction, experience, retention, and the organization’s profitability. Significant portion of their business is subscriptions based.
Company generated $86mn in revenues in 2012 with gross margins of 59% and EBIT margins of 26%.  To put things into perspective, company generated $44mn of revenues in 2006 with gross margins of 56% and EBIT margins of 23%.  Company generates ~$20MM in operating cash, has minimal capex needs, resulting in ROIC of over 20%.  Company has consistently paid out a dividend since 2005 and in 2012, company paid out regular dividends of $7mn + $10mn special dividend distribution. 
As of May 22nd, the company had 7mn shares outstanding with a price of $60, resulting in a marked cap of ~$420mn.  CEO, Michael Hays, owned 54% of the company.  On May 23rd, the company went through a recap program (announced in March by company and approved by Board in beginning of May) which resulted in the creation of two new share classes, A & B.  Existing shareholders would receive 3 A shares and 1/2 B shares.  Most importantly, shareholders of A&B classes have the same right and rank equally except for rights to votes and dividends:
-          A shareholders are entitled to 1/100th of a vote per share and 1/6th of any dividends distributed
-          B shareholders are entitled to 1 vote per share and 6x of any dividends distributed
Dividends were also suspended in “order to try to insulate the volume and trading price of the Class A Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock from significant fluctuations resulting from the Recapitalization until a sufficient and independent trading market was established for each of the Class A Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock” (per company filings).
As a result of the recap program, 21mn of A shares and 3.5mn of B shares were created.  Using the pre-recap market cap of $420mn as the basis, the market cap for NRCI-A and NRCI-B should be $210mn each post-recap.  Applying these market caps and taking the new share count for each share class, A shares should be trading at $10 (210/21) and B shares should be trading at $60 (210/3.5).  A shares are currently trading at $18 per share and B shares are trading at $40 per share.  Clearly, there is a mispricing between the current market price of A & B shares and where they should be actually trading based on the recap.  Given the difference in share count between A and B shares, the stock price ratio should be 1 to 6.  B shares should actually trade at a premium to 6:1 given the voting rights it controls.   Part of the mispricing occurs because shares are fairly illiquid.  Average trading volume for A shares is ~15k per day while for B shares it is ~9k per day.
An important part of this analysis is to understand the reasoning of the recap as well as CEO incentives as he controls 54% of the company.  Per the company’s filings, rationale for recap is to “improve liquidity and expand institutional ownership base, maintain voting continuity while increasing shareholder flexibility, minimize voting and dividend dilution to existing holders on future equity issuance.”  While at face value this might look like a legitimate reason, the whole purpose of the recap is to provide a liquidity vehicle for the CEO while maintaining control of the company. If we do the math, any existing shareholders before the recap would have the following breakdown from their A/B share distributions:
-          A’s would control 85.7% of the sharecount while Bs would have 14.3%
-          A would have 6% of the voting while Bs would have 94% of the voting
-          Dividends would be split 50/50 between A & B (6x B vs. A on a per share basis)
Hence, after the recap, existing shareholders could sell all of their A shares, liquidating 85.7% of their holdings, but would retain 94% of their voting control and still retaining 50% of their dividend distributions.  Looking at the filings, the CEO has transferred large blocks of A shares to personal trusts set up for his family.  To the extent the CEO or trust sells all of their shares, the CEO would still maintain at least 50% of the company (this is how they arrived at the initial 1:6 ratio share count and 1:100).  The 50% ownership is a minimum threshold the CEO needs to maintain in order to have ""unilateral ability to elect all of the directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted for a vote.""  
  Another key to this investment thesis is the reinstatement of dividend distributions as B shares would receive 6x the amount of dividends on a per share basis relative to A shares.  Looking again at the alignment of interest between the CEO and minority shareholders, I believe the CEO will reinstate dividends.  On a previous proposal submitted which was voted down by the board, the CEO had initially asked for the board to approve a recap program where A shares would receive 1/100th in voting rights AND dividends.  Clearly, the only reason for this proposal would be to benefit distributions to B shareholders.  Furthermore, looking at the compensation of Hays, his base salary in 2012 was $127,400 with total compensation of $304,704 (includes options, incentive plan comp, and other).  The bulk of his comp came from dividend distributions. Again, taking $7.1mn in regular dividends distributed in 2012, and CEO having 54% ownership results in over $3.8mn of comp coming from regular dividend distributions.  Thus the bulk of his income comes from dividends and not his base + stock comp.  I highly doubt any CEO would be content going from receiving between $1.5-3.8mn as part of his annual comp (dividends allocated to CEO between 2006-2012) to $0.

Winmill may trade at an even bigger discount to intrinsic value than when Charlie479 wrote it up six years ago (even though stock has tripled). Winmill trades below net cash and investments, yet it has a nice little operating business running the Midas gold mutual fund (rated five stars by Morningstar for three-year performance). At the current absurd valuation, Winmill has minimal downside coupled with large upside.
Biggest drawback of this idea: It’s tiny (sorry).
  Background
  The 2001 write-up by Charlie479 and the associated message board provide a good overview of the Winmill thesis and the concerns that have kept investors away. I highly recommend the write-up and the message board discussion.
  There have been three major developments since Charlie479’s write-up: (1) Winmill’s share price has increased from $1.70 to $5.00; (2) Winmill’s net cash and investments have increased from $3.91 to $5.06 per share, thanks primarily to the successful sale of a major investment by Bexil Corp. (AMEX: BXL), a Winmill affiliate; and, most importantly, (3) Winmill is no longer just a “cigar butt,” but has a rapidly growing, well performing gold investment business that could serve as the catalyst for a major revaluation of the shares.
  Note that the current net cash of $5.06 per share is a conservative figure, as it is based, among other items, on the tax-effected market value of Winmill’s 222,644 shares of cash shell Bexil on September 30, 3006. Bexil shares have appreciated from $26.12 per share on September 29, 2006 to $32.00 per share on May 17, 2007. In addition, Bexil trades at a discount to net cash, i.e., Winmill has meaningfully more “look-through” net cash and investments than the $5.06 per-share figure suggests.

        What is Midas Fund Worth?
  The value of the Midas Fund business is in the eye of the beholder, and many VIC members know a lot better than I do how to value a fast-growing, strong-performing fund management business. Here is what I believe should be taken into account when valuing the business:
Negative: Management has to date not fully capitalized on the growth potential of Midas, and this may continue. While management and directors own approximately one-third of WNMLA and have a strong incentive to “maximize the value” of the business, there is a real risk this may not happen.
Positive: Owning the Midas Fund business provides exposure to gold without paying for the commodity itself. With the dollar at risk of further depreciation, it’s nice to own a hedge without really paying for it.
Positive: Impressive AUM growth, driven by strong performance versus the Category.
Positive: Improving Morningstar rating, including highly marketable three-year rating of five stars.
Positive: Room for improvement of Morningstar’s overall rating (currently three stars): If Winmill simply lowered the Midas Fund’s total expense ratio of 1.96% to the Category average of 1.56%, the Morningstar rating might improve.
Positive: Room for improvement on marketing front: As far as I can tell, Midas Fund’s asset growth has been driven primarily by the strong performance versus the Category rather than by good marketing. Winmill could become much better at growing the Midas Fund’s asset base.
  What Winmill Could Do To Maximize Value
  In order to turn WNMLA into a GROW-like story, management should pursue one of the following three courses of action:
1)      Divest ancillary assets, move WNMLA back to the Nasdaq, lower the expense ratio of the Midas Fund, and become more aggressive on the marketing front; or
2)      Spin off the Midas fund management business in a way that highlights the value of the business; or
3)      Sell the Midas fund management business to an entity that can better capitalize on the substantial growth opportunity.
  Key Risks
Insider control. While the Class A shares (WNMLA) account for virtually all of the economics of Winmill & Co., the Class A shares are non-voting, with all voting power vested in insiders.
Form 15 company. While Winmill appears committed to providing quarterly financial statements and audited annual financials along with detailed footnotes, the company has not been a filer of periodic reports with the SEC since 2004.
  Catalysts
Value

In Crompton Corp (CK) you have the opportunity to be a participant in a turnaround that appears reasonably conservative in its goals, and one that should result in significant share appreciation. While CK trades at a discount to its peers already, the potential exists for accelerating earnings through price actions, cost reductions, and further divestitures / restructurings. One can win in two ways: multiple expansion as the overhangs (especially litigation) dissipate, and fundamental business improvements.

(To be up front, I wish I had posted this a little bit earlier - I started putting this on below $6 but it's raced higher in the last 3 weeks...)

CK manufactures and markets specialty chemicals, polymers, and polymer processing equipment. The company is a leader in a number of its markets; for instance, it is the top player worldwide in castable urethane polymers, PVC additives, and miticides, amongst others. In recent years, however, CK – the entity remaining after the 1999 merger of Crompton & Knowles and Witco – has squandered these leadership positions and obscured the value proposition in a number of its products by chasing market share in a downturn at the expense of pricing. The resultant pressure on margins was only the start of the company’s problems, as it also (ironically) became subject to US Department of Justice, Canadian Commissioner of Competition and Attorney General of Canada, and European Commission investigations into alleged price-fixing of certain chemicals during the 1995-2001 period. As a result of these overhangs, CK has and continues to trade at a discount to its peer group (on EV/EBITDA...P/E is a bit skewed by new debt deal discussed below). Specifically, CK today is at 5.6x 2005 EV/EBITDA and 16.3x 2005 EPS; its peers FOE, GLK, and POL trade on average at 7.0x 2005 EV/EBITDA and 15.1x 2005 EPS.

Enter Robert Wood. In January 2004, CK announced that it had named Wood, who had most recently served as the business group president of Thermosets and Dow Automotive at Dow Chemical, as the President and CEO of the company. Since his arrival, CK has laid the groundwork for a strategic transformation, beginning the process of improving prices, reducing costs, realigning the portfolio, strengthening the balance sheet, and other measures designed to enhance shareholder value.

My price target is $10, suggesting upside of >35%, with the potential to be much higher depending on progress on various initiatives (see below for scenarios and valuation).

Pros

1. Expectations for CK’s potential are relatively low even though it is making progress.
In July 2003, the Company announced a cost reduction program targeting $40mm of annual pre-tax savings in 2004, which was expected to reduce its global workforce by approximately 375 positions. While $23.4mm has been achieved thus far in 2004, management anticipates $50mm in savings this year from that plan. This followed a successful $60mm cost reduction initiative announced in 2001 and a plan to relocate its corporate headquarters (now complete). With the arrival of the new management team, CK announced that it was implementing an activity-based restructuring initiative that would result in another $50mm in savings in 2005. For this program, the company expects to incur one-time charges not exceeding $50mm, mostly in Q3.
Notwithstanding these results, sell-side analysts are mixed, with only one recommending the stock as a buy and the other three – with no published price targets – rating CK a neutral. Consensus appears to be that CK cannot combat raw material prices and that it still has substantial legal exposure, and the new management team seems to be receiving little credit.

2. Leadership position gives CK some leverage with pricing.
As mentioned above, CK is the top player worldwide in castable urethane polymers, PVC additives, and miticides. It is also the world leader in urethanes and extrusion equipment, a top three EPDM manufacturer in North America, and the third-largest manufacturer globally of rubber chemicals. In a number of these product lines, CK’s specialty chemicals are high value-added materials, and one of the new management team’s priorities is to capture the value of their products to customers with more rational pricing. Thus far in 2004, the company has implemented $80mm in price increases, and plans to have recouped increases in raw materials by year-end (which at the end of Q2 represented a $90mm price increase…management has suggested recently that they will surpass that amount and will be higher on a run-rate basis). This performance corroborates management’s assertion that it can recapture its position as an industry price leader, which it was as it drove prices down over the previous three years.

According to the CEO, a 5% price increase would lead to $120mm in EBITDA.

3. Fresh management team highly motivated to make this work.
Robert Wood, Karen Osar, and Myles Odaniell are all new faces charged with turning CK around. In the case of Wood, he was brought in to replace long-time chairman/president/CEO Vincent Calarco – who served in that position for 19 years – and in a sense is viewed by many as CK’s (potential) savior. His reputation is clearly dependent on the success of CK’s plans, and he has been clear in saying that credibility is awfully important for this team. Management is also financially motivated to improve the share price

4. Fix/divest program will focus the company.
An early transaction was the April 2003 sale of its OrganoSilicones business unit to GE, in return for GE’s Specialty Chemicals business and cash proceeds of $633.4mm (including proceeds from its first quarterly earn-out payment of $8.75mm less transaction-related fees of $18.4mm). The deal also gives CK the opportunity to receive quarterly earn-out payments through September 2006 based on the combined performance of the two businesses; the minimum payout will total $105mm and the maximum will be $250mm (the minimum was recorded on a PV basis as a receivable on the date of the transaction).
Management has further identified Rubber Additives, Refined Products, and Polymer Processing Equipment as candidates for a fix/divest program (Equipment being an almost guaranteed divestiture, perhaps for $100-150mm according to management). EPDM was also in this category but the fixes implemented thus far seem to be working.

Concerns

1. We can’t predict everything, such as the results of the EC investigation and civil suits.
The EC investigation and suits are discussed in more detail below, and while we (and management) expect the results of these to manageable, there is no way to handicap outcomes with high certainty at this point. CK expects that the EC will resolve their anti-trust investigation by early 2005, and assuming precedent holds, the penalty will likely be similar to what the US DOJ imposed ($50mm fine). As in the US and Canada, management has been cooperative with the investigation and has also taken firm internal actions to rectify their problems. Civil suits are even more difficult to predict, but we do know two things: prices were generally falling during the period in question (making damages harder to prove); and, the company intends to litigate cases in situations where settlements would be more expensive.
Other unknowns include the path of raw material prices, discussed more below.

2. How much more cost is there to cut?
While management is confident that it will easily achieve the cost savings in its new $50mm program, and even suggests there is upside in that number, one must wonder why these cost cuts were not implemented in previous programs, i.e. how could so much fat remain after initiatives that started in 2001?

3. New debt deal was relatively expensive.
On 8/3/2004, CK priced $375mm of 9 7/8% Senior Notes due 2012 and $225mm floating rate notes due 2010 (LIBOR + 575bps). It also subsequently refinanced its credit facility with a new five-year $120mm revolver and a $100mm letter of credit facility, in addition to extending its domestic accounts receivable program. With the funds from the notes the company tendered for or redeemed its 8.50% 2005 Senior Notes ($350mm) and its 6.125% 2006 Senior Notes ($150mm). Although Deutsche Bank has reportedly trimmed the rate on the facility to 300bps over LIBOR from 350bps, the company will see its annual interest expense increase by approximately $15mm. This clearly represents the market’s judgment as to the inherent legal risk at CK as well as the price paid for extending maturities out past the end of the decade.

4. Exposure to raw materials is a difficult battle.
Even though management is in the process of increasing prices to account for cost increases to date, they are limited in their ability to respond to higher raw materials prices. The company does do some hedging – for natural gas, tin, and soybean oil – but it is also subject to the volatility in the prices of petrochemical feedstocks.

Notwithstanding all of these, I calculate downside of ~$3, and upside of $20.

Scenario Analysis

Assumptions

LTM EBITDA $185.2 (includes $70mm of price increases already achieved)

Scenarios

Bear: CK fails to raise prices further; only achieves 75% of current cost initiative; steady-state raw materials prices; $100mm penalty from EC and suits

Base: CK achieves 2004 goal of over $90mm run-rate in price increases; achieves full cost savings in current plan; raw materials & energy decrease by 5%; $50mm penalty from EC

Bull: CK achieves 5% price increase, thus adding $50mm in EBITDA; achieves full cost savings in current plan plus additional point of margin from systems integration; raw materials & energy decrease by 10%; $50mm penalty from EC

NO ASSUMPTION OF ASSET SALES; NO DEBT PAYDOWN WITH CASH; HAVE ADDED PV of NOLs (instead of shielding net income)

2020-02-14,broncos727,CMCT,CIM COMMERICAL TRUST,https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/CIM_COMMERICAL_TRUST/7152625844,220000000.0,15.07,"Description
We wrote up the thinly traded REIT CMCT one year ago as a return of capital “trade” idea led by a motivated, well managed sponsor, trading at a substantial discount to NAV.  We believe the shares today present an even more compelling risk/reward opportunity.  The opportunity now is substantially different in terms of time horizon (longer) and the ability to put more money to work (very liquid).  So I think entering this as a new idea is warranted and might be appreciated by patient value investors that like picking up $1.00 worth of real estate for .50 cents.
First, the postmortem on 2019 is as follows: 
Monetized 2/3’s of the portfolio at prices representing 98% of their estimated NAV.
Distributed $14/share to stockholders in Sept 2019 -- essentially returning 86% of the $16.25 share price of a year ago.
Leaving ‘remainco’ stub worth $4.80 per original share (1:3 reverse split) -- for a year end 2019 pro-forma total value of $18.80 per share (representing a 15.7% pre-tax IRR – no tax consequence detail yet available beyond company’s initial estimate that distribution is 70% cap gains/30% return of capital).
Importantly, the recapitalization event DID NOT accomplish CIM’s goal of meaningfully closing the ‘value gap’ discount to NAV – largely because:
The ‘remainco’ shares traded poorly post distribution (as we expected might happen given 72% of the total shares outstanding were distributed in-kind to institutions via liquidation of the CIM run partnership that owned the shares).   
Shares currently trade at a 50% discount to CIM’s most recently published (11/2018) NAV of $29.49 per share.  
So while our 2019 return was decent, our conviction on the going forward risk/return equation is stronger.  This is why:
Higher conviction in current CIM published NAV estimate of $29.49 -- given they successfully monetized $1 billion of assets in 2019 at 98% of NAV.
CIM executed perfectly on the monetization strategy – which was meant to create a ‘useable’ REIT – i.e., one with a useful equity currency for growth/scale – however the strategy failed (with the shares trading at effectively the same discount to NAV prior to the recap event.)
We think the current valuation creates greater pressure within CIM to figure out what to do with CMCT, considering it is somewhat small in comparison to CIM’s $30 Billion AUM operation.  Perhaps a logical step is to consider taking CMCT private or a complete liquidation as next steps.  On the last write up, there was a thoughtful message that said “Why does this company exist?”  Great question, maybe it shouldn’t!  I’d prefer it didn’t exist.  Liquidating or taking private would be a painless route to a nice IRR. 
Investors looking to quickly get acquainted with this idea should start here with this link where the company outlines their holdings and states a NAV per share of $29.49.
https://shareholders.cimcommercial.com/static-files/29ac294a-6a64-4b2e-8640-ff0945c569a1
Large Insider/Principal Buying -- In October 2019, CIM Group purchased 2,486,390 shares (16% of outstanding shares) from a group of seven of the institutional investors in the Urban Partners vehicle that owned a majority of the company prior to the distribution event. 
This represents a $47.3 million investment by the ownership group principals of CIM.  The purchase price in this private transaction was $19.1685 per share = 65% of NAV and a 30% premium to the then current trading price.   CIM’s principal stake is now 19%.  CIM Group’s 3 co-founders are directors.
Calpers, following the initial distribution owned close to 25% of the outstanding stock in CMCT.  They have been selling, but apparently don’t feel obliged to submit any sort of 13g that would help the general public assess the situation.  (We are not experts on this topic, but suspect they might be deficient in their filing obligations.  tisk tisk)  We believe that the selling by Calpers is creating an attractive entry point and a somewhat “all you can eat” buffet for value oriented investors.  We theorize that when Calpers gets done unloading, shares will reprice higher.  Not a promise, but just a hunch.
Based on repositioning/expansion currently well underway at certain remaining portfolio assets, NAV could grow to $36 per share at Y/E 2021.  This assumes no change in cap rates.  The current share price implies an EV cap rate of 6.5% on pro forma (post asset sales) 2019 NOI of $48M.
                POTENTIAL PRO FORMA 2021 YE NAV of $36/share based on:
AUSTIN expansion (mid 2020 completion):  42,000 sq. ft add on to 183,885 sq. ft, 97.5% leased complex – assume 8% net return on $15 million cost = $1.2 million increase in annual NOI
SHERATON GRAND renovation (503 room hotel adjacent to Sacramento Convention Center which is undergoing a $340 million renovation/expansion):  The convention center project and CMCT’s Sheraton room renovations expected to be completed late 2020 – assume 15% net return on $26 million cost = $3.9 million increase in annual NOI
4750 WILSHIRE BLVD REPOSITIONING:  138,000 square ft @ current 23% occupancy ($48/sq. ft). Being renovated to a “We Work” type shared concept. Marketing to Technology, Creative, etc. community that serves Hollywood adjacent. Based on 92% occupancy @ $48/sq. ft (current lease rates) = $4 million rent lift (80% net to NOI) beginning early 2020
ANNUALIZED NOI IMPACT APPROXIMATELY $8 MILLION 
Added to $48 million 2019 base NOI = $56 million
@5.5% cap rate = Asset Value before Debt of $1.02 billion
Less $470 million of debt/preferred stock
NAV = $550 million / 15 million shares outstanding = roughly $36/share
This represents about 10% annual growth in NOI from 2019 levels.
  Primary Oakland Growth Asset:  CIM’s published NAV calculation we estimate values the land at 2 Kaiser in Oakland (adjacent to the CIM 500K sq ft office property at 1 Kaiser) on Lake Merritt at just 1/2 of the true value.  It is fully entitled for a ‘next generation’ urban office campus of up to 850,000 sq. ft. and seeking build to suit anchor tenant(s), co-investors, or sale.  https://www.cimcommercial.com/real-estate/by-property/reinvestment?name=Beacon%20Tower&id=5506
  1 Kaiser Plaza in Oakland is a bit tricky, and this situation might be causing some concern.  Kaiser Permanente currently occupies about 2/3rds of the 1 Kaiser Plaza building in Oakland.  Kaiser recently announced intentions to build their own campus and consolidate their operations at the new facility which will be called the Thrive Center.  So the writing is on the wall that Kaiser Permanente will be slowly moving out of Kaiser 1.  That is terrible news right?  Well…not necessarily.  Kaiser Permanente is currently paying about $40 per square foot.  New lease rates are approximately $60 per square foot.  Oakland is still hot and experiencing a decade long revitalization. Of course, this causes uncertainty on them being able to fill available occupancy up when Kaiser Permanente leaves.  It is also likely that meaningful capex will be required to attract new tenants.  Another option of course would be to sell 1 Kaiser Plaza, and let an ambitious real estate developer tackle the tenant conversion project.
Here is some of the salient language regarding Kaiser Permanente at 1 Kaiser:
*Prior to February 2023, the tenant may terminate up to 140,000 square feet of space in the aggregate (of which no more than 100,000 rentable square feet may be terminated with respect to the rentable square feet expiring in 2027) in exchange for a termination penalty. From and after February 28, 2023, with respect to the rentable square feet expiring in 2025, and February 28, 2025, with respect to rentable square feet expiring in 2027, the tenant has the right to terminate all or any portions of its lease with CMCT, effective as of any date specified by the tenant in a written notice given to CMCT at least 15 months prior to the termination, in each case in exchange for a termination penalty
RISKS:
Largest tenant Kaiser Health (at 1 Kaiser) represents 30% of total rent roll – 374K sq ft @$41.50.  Kaiser is consolidating seven locations into the new 1.6M sq ft Thrive Center -- which is expected to break ground in late 2020 and open in 2023.  They will be terminating* in stages their 1 Kaiser leases that expire 2025-2027.  These leases are 20% below market versus Oakland Class A CBD but will likely require meaningful capex for competitive positioning.
In this booming economy businesses have been moving to Oakland.  In a recession it is conceivable that businesses consolidate back to San Francisco.  Difficult to predict these future trends, obviously.
We suspect that CMCT wishes it was a bigger & better REIT and that they can envision some benefits that come with larger scale.  A secondary offering could be a substantial risk, but we are comforted by their recent substantial purchase at 19.16 – roughly 20% higher than the current price.  There is a risk that involves dilution, but in our experience management and board has said all the right things about delivering shareholder value.  Importantly, their actions have followed their words and they have done right by shareholders thus far.
I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.
Catalyst
No known catalyst.  Calpers stops selling could be considered a small catalyst, I guess.  Full liquidation, take private, or merger into bigger REIT is the only thing that would really get this to NAV, and there is nothing like that being contemplated at the moment - at least that I know of.",-38.49199984531101,-27.878807635368705,-4.107385420895749,-42.32086386041719,-15.610501450509512,0.00562652512958523,15.840380032408497,31.128414421383393

Summary
FIGS Inc (FIGS) is May IPO of largest DTC platform in healthcare apparel - 82% core scrubs - disrupting commoditized $12B US and $79B global medical apparel market ($86B in 2025) per S-1 through better fit, more comfort and fashion (colors) at premium price. FIGS priced at $22 above $16-19 range and was upsized from 26 to 30M shares incl shoe with sponsor Tulco selling 30% more stock and the company -21% less than original terms. This after insiders incl Tulco and founders sold as part of 57M-share offering at $8.55/share in Oct 2020. Mgmt interviews and recent commentary emphasizing need for investment suggest deal timing may have been pulled fwd to take advantage of material pandemic acceleration. 
Bulls point to strong topline growth incl +30% CAGR implied in $1B 2025 rev target, 70%+ GMs, recent mid-20s% EBITDA margins/LT 20% target and uniquely high LTV/CAC on high retention, repeat frequency and close-knit community/word of mouth benefits. Since the stock’s doubled from IPO and sports $8.8B EV add’l rationalization now incl core scrubwear as low-CAC entry into eventual ability to expand into lifestyle wear (supposedly the next LULU). 
Bear case suggests niche DTC platform that sports unjustifiable valuation of 17x 2022 sales/83x AEBITDA on extrapolation of impressive yet unsustainable 2020-21 growth/profitability driven by stiff pandemic tailwinds that appear to be already starting to diminish. Brand is primary source of differentiation as competitors incl incumbent and legal foe SPI/Careismatic (est 40% US share) offering similar fabric, fit, finish at lower prices and have entrenched institutional relationships. And DTC windfall during pandemic may prove more 1st mover as it’s seemingly already been replicated. So concerns around fad risk, pandemic sugar-high, true SAM and share gains/CAC likely to increase given historical default to lowest cost and uncertain sustained willingness to pay 30-50%+ premium for brightly colored scrubs (trial discounts abound).  
This was a fast-growing albeit small company ($100M revs/$2M AEBITDA in 2019) prior to pandemic and loose JOBS Act disclosure requirements limit historical analysis. Certainly some pandemic benefits will prove sticky incl greater awareness/larger base of customers but pandemic benefitted the business in multiple ways that are likely under-appreciated incl 1/ trad'l B&M retail distribution model essentially went off line, 2/ more medical personnel wore scrubs both voluntarily and involuntarily, 3/ hospitals were staffed at max capacity, 4/ more scrub purchases were subsidized and 4/ replenishment cycle was accelerated. Revs grew +138% y/y in 2020, recent 2Q had revs decel q/q from +172% peak to +58% and initial $395M 2021 guide (only metric provided) implies sub-25% 2H growth (stock sold off -15% initially but recovered as buyside expectations likely remain much higher than implied guide/+30% LT CAGR). 
Mgmt appeared evasive on initial call primarily defaulting to LT targets which only plays as long as stock keeps working. Another potential issue is founders are co-CEOs and have no public-company experience while CFO brought on pre-IPO did <1-yr stint as DPZ CFO. Legal overhang isn’t core to thesis but worth noting nonetheless.  
Thesis 
While mindful of post-IPO dynamics incl limited ~30M-share float and positioning recently skewing increasingly negative (mid-30s% SI), r/r appears asymmetric as $8.8B EV or 17x 2022 revs materially overstates durability of recent growth dramatically boosted by pandemic. Recent initial print highlighted by material topline decel, need for heavier investment and limited guide/disclosure appears supportive of this view. Post-pandemic normalization incl combo of cont’d topline deceleration and increasing investment likely diminish complacency/willingness to discount elevated expectations over extended duration.    
Catalysts
Fund'l catalysts incl 1/ slowing post-pandemic growth vs buyside expectations, 2/ heavier investment (word mentioned >20x on 2Q call) and 3/ add'l supply as insiders hold 57% incl Tulco (32%) and co-CEOs (15%). 
Risks 
Primary risk is sustained post-pandemic growth/profitability above expectations and market's willingness to continue to underwrite durability (every turn on 2022 revs ~$2.50/share). Positioning has also become quite crowded very recently with rate/availability becoming more volatile and represents another key consideration. Latter combined with limited float, getting the compounder/”buy at any price” treatment from retail and 1% of IPO directed to HOOD as its 1st IPO shouldn’t be overlooked in this tape.

MANAGEMENT & PORTFOLIO

Aberdeen's management is led by Stan Bharti and George Faught drawing on the staff of their private Forbes and Manhattan merchant banking group as needed. Their most significant past successes have been:

Desert Sun Mining
First Uranium
Consolidated Thompson Mines

Aberdeen's strategy is to invest in companies where F&M management and consultants can play a significant role in helping a company realize value within a relatively short time frame (goal is 18-24 months). This usually means a substantial resource that was poorly managed, poorly financed, or poorly promoted. Review of the projects shows a focus on high grade resources with good feasibility and robust economics.
  Here's a brief introduction to Aberdeen's largest holdings. Note: total portfolio is about $116mm and all amounts shown are Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted.

Simmer and Jack/First Uranium debenture and royalty
Investment Amount: $12mm
Estimated Value at 8/15/2008: $53mm
Company website: http://www.simmers.co.za/sjfu/view/sjfu/en/page14 and
http://www.firsturanium.com/cws/projects/firsturanium/index.jsp

Investment thesis - Aberdeen provided a US$10mm convertible loan that enabled Simmers to acquire several South African mines at bargain prices from DRDGold when it was in severe financial distress. The loan is convertible into Simmers shares at 0.8 Rand. Conversion requires shareholder approval and if denied then Aberdeen receives a 1% NSR over the life of the assets acquired from DRDGold. Following the initial purchase, Simmers remained short of capital so F&M facilitated the spin-out of two projects into a Toronto-listed entity, First Uranium (FIU). FIU's Mine Waste Solutions project falls under Aberdeen's 1% NSR. The FIU listing was a huge success generating tremendous value for Simmers. Simmers shares now trade around 4 rand, far in excess of the debenture conversion price. Simmers and First Uranium have expanded their resources and production forecasts. Due to the huge appreciation in its shares Simmers shareholders are unlikely to approve conversion of the debenture so Aberdeen will receive repayment of the debenture (US$10mm) by 12/31/08 and the 1% NSR. Aberdeen's current plan is to sell the royalty. Aberdeen currently carries it on the balance sheet at a fair value of $49mm calculated using Simmers and FIU production forecasts, a long-term gold price of $700/oz, a 5% discount rate, and a CAD/USD rate of 1:1. Aberdeen has had preliminary discussions with potential buyers and says they are willing to be more aggressive with the gold price assumption, may be conservative with the discount rate, and may be willing to pay some premium for Simmer's potential to expand production. Aberdeen expects to reach agreement and receive sale proceeds in 1Q09.

Quinto Mining shares + warrants
Acquired by Consolidated Thompson Mining
Investment Amount: $4mm
Estimated value at 8/15/08: $8mm
Company website: http://www.consolidatedthompson.com/index.asp.htm

Investment thesis - Aberdeen management has been closely involved in the development of Consolidated Thompson from a $2mm junior into a $760mm company on the verge of opening a significant iron mine at Bloom Lake in Quebec. The most attractive aspect of this development is proximity to high quality rail and port infrastructure. Quinto (QU) owned claims close to Consolidated Thompson's property. Aberdeen made an initial investment in Quinto alongside CLM. Aberdeen's investment was then converted into CLM shares + warrants when CLM acquired QU. On the last cc Aberdeen said it believes CLM shares are undervalued, but Aberdeen would also like to recycle its capital into new positions, perhaps by selling some CLM shares and retaining the warrants. CLM is well-financed with $335mm in cash and no debt. Total expenditures to bring Bloom Lake into production are budgeted at $410mm; it should be no problem to find debt financing for the unfunded balance.

Central Sun Mining shares + warrants
Investment Amount: $7mm
Estimated value at 8/15/08: $5mm
Company website: http://www.centralsun.ca/index.php

Investment thesis - Glencairn Gold suffered a corporate crisis when the tailings dump at its Bellavista mine in Costa Rica became unstable. The company was out of cash and investors were out of patience. Aberdeen and F&M organized a refinancing and a new operational plan that would shut Bellavista, expand the existing and profitable Limon mine, and build a mill at the Orosi project in order to increase gold recovery rates from 38% to 90%+. With these modest developments, CSM will be able to generate high cash flow from 2009. It could be an excellent platform for regional expansion and would also be an attractive takeover target. The stock spent most of this year around double Aberdeen's acquisition price but has recently fallen due to concern about the need to raise about $20mm to complete the Orosi mill development. A feasibility study completed this year showed a 62% IRR on the mill investment and CSM believes that it can arrange debt financing for most or all of the required funding.

Labrador Iron Mines shares + warrants
Investment Amount: $4mm
Estimated value at 8/15/08: $4mm
Company website: http://www.labradorironmines.ca/

Investment thesis - Labrador (LIR) has attractive iron projects about 150km NNE of Consolidated Thompson's Bloom Lake project. Aberdeen's involvement in CLM should provide excellent insight into the potential value of LIR. LIR's initial projects will be low cost redevelopment and expansion of sites that were operated by Iron Mines of Canada from 1954 – 1982. Aberdeen management did not take any role at LIR, but it's possible that at some point CLM will try to acquire LIR. LIR is well-financed with $46mm in cash and no debt. Cash on hand should be more than enough to bring the first phase of the project into production in 2010.

Largo Resources convertible loan
Investment Amount: $4mm
Estimated value at 8/15/08: $4mm
Company website: http://www.largoresources.com/

Investment thesis – Largo has an exceptional Vanadium project in Brazil. The feasibility study released last week shows a 44% IRR on a required investment of $270mm. The high-grade near-surface resource would allow Largo's mine to be one of the lowest cost producers in the world. Largo has excellent partners for offtake (Glencore) and financing (Investec). Discussions with Investec have led Largo to believe that the robust economics of the project will allow $250mm of debt financing to be raised leaving only a modest equity financing requirement.

Other positions disclosed by Aberdeen with current value greater than $1mm are:

Avion Resources, redevelopment of a mine in Mali
Russo-Forest, private timber company in NW Russia
U308, uranium exploration in Guyana
Sulliden Exploration, gold development in Peru
Longford Energy, shell company for new oil and gas venture
Tucano Resources, private Brazil mining start-up
Virginia Uranium, private uranium company with large resource
Magma Metals, Australian company with exciting platinum development
Franc-Or Resources, Peru polymettalic project

DISCOUNT TO NAV

While I believe that many of the positions in the portfolio are attractive, the most appealing thing about Aberdeen is the large discount of the shares to the current NAV. Aberdeen will report second quarter results in early September and I believe these are likely to show an NAV above $1 per share at July 31. The company provides enough disclosure that the NAV can be estimated in real-time and can be tested using various valuation assumptions that show a large margin of safety is built into the current share price.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Stan Bharti describes Aberdeen as a vehicle for investors to join his deals at the earliest stage when potential returns are greatest, but the companies may be illiquid and public information may be limited.

Compensation: Aberdeen pays corporate overhead and the management earns an incentive fee equal to 10% of realized profits. The fee has been accrued in the financial statements. Management has also been granted options to purchase Aberdeen shares at $0.80

Share Repurchase: Aberdeen has an active share repurchase plan. It was disclosed in June that 1.2mm shares have been repurchased this year and I believe repurchases continued in July.

Insider Trading: Stan Bharti says that he feels restricted from purchasing AAB because he is always involved in negotiation of material transactions. Nevertheless he did purchase 125000 shares at $0.455 in February and a director purchased 40000 shares at $0.60 in March. Bharti's coinvestment with Aberdeen in portfolio companies presents an obvious potential conflict of interest over which the company has no formal policy. Bharti explains that the exit strategy for these investments is a corporate transaction rather than open market sales. He also points out that he does not actively trade his investments and SEDI records show that his sales have been rare at the companies he is involved in. In fact he has not reported any sales in 2008.

Investment Policy: At this time Aberdeen has no formal limits on the type of investments it can make.

Disclosure: Aberdeen provides generous disclosure about its investments and strategy.

COMMODITY RISK

Aberdeen's biggest commodity exposure is currently gold through the value of the Simmers/FIU royalty. Fortunately Aberdeen has recorded the royalty at a reasonable valuation and operating performance of Simmers and FIU seems to be good this year. Obviously the price of gold has been weak recently. I believe the chance of gold appreciation over the remainder of 2008 is strong due to a mixture of the following factors:

Gold production is falling. Mine supply is down 6% in the first half of 2008 compared to 2007 in spite of record high prices. This is the worst supply performance of any major commodity.
Gold has value in a crisis. When faith in banks and central banks declines, the value of gold rises.
Gold is fun. Strong economic conditions in the Middle East, China, and India support discretionary buying of gold jewelry.

The worst case development for Aberdeen would be a continued decline in the price of gold to a point where Simmers and First Uranium reduced their production targets.

The second commodity risk is iron through the investment in Consolidated Thompson and Labrador. Global steel and iron demand has been strong but could be vulnerable to a recession in OECD countries and any slowdown in spending on construction and infrastructure in emerging markets.

TIMING

I believe the most significant event for shareholders will be realization of the value of the Simmers debenture and royalty by 1Q09. Aberdeen will receive a lot of cash for new investments, share repurchase, and hopefully greater awareness of the potential gains from its investment approach.

2019-05-10,oldyeller,FAST,FASTENAL CO,https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/FASTENAL_CO/2182535340,18806000000.0,65.64,"Description
Fastenal (FAST), at one time a popular stock with the fundamental investment community, is now largely ignored.  However, we believe the business is undergoing a significant structural shift underappreciated by investors with earnings power that should significantly exceed consensus expectations.  This is also a very high-quality business run by a strong management team, and based on our 2021 EPS estimates of approximately ~$3.90/share (consensus = $3.28/share), we believe the stock will be worth ~$100-$110/share within 1-2 years if FAST trades at its historical average multiple of 25x.
  Fastenal is the most profitably run U.S. industrial parts and fasteners distributor. These parts are primarily sold to manufacturers and other construction-oriented companies. It sounds like a simple, commodity business – but it’s not.  The service levels require local density with national logistics and inventory infrastructure to meet same-day delivery demands of customers who need parts on short notice.  Delays in delivery equal days of customer downtime which equals lost profit for those manufacturers and construction firms.
  Our field research indicates FAST generates consistently superior returns to its peers (GWW, MSM), based on its network density (~2,200 branch locations, ~950 onsite locations and over 83,000 vending devices) and national logistics infrastructure capable of superior delivery times.  Management is also best-in-class with compensation tied to the long-term profitability of the organization.
  Since 2014, the stock has largely been forgotten by the investment community due to the perennial “Amazon fear”, industrial cycle concerns, Chinese tariffs and stagnant stock performance for multiple years.  Compounding these fears was the April 2019 average daily sales (ADS) number, which grew 7.4% annually, a marked slowdown from the low teens experienced over the past two years. 
  However, a combination of common sense and additional field work suggest the April ADS deceleration was a blip and not a new trend.  Note that Q119 earnings were released April 11th when the CEO issued rather optimistic commentary on what he is currently seeing in the business / marketplace such that a rapid shift in the last 19 days of the month would be improbable.  Our field research also suggests that ending the month mid-week combined with holiday and weather factors can occasionally cause monthly numbers to swing significantly.
  The recent increase in Chinese tariffs to 25% on $200 billion of imports has also hurt sentiment for FAST, and there is legitimate concern for that as the company’s customer base will be negatively impacted.  That said, we have confidence the underlying business performance is still sustainable based on continued market share gains from winning new national accounts.
  Consensus expectations have growth decelerating significantly from the low-teens as of Q119, down to high-single digits for the remainder of 2019 and mid-single digits in 2020 and beyond. We find this odd particularly after Fastenal has made large, multi-year investments to build a new channel serving national accounts, which represents approximately half of the business now with the ability to help drive consistent double-digit growth for the overall company. Why would growth slow so significantly within one to two years as consensus suggests?  We went into the field to find out.
  Our industry conversations painted a very different picture, stating the national account business was hitting critical mass, which would support sustainable low-to-mid-teens growth at FAST for the foreseeable future. In addition, our field research suggests investor expectations underappreciate the margin profile for national accounts. 
  Consensus believes margins will stagnate.  However, new accounts have high fixed setup costs that depress margins upfront, but as new customer account revenue ramps, margins naturally expand over the 2-3 year penetration period as the fixed cost structure is leveraged.
  National accounts also require less infrastructure than the core branch business, with G&A savings offsetting the lower gross margins, resulting in similar operating margins for both businesses. Therefore, we believe Fastenal’s operating margins will expand modestly over the coming years as the national account business grows while consensus calls for margin stagnation.
  As a result, we project 2021 EBITDA for FAST of $1.7 billion while consensus expects $1.2 billion.  The delta derives from our expectations for low-double-digit revenue growth through 2021 and 90 bps of EBIT margin expansion over that period.  As growth and margins exceed investor expectations and illustrate the sustainability of Fastenal’s current growth trajectory, the stock should trade at its historical average multiple of 25x EPS.
  This results in fair value of at least $100/share over the next 1-2 years, including the $9/share of FCF that accrues to shareholders over that time. This represents upside of 50%-60% from the current price.
I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

2007-10-08,doobadoo802,CALM,Cal - Maine Foods,https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/Cal_-_Maine_Foods/0651270341,665000000.0,28.4,"Description
Cal-Maine Foods (Short):“The kid is back on the escalator…” -Mall Rats.A long time favorite short of mine and bandit871, Cal-Maine foods is a well run egg producer, going thru yet another strong cycle.  However, eggs are a habitually cyclical commodity business, and Cal-Maine’s profitability will roll over and decline to at most historical levels within the next 6-9 mos as new capacity comes online.

Company Overview: Cal-Maine Foods is primarily engaged in the production, cleaning, grading and packaging of fresh shell eggs for sale to shell egg retailers. The Company had sales of approximately 700 million dozen shell eggs during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2007.  It primarily markets shell eggs in the southwestern, southeastern,  mid-western and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. Shell eggs are sold directly by the Company primarily to national and regional supermarket chains. Thesis Overview:  Looking at an historic chart of the company’s share-price, you can see that it has had huge swings from $1.50/share in 2002
to run almost vertically to $18/share in early 2003, followed by a waterfall decline to $6/share in ’04 and ’05. 

It has once again had another near vertical run, and will once again decline back to a more reasonable valuation of $10-$12 share.  The most recent run is entirely due to a sudden spike in the ASP of eggs from their usual $.60-$.70/dozen to current $1.15-$1.20/ dozen.  Excluding feed, the cost of producing eggs is relatively fixed, which means that Cal-Maine’s operating margin went from the
low single digits to over 15% in the most recent quarter (and if pricing holds they will run over 20% for the current quarter).  Historically, operating margins in this business have been very volatile, but have averaged roughly 4% over the past 10 years. 
In addition, this average 4%, is made of hugely cyclical swings:  Over the past 40 quarters we’ve seen operating margins as
low as -12.5%, and as high as 20.3%.  On a rolling 4 q basis, margins have ranged from -8%, and 19.5%.  An impending return
o this normal margin implies a significantly lower share-price, even if the company continues to generate massive cash-flow for
a considerable period. Industry Background: Producing eggs is not rocket science and is a commodity business with low margins for the following reason:
-Eggs are fungible, there is no way to add a unique feature, or differentiate the product in any way that is not easily duplicable by other industry players.
-There are over 65 egg producers in the US, and although Cal-Maine Foods has 15% of US market-share they are far from a monopoly and the industry certainly isn’t an oligopoly by any stretch of the imagination-There is no proprietary technology, patents, or special know-how that adds significantly to production efficiency that is not
accessible to other industry participants
-No economies of scale/scope  (SGA/dozen does not decline as production capacity rises.  E.g. over the past
40 quarters Cal-Maine Food’s production capacity has about doubled by both organic and inorganic means, yet SGA/dozen shows no trend, remaining steady around its average of 8 cent/dozen.)  So in short, Cal-Maine doesn’t get any points for being big.Basically, there is nothing within the company’s control that can meaningfully boost ROIC for any meaningful period of time.

All egg producers are victims of the tides of fortunes driven by 2 factors: Market Price of Eggs, and Feed Prices. This brings us to the
determinants of egg spot prices: Supply and  Demand.Capacity and Demand:  The last big bull market in eggs occurred in the ’03-’04 time frame when producers were caught flat-footed as a result of the sudden popularity
of the ‘high protein’ Atkins and south beach diets.  In 2005, the industry put a substantial amount of new capacity online, flooding the market with fresh shell eggs and destroying pricing power.  Cal-Maine’s gross margins went to nil in the August quarter of 2005, and posted a negative operating margin of -12.5%:  The worst in the companies history.  The horrible pricing environment, combined with rising feed costs, caused growers to cut back dramatically on their flocks, reducing them to a 4 year low by the spring of 2007. This has once again created a tight supply situation. 

Demand has also picked up, due to the weak dollar increasing our exports of egg derivatives (most shell eggs are sold fresh, and therefore there is a minimal export component of only 3-4% of annual production).  So now you are no doubt wondering how long it will take for prices to come down?  It only takes about 3 weeks to hatch a new hen,
and 20 weeks for that hen to start laying eggs.  Growers have been reluctant to commit to expanding their flocks due to the bath they took in ’05, as well as corn and soy (the primary costs in raising a hen) are up 50%.    Because the national flock is still about 12 mil hens short of its previous peak, we know that production can grow a minimum of 3-4% before facility expansion is necessary.   Pullets hatched for egg production, has been running in the high single digits all summer, and they should be up and laying by early next year.  The only head wind is that we have a moderately old flock due to the dearth of hatchings in the ’06 time frame.

Fun with Graphs:The following graph is of the Hen Flock size, as well as the number of ‘egg type’ chicks hatched (according to the USDA).  As one can see, when hatchings exceed the 2 year average (green), the flock sized eventually expends (blue), and vice versa:  http://www.geocities.com/doobadoo1/layers.JPG

The following graph shows Cal-Maine Food’s Gross margins (green), relative to and inverse of the USDA’s flocks size lagged 6 months (blue, most recent 2 dots are my estimates based on hatchings): http://www.geocities.com/doobadoo1/margins.JPG

Valuation:   I use 2 methods for valuing Cal-Maine, a DCF and an historic EV/unit of production (a hen). For the DCF my assumptions are:
- 4.2% for terminal value’s EBIT margin (Over the past 40 quarters, Cal-Maine Foods EBIT margin has averaged 3.7%)
- 10% discount rate, with a 15x  terminal multiple on NOPAT
- Effective Taxes at 36%- FY08 Egg ASP’s at $1.20 cents/dozen then returning to the 4.2% EBIT margin for ’09 and beyond

Using all the above I get a TEV of ~320mil, minus net debt of $60 mil and divided by 23.6 mil share count= $11/share or about 40% of the current share price. For those of you who love stress testing variables, using normalized OMs from 3% to 7%, and terminal multiples on NOPAT from 12-22x we get valuations from $7.25 to $24 (all below current levels).  Or more realistically, OMs from 4 to 5% with term multiples from 14 to 18 yields valuations from $10 to $15/share.

Historic Enterprise Value/Unit of Production: Before 2004, this company has never traded for more than $0.54/dozen of annual egg production (in 2007 dollars).  The average is actually $0.42 (2007 dollars). Even during the Atkins spike of 2004 it never traded above. $0.90/dozen.  Today the company is trading for more than that, at $1.02/dozen egg of annual production capacity.  Again, nothing has fundamentally changed about this company except that egg prices are currently out of control due to a short flock. 
For a quick look at my spread sheet, which includes all the graphs and numbers, visit:
www.geocities.com/doobadoo1/calm.xls

Risks: Growers don’t expand their flock to historic highs for a period of time because they are afraid of high grain prices, and day traders take the stock to $50/share.
Mark-to-Market Risk: Cal-Maine is have in very strong quarter and may earn $0.90-$1.30/share this quarter depending on egg and feed pricing which is highly volatile.

Why ports are attractive?
Before delving into the company specifically it is probably worth discussing why ports and in particular container ports are attractive.
(1)  Growth – typically in recent years container ports have been growing volumes at faster than GDP because of (a) movement of manufacturing to Asia (b) increasing economic ties across the world (c) increased containerisation (the convenience of this cannot be underemphasised). Some reports suggest global container trade will grow 8-10% to 2015.
(2)  Ports are local monopolies – it is worth remembering that ports are not just a set of berths but a whole dockside infrastructure including storage and processing facilities and transport links and hence customers cannot easily move elsewhere. Typically there are only one or a few operators at each port – and in Europe due to cities having grown around the ports land for further development is limited. Hence pricing pressure is limited.
(3)  Ports are not the final destination – typically products need to be moved from a port to a final destination elsewhere and so port operators have become solution providers eg HHLA runs its own trains across Europe
(4)  It is worth looking at a map of Europe – the opening of Eastern Europe has created demand. Due to history (lack of investment in ports and rail / road infrastructure) and geography (Denmark leads to additional mileage for ships travelling to the Polish ports) many logistic companies prefer to ship to the North Range of German ports (eg Bremerhaven and Hamburg) and then use rail to reach Central / Eastern Europe.
Background
This is a family controlled firm founded in 1865 by the Eckelmann family. I should highlight that the big moves this year are I believe because (a) the IPOs of Hamburger Hafen Und Logistik (HHFA GR) and DP World (DPW DU) have raised the profile of terminal operators – especially in Europe (b) a couple of banks (MM Warburg and Merrill Lynch have made visits to the company and written notes on it (3) as a consequence a general realisation that this is one of the top shipping terminal operators in Europe.
The company is very conservatively run. The company is a classical German KGaA structure (ie as a non family shareholder you are a passive investor). The listed tradeable shares are actually prefs – there is a 45% freefloat (the Eckelmann’s own the rest). Of the ordinaries the Eckelmann family owns 75% and Mueller & Sohn own 21% and employees own 4%.
The company is reluctant and nervous to see investors. The annual reports and investor relationships section of the company website is in unhelpful – the key documents are in German.
I am going to highlight transaction values in this note however I would highlight that I do not believe that in the short term the family will sell. However I do believe (see catalyst section) that there are reasons why transaction valuations will become increasingly important.
Assets
The holdings and structure of the company is complex. I would strongly recommend looking at the following page of the company website http://www.eurokai.com/live/eurokai_site/show.php3?id=6&nodeid=6&p=0&_language=en – however without commentary it is hard to identify the important assets in the corporate structure.
In summary – EuroKai owns 50% of EuroGate (the other 50% being owned by the city of Bremen (via BLG Logistics)). In addition EuroKai directly owns 66.6% of Contiship Italia (the remainder being owned by EuroGate – hence there is a also an indirect ownership in Contiship as well – thus the total participation of EuroKai is 66.6% + 50% of 33.3% equalling 83.25%).
A lot of the underlying ports or terminals have involvement of either local municipalities or shipping lines – hence the complex structure referred to earlier.
The following table from a Merrill Lynch note (9 Jan 2007) is the best summary of the current capacity and ownership.

Several points are important in the above table – (1) that even Merrill Lynch publishing a note in Jan 2007 was using 2005 numbers – showing how poorly covered this company is and its poor communications (2) Gioia Tauro, Hamburg and Bremerhaven are amongst the top 5 busiest container ports in Europe (3) I believe that the market may be missing the expansion occurring at Hamburg (the 2005 annual report – which is available in English – mentions that on 6th July 2005 EuroGate signed a deal with the City of Hamburg to expand the terminal run by EuroGate with new berths (the Elbe Berths and associated onshore facilities). This project is estimated to cost Eur 350m and will start handling shipments in 2010. The Port of Hamburg website (www.hafn-hamburg.de) suggests that the Eurogate owned terminal (CTH) will increase in capacity from 2.4m TEU in 2005 to 4m TEU in 2010). (4) Part of the reason for the complex structure of the company is that in the case of specific terminals the company has gone into joint ventures with shipping lines (particularly Maersk and MSC) which in turn guarantees volumes. (5) In Hamburg the major player is Hamburger Hafen Und Logistik (HHFA GR – owned mainly by the City of Hamburg – recent IPO). (6) This policy of partnership also applies to the new ports at JadeWesser and TangerMedGate
I believe that JadeWesserPort and TangerMedGate have strategic significance which is being missed by the market. JadeWesserPort is being built at Wilhelmshaven – on the North Coast of Germany (ports on the Northern Coast of Europe in this area are known as the ‘North Range’). The key points about this port are that Maersk (one of the major global shipping lines) will have a 30% shareholding and due to its position this port will be able to handle large container ships – this is important as both Bremerhaven and Hamburg have issues with draft (though the Port of Hamburg is seeking to commence deepening the River Elbe for this reason). JasseWesserPort is being positioned as a transhipment port (ie large cargos broken down for distribution in smaller ships (eg to Scandinavia) or by train (eg to central and Eastern Europe)). I believe that if it is successful this port will challenge Rotterdam and Antwerp for transhipment volumes.
In a similar manner TangerMedGate is positioned on the coast of Morroco at the Straits of Gobraltar as a gateway to the Mediterranean. In this case there are three shipping lines (Comanav, MSC and CMA CGM) which are the partners. Again the design is for next generation container ships which cannot be handled by smaller ports in the Mediterranean.
Valuation
For EV I am using the capital structure and EV estimates as per Bloomberg which gives a EV of €1.491bn (6.7m prefs (EUK3 GR) trading at €96.13, 6.76m ordinaries at €92.5 (EUK2 GR) and 0.294m unlimited partner shares at €94.32 – giving a total market cap of €1.297bn. Adjusting for cash / debts and minorities as per the last Bloomberg numbers gets a EV of €1.491bn)
I think that there are several ways to value this company (1) on a per TEU basis (2) EV/EBITDA (3) DCF
On a TEU basis I have data on five transactions (from MM Warburg):
Port
Yr
EV/TEU (€/TEU)
Orient Overseas
2006
731
P&O
2006
413
Montreal Gateway
2006
398
CSX World
2004
288
Halterm
2006
228
This averages €412 per TEU. (Unfortunately I do not have enough data to cross check on a weighted basis).
As a cross check HHLA has a EV of €4.9bn (€4.4bn equity and then minority and net debt as per Bloomberg). Currently HHLA handles 6m TEU so EV/TEU is €816 for that port on a current basis (though large expansions are planned).
Using the above numbers and a current owned capacity of 4.83m TEU and €412 per TEU gets an EV of €1.989bn for EuroKai. Assuming the ordinaries and the preferred have equal value attribution as a result (which is what most analysts are assuming) this comes to €36.18 per share so a valuation of €132.31 per preferred share (ie 38% upside).
However there are two specific issues with this (1) different ports have different value depending on location, competition, type of traffic, expansion potential, profitability and investment commitments (often when a city or government issues a license for a port various investment commitments are required) (2) EuroKai has significant upside potential from CT4 / JadeWessePort and TangMedGate – these could 3.36m TEU when they reach their full potential.
Given that there is a time lag to these ports coming online I suggest using a valuation of €200 per TEU – ie half the value of current capacity. On this basis this adds €672m or €48.83 per share. It should be noted that Bremerhaven CT4 started going live in 2006; and that the TangerMedGate will start in 2008. I appreciate it takes time for a new port or terminal to come on line so a discount to current capacity is reasonable but over the next couple of years the terminal utilisation at the new ports should reach industry levels.
On an EV/EBITDA basis the closest comparator is HHFA which is (on consensus estimates) trading at 13.5x 2007; and 11.62x 2008 numbers. In comparison EuroKai appears to be trading on 9.4x 2007 numbers and 8.24x 2008 (EBITDA of €158m and €181m for 2007 and 2008 respectively). Using the HHFA multiples for 2007 and 2008 gets EVs of €2.1bn for 2007 and 2008 so a price of €140 (ie an upside of €44 or 46%).
Transactions over the last couple of years in the port sector have ranged from 13 – 22x EV /EBITDA.
On a DCF basis the key issues are that (1) the company has been undertaking expansionary capex (as described in the port expansions above) which will unwind (2) over the next few years the company will benefit from volumes from the new ports (3) possible price increases. Based on these points it is possible to get an EV for EuroKai of  €1.9bn (FCF of 121, 126, 135, 145, and 151m for 2007 onwards with a 2% terminal growth rate and 10% discount factor). Taking the discount rate to 9% takes the EV to €2.17bn. It is worth pointing out however that even in 2010 the new terminals will not be matured and therefore a fade before a terminal growth rate is probably justified.
Conclusion
So in conclusion it appears that Eurokai has an upside of 38% or more.
Catalyst
I think there are several key catalysts (1) the new ports coming on line and maturing (2) the company may make further port acquisitions or investments (3) the increased interest in the port sector will mean this company will be better covered.",-41.17647223819081,-41.17647223819081,-94.11764713616519,-87.5,-9.659738568409654,-11.996049175345231,-41.80054318133488,-38.67967534967268

Talbots (TLB) is currently undergoing the first two quarters of a three year turnaround that could result in EPS of $1.40 and FCF of $1.80 (less maintenance capex) by 2013. Initial results have caused sales to falter, resulting in excess inventory and rendering the stock untouchable for the next few months as the company sells through this product at a loss.  While Q1 is definitely at risk, this uncertainty offers longer-term investors an attractive risk/reward. The inventory issue will eventually work itself off and with shares now trading at 10x 2011 earnings, the market is putting a very low probability on a turnaround ever occuring.  Any signs of life would result in a very quick revaluation of the business, and if management is ultimatly able to achieve their three-year goals, the stock would likely double over the same time period.
You've got to have a little patience here, we had to start with the product being fixed first, and that's what we did. We had to fix our financial health, and we did it. We're actually going to wind up having a very solid year, even though we would like to see the customer acquisition and reactivations ramp up faster, we are now able to spend against making that happen as well as refreshing the stores. We're 20 weeks into these strategic missions and we think that as we invite her back in, she does like the product, so it resonates with her, but this will take time. These initiatives will produce the desired results over time and we feel that we are totally on the right strategies. And the fact that our product innovation and product refresh has been so widely received and accepted, we're very encouraged by that. - CEO Trudy Sullivan, Q3 Earnings (12/07/10)
BACKGROUND
TLB sells clothing to relatively affluent women ages 55-65. The company has been around since launching its first store in 1947 and its first catalog in 1948. It was bought by General Mills (GIS) in 1973 which later sold out to Jusco, a Japanese retailer (later renamed AEON). Under AEON's ownership, TLB was taken public in 1993 at $9.75 a share and a market capitalization of $650MM. Shares spiked up to $50 at the top of the bubble in 2000 and settled in a trading range of around $30 for about six years until 2006. At this point the business first started to show signs of slowing down.  
In an effort to rejuvenate sales, the board decided it needed to modernize its brand to appeal to a younger demographic and in late 2007, CEO Trudy Sullivan was brought in from Liz Claiborne (LIZ) to transition the brand. Unfortunately, Trudy did not get much time because the recession started shortly thereafter. In 2008, the deteriorating economy caused sales per store to drop 14%, effectively forcing the company into crisis mode. Trudy quickly closed the struggling Men's, Kids, and UK businesses and hired Michael Scarpa from LIZ where he had served as the COO. In 2009, comparable store sales fell another 19% and management responded by cutting $150MM in costs and selling the money-losing J. Jill chain of 280 stores to Golden Gate Capital for $75MM. This sale marked the removal of a huge albatross, as TLB had actually acquired J. Jill at its peak after outbidding LIZ in 2006 by offering $517MM for the company. In 2010, TLB merged with BPW Acquisition Corp (BPW), which was a SPAC whose sole assets consisted of $350MM in cash. The deal was fairly innovative, as it enabled TLB to payoff nearly half a billion in debt while simultaneously buying out AEON's majority shareholder stake which had been an overhang for the last twenty years.
Today, TLB has a clean balance sheet and a much more focused business model. The retail business consists of stores averaging around 7,200 square feet and generating $1.7MM in annual sales. Sales have obviously been impacted by the economic environment, as prior to the recession individual stores were generating more than $2MM a year. In aggregate, TLB's retail business business consisting of 580 stores currently generates about $1B of sales a year. The company also operates its direct business which generates around $230MM in annual sales, split between $160MM Internet and $65MM Catalogue.

In total, a successful turnaround would about ~$100MM of EBITDA. The strategies being deployed were fairly basic but reasonable, and many of which had shown or were beginning to show traction in the last few months. The major ones are listed below along with general approximations of their impact.
1. Transition Brand (?): TLB currently generates 35% of its sales from customers ages 35-54, 55% from customers ages 55-75, and 10% from customers over the age of 75+. In order to increase sales, management is trying to skew away from the older 75+ demographic and pick up sales from the 35-45 demographic. To do this, the company redesigned its logo and is planning on spending an incremental $60-75MM over the next three years in a national marketing campaign to reintroduce the brand and $120MM to refresh half its stores with new fixtures and signage. The company updated a handful of stores this year and these refreshed stores are currently growing sales by 5%.
2. Close Stores ($10-30MM): Around 300 stores have lease expiration or renewal events over the next three years. The company is planning on closing 75-100 stores of which about half are losing a material amount of money. Earnings should benefit not only from shedding the bad stores but also from some decannibilization as a portion of lost sales are captured in either nearby stores or in the direct channel.
3. Optimize Sourcing ($20-30MM): The company entered into a relationship with Li & Fung in September of last year. While a lot of the easy blocking and tackling has been completed, there is considerable upside as TLB continues to refine the process. The company still sources from 69 different vendors with the top 10 representing 50% of costs. While it will take longer, smaller changes such as taking the concentration of the top 10 vendors up to 60% or shifting costs away from Asia and into emerging countries with materially lower duty costs should continue to drive margin. Management believes that further supply chain optimization will expand margins 50-75 bps a year
4. Add Outlets ($10MM): The company has opened 27 outlets so far and intends to add 60 over the next three years. The outlets are smaller at around 4,000 square feet, but they are comping up in the double-digits and generating more than twice the sales per square foot as current stores.
5. Segment Stores (?): Management segmented its stores into three different categories in order to better match product with local preferences. Specifically they identified 150 Always stores (value), 300 Classic stores (mix), and 86 Premium stores (premium). This occurred in August and product flowing in 1H 2011 should have meaningful allocation differences.
6. Overhaul IT (?): Management is planning on spending a $60MM a year to upgrade its technology systems. Most of these changes, such as upgrading the eCommerce platform and better planning allocation of product to stores, should impact revenue in small but positive ways. A number of these overhauls should be in place by Q2 2011.
TURNAROUND STUMBLES
Shares are down for the year and have underperformed the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT) by 50% over the last six months. The lackluster performance is the result of two events. The first event occurred on October 5th, when the company provided details on its turnaround plan. Management put out a detailed 152-page presentation explaining the transition but the market only took one thing from the entire commentary. Q3 sales were trending down slightly versus prior estimates of a slight gain. Shares fell 15% on the day.
The second negative event occurred on December 7th, on the Q3 earnings call. EPS of $0.27 actually beat estimates of $0.25, but comps of (7%) were lower than the already reduced street estimates. To make matters worse, management indicated Q4 would likely be down flat to negative LSD, which given the 11% increase in inventory, implied that the excess would have to be heavily promoted. As a result, gross margins were guided to be 31.5% or down 3.8% from last year's levels of 35.5%. The net affect was a reduction in full-year guidance of $0.84-0.92 to $0.70-0.78 causing the street to lower expectations for Q4 from $0.15 to ($0.02). Topping this all off, management also indicted a potential for the mid-teen rise in inventory to continue through year-end, which would put margins in Q1 at risk as well. Shares fell 23% on the day.
Also, we've guided to flat to down, low single digits in sales and based on our momentum coming out of the first half of the year, we bought inventory for a comp that would have been up low single digits. As you look at what's happening in third quarter and coming into fourth quarter, we have a little bit of an overhang on inventory that we'll be promoting and moving through the stores and moving to our surplus outlets at the appropriate time... I look at the inventory increase for the quarter of $19MM and basically two-thirds of it is related to receipt flow from holiday and one-third is really from the sales miss in the third quarter in terms of our initial expectations around sales. Roughly $6MM of inventory was being carried over into 4Q from 3Q that we hadn't originally anticipated...And obviously we want to end the year in a good inventory position. So we'll take the appropriate markdowns to get our inventory in line at the end of the year. - CFO/CEO Michael Scarpa, Q3 Earnings (12/07/10)
There are multiple explanations for what went wrong. Trudy said that they biggest problem was weak sales in August which caused some excess inventory that continued to roll through the other months. Sales picked up but not enough to catch up. They also noted that pants performed poorly, delivery timing was suboptimal, stores ran out of light-weight sweaters, weather was too hot and then too cold, jackets did not offer enough variety, not enough fashion products in the mix, etc. External research suggest that the company had good styles but poor fitting and bad allocation of sizes, resulting in pockets of product that did not sell though. Bottom line is that they ordered about $20-30MM more inventory that they needed and will now be stuck working through it until the end of Q1. The only silver lining was that business improved sequentially as August was the worst month, followed by September, then October, and then November.
VERY LOW VALUATION
About six months ago, sell-side analysts were raising price targets into the low $20s. After sales lost momentum, they are now suggesting that investors wait on the sidelines until inventory levels normalize after Q1 2011. With absolutely no reason to be owned through year-end, shares of TLB now trade at a reasonable discount to most of its peers and record-low EPS and EBITDA multiples. The single most bearish sell-side analyst can barely justify their $8 downside target.

TLB also has some overlooked assets that should be taken into consideration in its valuation. First, the company had an NOL of $130MM at the start of this year which is likely only down to about $120MM now. The company expects to reverse a substantial valuation allowance in 2012 as it becomes more likely that these tax assets will be utilized. Second, and perhaps more importantly, TLB still operates its own private label credit card. As of last quarter, they have $171MM in receivables owed by customers which generates more than $30MM a year in income net of charge offs. The company's valuation should be given some benefit for this asset or they should sell it off.
RISKS
Brand Dies. Brand transitions can take multiple years, jeopardize sales and margins, as well as alienate core customers in the process. TLB's new product was well received in the press and customer tests but the younger look may be turning off older customer before new younger customers even know that a transition has occurred. However, with good FCF and reasonably healthy margins, it is unlikely this 63-year-old brand is dying tomorrow.
IT Issues. TLB is consolidating multiple data warehouses into a single Oracle system. There could be issues as both Merchandise and Assortment planning systems are scheduled to convert in 1H 2011.

Shares of this indoor waterpark operator have been indiscriminately oversold on fears of a consumer recession, ignoring an imminent step change in embedded earnings power as the latest resort additions mature to average profitability over the next few years. At the current level, WOLF shares trade at a 15% maintenance FCF yield, a discount to NAV, a 20% discount to its slower growth peers and even a discount to the value implied by the recent sale of the Company’s two worst performing assets.
  We believe that even a moderately negative macroeconomic impact will be significantly overwhelmed by the dramatic ramp in EBITDA from $50m this year to a conservative estimate of $82m in 2008 and more than $115m in 2009 as the new properties come online.  At the current average hotel peer multiple of 9.5x 2009 EBITDA, this implies a value for WOLF’s existing properties of more than $17 per share (67% upside).  And additional upside exists as new resort developments are announced.  Based on our conversations with industry sources, we are already aware of two potential new resort locations that appear to be substantially far along in the approval process.  Both of these projects are located in premier vacation destinations (Foxwoods, CT and Lake Lanier, GA) and we believe represent ideal high barrier-to-entry locations.  We estimate the NPV of each of these projects to be at least an incremental $1.50 per share, bringing our fair value estimate for WOLF shares to $20 (nearly 100% upside).
  While the Company’s stated intentions are to eventually build an additional 10-15 resorts, we are not including this longer term growth potential in our valuation, but only the impact from projects that have already been or are substantially close to being announced.  However, if management’s goals are met, we believe WOLF has the potential to very quickly ramp to more than $350 million of EBITDA, implying a share price of nearly $50 (a 400% increase from current levels).  While we recognize that this is a long-term upside scenario, we do believe that it is realistic and serves to highlight the tremendous growth and valuation potential of this successful and innovative concept.
    VALUATION:
  Stock Price Currently Reflects an Unrealistic Bear Scenario
The current stock price assumes that new resorts will achieve operating results even worse than the original Midwest resorts.  We find this scenario almost absurd as the new Great Wolf resorts have 65-75% higher Total RevPAR than their inferior predecessor concept resorts.  There are 4 key characteristics that drive this higher RevPAR:  1) New resorts have double the amount of space dedicated to revenue generating activity (restaurants, spas, conference centers);  2) New resorts are located in more affluent demographic areas that are able to support higher room rates;  3) New resorts are in locations that do not face the same hyper-competitive environment as the Ohio and Wisconsin areas; and  4) Larger and more expensive resort formats (coupled with the recent credit crunch) have pushed out the local (and sometimes irrational) competitor.
  However, even if we assume that the new resorts generate a depressed Total RevPAR of just $195 (the estimated trough level for the Midwest resorts over the past 2-3 years), WOLF would generate unlevered returns of 7%, total company EBITDA of $88 million and a resulting stock price of $10.  Even this unrealistic (and almost absurd) downside scenario produces a stock price nearly equal to today’s share price.
  Current Stock Price Below Historical M&A Value of Worst Performing Assets
In October 2005, Great Wolf sold a 70% interest in its two worst performing assets (Wisconsin Dells and Sandusky, OH) for $114.5 million.  Post-transaction, WOLF retains 30% ownership, continues to operate the properties for a fee and licenses the brand under a 25 year agreement.  The Company receives a management fee of 6% of gross revenues and 2% of room revenues for its management services.  (Based on our conversations with the Company, we estimate this fee income stream to be greater than $2 million per year).  At the time of the sale, both resorts were struggling with a weak Midwest economy that had been hard-hit from the downturn in the auto and manufacturing industries.  Furthermore, Sandusky had to contend with a competitor who had just opened a resort within a few miles of the Sandusky location.  Not surprisingly, this irrational economic move greatly hurt the results for both resorts.  The Wisconsin Dells resort location was also suffering from competing in an oversaturated and hyper-competitive local marketplace (Wisconsin Dells is considered to be the birthplace of the waterpark and has been greatly overbuilt during the last 4-5 years).
  At the time of the sale transaction, analysts estimated the LTM EBITDA from these combined resorts to be $7.7 million, implying a 14.8x multiple or $250k per room key.  Applying this same depressed valuation to the current superior resort portfolio and including some value for the management fee contracts implies a downside share value of $11.25 (10% above today’s stock price).
  Tremendous EBITDA Growth from New Resort Openings
After building the Charlotte resort and Grapevine expansion, we estimate WOLF will produce $115m of EBITDA in 2009.

    At today’s stock price (and accounting for incremental financing needs), this analysis implies a 7.6x 2009 EBITDA multiple and a 15%+ FCF yield, well below multiples for other comparable lodging companies (9.5x average).  We believe such a high EBITDA growth profile deserves a premium to the more mature peer group, however, for conservatism, we have used the peer multiple in our valuation analysis.

Furthermore, our expectation that management will announce another two resorts in 2008 should add an incremental $3.00 per share to our valuation, resulting in a $20 share price (nearly 100% appreciation).
  Intrinsic Asset Value Provides Downside Protection
The development costs of the physical buildings and land also help to provide a trough valuation that is above the current stock price.

            INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS:
  New Resorts Produce Superior Returns
While the new larger resorts have doubled the total building costs due to waterparks that are 60-70% larger, these resorts are more profitable as they include double the amount of space dedicated to revenue generating venues (restaurants, spas, etc.).  This increase in cost, combined with the recent credit crunch, has also helped to serve as an additional effective barrier to entry and has closed the market to small under-capitalized local players.  Additionally, WOLF management has been successful in finding defensible locations for their new resorts by taking advantage of tighter zoning due to scarcity of attractive land sites in areas associated with natural vacation destinations (Williamsburg, Poconos, Niagara Falls for current resorts and Foxwoods, Lake Lanier, Mall of America for proposed resorts).
  Earnings Upside if New Resorts Perform Equivalent to Williamsburg and Poconos
Williamsburg and Poconos have achieved 17-19% unlevered returns.  If Grapevine, Grand Mound and Charlotte can achieve similar results, then 2009 EBITDA would be over $135 million.  At a 9.5x multiple, this results in a $23+ stock price, implying nearly 130% appreciation from current levels.
  First-Mover Advantage in Underpenetrated, Fragmented Market
Indoor waterparks represent a relatively new and under-penetrated concept.  Industry surveys indicate that only 30-40 facilities have waterparks larger than 10,000 sq. ft. that could be considered reasonable comparables to Great Wolf Resorts.  All of these entities are privately held and, to the best of our knowledge, no single operator has more than three resorts.  Furthermore, indoor waterparks remain geographically concentrated in the Midwest, with over 60% of the country’s indoor waterparks located in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan.  Currently, only one large indoor waterpark exists west of the Mississippi River.
  New Management Team Focused on Finding Defensible Locations
In a break from the pre-IPO strategy, Great Wolf’s current management team is committed to finding locations where the Company has a first mover advantage, the demographics are more attractive than the original Midwest locations (particularly average income per capita) and the new location can support Great Wolf’s larger and more profitable resort format.  This is in contrast to the Company’s original Midwest resorts which suffer from both a weak regional economy and intense competition. 
  International Expansion
Great Wolf is in active discussions with international developers about expanding overseas.  The Company would receive a licensing and management fee for helping to develop and operate the resort, but would not be required to put any capital into these deals.  A single arrangement should produce $2.5-$3.0 million of management fees.  We believe an announcement of a multiple site partnership is imminent over the next 12 months, however, we have not ascribed any value to this in our analysis.
  Attractive Lodging Concept
Once fully ramped, the new larger format resorts (Poconos, Williamsburg, Niagara Falls) should continue to grow and generate high-teen unlevered returns.  In contrast, hotel resort and lodging concepts typically generate low-teen unlevered returns (based on our conversations with industry analysts).
  Solid Balance Sheet
All of Great Wolf’s projects are fully funded.  Despite the recent credit turmoil, the Company just last month secured construction financing commitments for its Charlotte, NC resort.  In 2009, WOLF should be levered at roughly 4.5x Debt/EBITDA, in-line with other comparable hotel companies.  Great Wolf finances all of its projects through non-recourse debt tied to specific resorts and with minimal/no covenants.  Additionally, Williamsburg does not have any mortgage debt tied to the property, allowing the Company additional financing flexibility.  Furthermore, management remains in active conversations with potential equity partners regarding the financing of future projects.  We expect a positive announcement around these discussions within the next 3-4 months.  Such a development would be significant, as it would not only further alleviate funding requirements going forward, but would also allow Great Wolf to keep the economics from the valuable management fee for operating the resort.
  Future Upside Optionality from Recapitalizing the Balance Sheet
We believe significant opportunity exists to create value from developing resorts that provide over 15% returns and selling these projects to yield seeking real estate funds with much lower costs of capital.  While this recap scenario is clearly shut-off in the current credit environment, we know at some point normalcy will return and real estate investors will begin re-seeking attractive yields.  At that stage, Great Wolf will have multiple resorts with track records and the company can divest these assets to create an asset-light balance sheet and in turn, become a company where a large percentage of its earnings come from management and licensing fees for operating these divested resorts.  We believe such a transaction could be worth $25-30 per share as the resulting earnings stream would command a significantly higher multiple and the asset sales would produce an attractive dividend.
    RISKS:
  Consumer Slowdown
We believe the Great Wolf concept is actually better positioned than most resort/lodging concepts with respect to its ability to weather a consumer slowdown.  WOLF’s core customer base consists of middle to upper class families that we believe will continue to take some type of family vacation irrespective of the broader economic outlook.  Most importantly, however, the regional Great Wolf concept represents a cheaper alternative to a far away resort destination and the shorter-stay format and driving distance proximity acts as a compelling substitute for many families during such periods.
  Furthermore, we believe that Great Wolf’s valuation is supported regardless of one’s assumption about the near-term performance of the original Midwest resorts or the new projects.  To illustrate this point, we have created the tables below to show the effect of increasing/decreasing Total RevPAR at current resorts as well as the assumed Total RevPAR needed to achieve a certain unlevered return at a new resort.  Since Great Wolf no longer provides per resort performance data, we have relied on conversations with management along with some triangulation of historical data.  We believe current large format resorts that have had time to ramp-up (Williamsburg, Poconos, Niagara) are generating ~$350 Total RevPAR (includes room fees plus F&B) and ~40% fully loaded unit margins.  The chart below makes some general assumptions to show the directional effect on profitability of changing resort top-line assumptions.  The key takeaway is that this stock offers tremendous upside from current irrationally depressed levels, even in a moderate consumer downturn.

    Entrance of New Competitors
Due to the 2-3 year timeline it takes to permit, secure financing and develop a new resort, we have fairly good visibility on the competitive pipeline.  Based on our conversations with management and industry sources, we are not aware of any new waterpark developments that have achieved permitting or secured financing in Great Wolf Resorts’ current locations.  Obviously with a successful concept, it will only be a matter of time before a new competitor enters one of WOLF’s current markets.  However, with such an underpenetrated national market opportunity, we would expect a rational competitor to first select locations that do not overlap with Great Wolf’s current footprint.
  Due to the large capital expenditures required to build out the new resort format, we believe Great Wolf’s current strategy of partnering with branded partners (i.e. – Paramount, Ripley’s and the Chehalis Reservation) not only helps to mitigate capital costs, but also helps to eliminate potential competitors.
  Construction Delays and Cost Overruns
Historically, the Company has not had an issue finishing projects on time and on budget.  Great Wolf’s high unlevered returns have been achieved despite operating in a robust and inflationary construction market – and we expect to see an easing of cost pressures going forward.  In terms of the Grapevine and Grand Mound projects, management continues to believe that both resorts will be finished on time and for around $350,000 per room key.
  Limited Portfolio Diversification
Due to its small number of current resorts (12 including projects already underway), a disruptive event at a single resort could potentially have an adverse impact on the Company’s overall performance.
    BACKGROUND
  Great Wolf Resorts is the largest owner and operator of indoor waterparks in North America.   These resorts are family-oriented destinations that typically feature a 300-400 room hotel combined with a 50,000 – 100,000 sq. ft. indoor waterpark.  These waterparks include elaborate slides, a lazy river, treehouse water forts, indoor wave pools, etc. (For a visual overview of one of their indoor waterparks, see the following link: http://www.greatwolf.com/Locations/Poconos/waterparks/index.aspx ).
  WOLF’s resorts target middle to upper class families that are usually within a 100-250 mile radius from its properties, have children under the age of 14 and are looking for a fun, drive-to vacation that can generally be booked on short notice.  Room rates typically range from $200-$350 per night, with an average rate of $250.  It is important to note that these rates include free access to the waterpark.  Non-room spending averages an additional $122, resulting in total revenue per occupied room (RevPOR) of $362 per night.
  A key characteristic of the Company’s concept is that it provides an experience of family togetherness in a safe, welcoming environment and all for a reasonable value.  At Great Wolf, parents can join their kids for some of the action, yet also feel safe about letting their kids run off while they choose to relax and enjoy some downtime.  This experience differs greatly from the larger theme parks, which are typically geared toward older teenagers and which have crowds which can be overwhelming, often resulting in atrocious lines to get on the rides.  This is obviously not the type of environment in which a parent will let their 8-12 year old run around unsupervised, which means as a parent, you also have to wait in those painful lines.  In contrast, only guests staying at the Great Wolf resort are able to access the waterpark. We believe this is a critical aspect that limits crowds and guarantees easy access to the rides. 
    OVERVIEW OF RESORTS
  The new and larger resort format typically costs around $350,000 per room key to develop and, based on recent experience at the Poconos and Williamsburg resorts, generates very healthy 17-19% unlevered returns.

Summary
  Trade shows can make wonderful businesses.  But some of their unique qualities also make them very susceptible to sudden stops in travel or large meetings.  Alhough I have argued in the past for trade show resilience in general, and this stock appears cheap at 6-7x consensus earnings, operating leverage, financial leverage, and a turnaround challenge combine with covid-19 risks to make this currently unsafe as a long, in my opinion.
  Introduction
On VIC I have written up four longs on trade show companies, including this one, and one other short.  Over the years, despite a mixed track record and sometimes well after my exit, each one of these other trade show businesses got bought out, with premium valuations paid for unique industry characteristics.  But the very qualities that work so well in most scenarios falls prey to one major risk: any event which sharply reduces appetite for travel or congregating with lots of people.
Nails4 presciently asked in January 2018 whether there was a structural short to be had in the tradeshow and events industry.  (https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/ASCENTIAL/9228884397#messages)  His timing was fantastic, and this stock would have been the best way to do it, subsequently down 68%. 
  After last week’s developments on covid-19, nathanj asked on the EEX thread:
  “Anyone care to weigh in on the impact of travel concerns due to coronavirus? 
At some point does financial or strategic buyer step in or is this too toxic an asset?”
I write up my response here as a short.  I am not short, because I rarely like concentrated shorting.  But I want to explain why, though falling knives can make good investments, I do not think this is one of them.
  Risks to the short
  1. 66% owned by Onex, Canadian PE.  It is hard to handicap the chances of a takeout. Onex founder is still active, and a billionaire.  
  (But: Onex has failed to sell its controlling stake into a red-hot private market for trade show assets since the 2017 IPO.  The Onex fund which holds the majority of the EEX stake is 2009 vintage, so might lack the appetite to redeploy its $290 million cumulative EEX proceeds to defend its remaining stake valued at $323 million.)
2. US trade show attendees rapidly lose their fear of Covid-19.
3. Generic risks of shorting.  Leverage works both ways.   
  Short thesis
  1. Covid-19 fears temporarily stop some buyers and exhibitors attending US trade shows, creating operating leverage problems. 
2. Financial leverage problems. 
3. Turnaround problems.
    1.  Covid-19 fears temporarily stop some buyers and exhibitors attending US trade shows, creating operating leverage problems. 
  Case Study 1: Comdex, Las Vegas computer trade show, 2001.  Sheldon Adelson developed one of the world’s largest trade shows of all time in the 1980’s and 90’s, before selling out to Japan’s SoftBank (!) in 1995 and then making another fortune in Las Vegas.  Some weakness ensued, but it was 9/11 and the subsequent fear of flying that saw attendance drop 40%. Within a few years the show closed. The name was sold (comdex.com now routes to Informa’s Interop show, and a Computex is still held in Taipei), but a wonderful business went from hero to essentially zero.  Joel Greenblatt refers to this as his most disastrous investment (see appendix, below).
  Case study 2: SARS, Asia 2003.  In 2003, Global Sources was preparing in Shanghai to launch its first face-to-face trade show.  SARS almost killed the tradeshow venture before it began. But the founder had developed a group that was already serving its customers online and in print, enabling the company to survive.  They then rode a post-SARS boom and built a successful portfolio of trade shows that formed a key attraction for Blackstone’s 2017 acquisition.
  “But the summer before the first Shanghai show, the survival of the whole business hung in the balance. A near-pandemic outbreak of a new flu mutation was paralyzing much of Asia. In the early months of 2003, the virus known as SARS spread from Guangdong to infect 8,096 people in 37 countries. In the end, only 12 confirmed deaths from the disease were recorded, but during the spring and summer of 2003, panic and uncertainty gripped the region, implemented strict quarantines at border crossings. Travelers found with a fever faced quarantines of up to 10 days in length.
In Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China, hospitals and even apartment buildings with known SARS cases were completely sealed off. And throughout Asia, people on the streets wore surgical masks to keep the disease at bay.
The economic impact was immense. Tourist and business travel plunged. In late April 2003, economists at Morgan Stanley estimated China’s economy was shrinking at an annual rate of 2 percent in the second quarter.
Global Sources took a strong, pro- active stance. Unable to travel easily, buyers around the world made heavy use of Global Sources Online, with RFIs on the site spiking by up to 50 percent more than usual in the month of April. In early May, Spenser Au sent a series of emails to exporters throughout Asia offering a US$500 rebate on Global Sources advertising packages to encourage their active online promotion. A few weeks later, other B2B online services followed suit with various special offers.
By late summer, the SARS outbreak began to subside. Merle remembers: “The biggest challenge during the SARS epidemic was managing the fear and uncertainty of suppliers, buyers and team members. The virus emphasized the importance of online and print channels as an alternative, but the value of face- to-face negotiation was also underlined by its absence.”  The pent-up demand for face-to-face meetings may have contributed to the enthusiastic buyer attendance at the first China Sourcing Fair in Shanghai that fall.”

(N.B. the quoted SARS death count seems lower than current records). 
  Why operating leverage is especially acute in the tradeshow industry
a) Temporary breaks can kill a trade show business.  Exhibitors (typically the paying customers, in a two-sided model) re-book after a successful show.  Hence the predictability and wonderful economics of deferred revenue. But if a show does not happen one time, even if the crowd survives, it will often congregate in future at a different place.  Turns out Americans did fly again after 2001. And the crowd still meets face to face, at very valuable shows like CES, SaaStr, or dreamforce. But not at Comdex.
b) Trade shows are capital-light: a major advantage as an investment.  But once the crowd is gone, salvageable value is close to zero.
c) Concentration of event risk.  The biggest crowd is the most profitable, but right now, potentially the biggest health problem.  So although Emerald organizes 142 separate events, their Top 5 account for 30% of sales and an even higher proportion of profits.  If one big show flops, it matters.
   2.  Financial leverage problems
  On Dec 31, 2019, net debt was $531 million, bigger than current market cap.  Leverage was already 4.2x (net debt/adjusted EBITDA), up 0.8 turns during the year as adj. EBITDA declined 21% during 2019. A new CFO was hired January 16, 2020. He seems well qualified, but I don't think he has trade show experience. In his first earnings call February 13, although he claimed that there was not much risk at this level, he made clear that he would prefer it to be lower, and hoped to get there by year end.
  Ajdusted EBITA fell $35 million in 2019, to $128 million. A decline this year of $31 million, if net debt remains constant, would get leverage to the 5.5x covenant.
  The new CFO chose to not give any full year guidance at his first Q1 2020 call. But he did acknowledge a question that leverage might go up in the next few quarters. We already know from Dec 31, 2019 deferred revenues (exhibitors’ fees are collected between 1 year and 1 months prior to most shows), that 2020 sales should decline by $5.1 million (2.7% decline in deferred revenues).   
  Cash collections were also deteriorating in Q4 2019, declining $3.2 million (the proportion of deferred revenue included in accounts receivable increased from $49.8 to 53.0 million).
  This month’s US travel ban on all Chinese exhibitors will have some impact: up to a decline of $11 million as explained by the new CFO this month:
  “Our revenue in 2019, for the full year, from exhibitors from China was between 2% and 3% of our total revenue. Not a lot, but not inconsequential, right? That's real money. And last year, as the company talked about throughout the year on their earnings calls, there was pressure on Chinese exhibitors because of the trade war and the tariffs. And so 2019 was down from 2018 because of that issue. So there was a higher number in 2018 modestly than what I said. It was a little north of 3% as opposed to between 2% and 3%. And -- but in terms of year-over-year risk, we're looking at the 2019 metric. And we're looking at it in total. I would say that not 100% of that revenue is at risk because some shows have already traded, but as we sit right now, there's a travel ban. People can't come from China here. And so they are not going to come to our shows as long as that travel ban is in place. When it comes to the insurance, if somebody has already contracted to be an exhibitor and has to cancel because of the travel ban, which they can't control and we can't control. We believe that there is recoverability from our insurance. We're working through that. There's no guarantee of that. And that will play out over the coming weeks, I would expect. And what insurance would not cover is the theoretical person who never signs up and come to our show. And so there's likely to be some impact during the year. With or without insurance because of that dynamic, that's really hard to quantify. But the totality, as I said, of all our revenue over the course of the full year last year from Chinese exhibitors was between 2% and 3%.”
So financial leverage was deteriorating before the most recent covid-19 developments: the material risk that US participants develop a fear of attending trade shows. 
My last comment on financial leverage does not conform to conventionally held wisdom on deferred revenues.  Most bankers and their happy corporate customers choose to ignore deferred revenues when calculating financial leverage.  I think that is wrong, or at least not conservative. Customers who pay up front for a service or product are basically lending you money, which you will need to repay in the form of that service or product.  If you have used that cash for dividends, buybacks, acquisitions, or anything other than its original use (like almost all these publicly traded companies have), then I think it adds to financial leverage. In this case, that would add $187 million of leverage, or an additional 1.5x turns.  Most people don’t seem to agree with me. But even in a good scenario, the company would only get to keep 20% of this as its post-tax margin, so I have always considered it reckless to ignore this aspect of financial leverage. 
  3.  Turnaround problems
  There have been three CEOs since the April 2017 IPO, with one of the resignations unfortunately due to ill health. After David Loechner, 35 year veteran, retired in November 2018, free cash flow has dropped by a third to December 2019.   This despite spending cumulatively $150 million of the $159 million IPO proceeds on acquisition.
  In hindsight I did not appreciate how poorly positioned the core business was at IPO.  As of two years ago, 85% of the retailers that came to their shows had less than 4 brick-and-mortar stores.  Still today, four of their Top 5 shows serve these mom and pop retailers: a structurally challenged crowd.
  The good news for 2020 is that two of the Top 5 (Kitchen & Bath Industry and Future Market NY Now) plus the smaller Outdoor & Snow Show have already completed.  KBIS is growing, and 85% of next year’s floor space has already been booked.
  But ASD Marketweek will be held March 22-25 in Las Vegas.  This is a struggling show that, due to its seasonal repeat in the fall, accounts for two of Emerald’s Top 5.
  Seasonality does not help.  Two thirds of annual EBITDA has traditionally been earned in the first two quarters of the year.  But this increased to 79% in 2019 as earnings declined.
  So in addition to financial leverage, the business was also facing turnaround challenges before recent covid-19 developments. What happens if you combine these with negative operating leverage? 
  Globally, many big trade shows have already been cancelled, prompted either by government decree or a critical mass of exhibitors pulling out.  Trade shows’ value proposition: face-to-face contact and handshakes with multiple strangers in confined spaces, could temporarily be a major weakness. 
  Emerald so far has not had to cancel any event due to covid-19, and only operates in the US.  They did issue the following warning for attendees at its recent Outdoor retailer show: https://www.outdoorretailer.com/2020/01/28/coronavirus-update/
    End Note: I wish everyone good health; and would take neither pleasure nor profit from this business suffering as result of any health crisis.  
  Appendix
  Joel Greenblatt, interviewed by Howard Marks in 2015
  Joel Greenblatt: “I wouldn’t call it my worst investment but I'd say my most disastrous investment. I don't know.  Anyway, I've had a bunch. My partner Rob Goldstein who joined in 1989 always jokes that you know, if we worked for someone else over the last 15 years they would have fired us about eight times, you know, so you have you have to be willing to, I guess, make mistakes and you can't really avoid it.
  And so our worst one was probably we actually bought through a spin-off a company that actually owned Comdex, which used to be a computer trade show.  And it was the biggest one. We were actually able to create it before the spin off for about $3 a share; and it was going to sell some new shares at $6; and that had been announced, but yet we could create it by buying the parent and shorting another piece and creating what was left for about $3.
  So all good, so far.  But we actually fell in love with the business.   What I loved about the business was that they ran this trade show in Las Vegas and you could rent all the trade space you wanted in Las Vegas at the time, and it was available about $2 a square foot and they could re-rent it at $62 a square foot.
  So whenever the trade show grew, they would spend another two dollars and get a $62 contribution. And so we fell in love with the operating dynamics of this business and the stock actually went from $3, they sold some more stock at $6, and the stock actually went to $12.   And we had a really large position at $3. The reason for that is that we thought we could get out right away at $6. We did not get out right away at $6 because we fell in love with the business. It went to $12. So it sounds good so far! But then unfortunately shortly after September 9th 2001 the company bought another trade show and borrowed a lot of money.  Then, after September 11th, no one wanted to travel at all and both trade shows really went downhill.
  Everyone knows about financial leverage. Meaning, you know, hey, you borrow a lot of money, you pay your money you take your chances.  You put up a dollar you borrow nine, you know that's a risky investment! 
  So this is how I learned about operating leverage, which is when you lay out another $2 and collect $62, when the sales go down, right, when you lose $62 in revenue, $60 of your profits just evaporated and it drops immediately to the bottom line, that's called operating leverage.  So that was my lesson in operating leverage the stock. I think I got out at a little over $1 or so…
  You know, things happen.  It's a lesson in concentration.  It's a lesson in operating leverage.  I learned a lot of things, and I can still safely say I'm always learning.  I'm always making a new mistake. I'm trying not to make the same ones. But the same ones usually have a little different face on them; you are really making the same one but, you know, it presented in a little different way and you didn't notice it.  And you go make that mistake again and so I guess advice would be: “Don't be shy about making mistakes, because you will anyway.”   
  Skip Howard Mark’s reply if you don’t need any encouragement at a time like this:
  Howard Marks: “I think that's very important what Joel just said, and I want everybody in the audience to take cognizance of it. I wrote a memo in April called dare to be great.  And basically it said if you want to be exceptional as an investor, you have to dare to be great. Everybody here is willing to be great.
  But to be great you have to be different because if you think the same as everybody else, you'll make the same actions.  If you take the same actions you'll have the same performance. You certainly can't be exceptional if you follow the common course.  So to be exceptional you have to be different.
  You also have to dare to be wrong. And nobody bats a thousand.  The best baseball history hitter in history got four hits every ten times to the plate, right?   Some investors can do a little better than that. But nobody bats a thousand. You know Joel mentions that he could have been fired eight times.  And I had lunch today with a guy who works for Berkshire Hathaway, and we were talking about what makes Warren successful. I said one of the things that makes him successful is he is not afraid of getting fired.
  But very few people have that luxury and the question is for those of us who work in the world where we can be fired, if not by our employers then by our clients, will we still take the chance and back our ideas?  There are no sure things. Will you back the things that have a chance of being wrong? I think you have to take that chance.”

Thesis
We believe that OLLI is a commoditized retailer with no economic moat, no brand equity, no differentiated product and low barriers to entry. Since 2016, discount and off price retailers have been in a goldilocks environment of cheap backfill square footage available for new stores, abundant inventory due to department store and manufacturer malaise, benign wage inflation and little to no headwinds for the lower end consumer. We believe these factors are coming to an end and new headwinds such as higher freight and labor costs will emerge.  We find OLLI’s to be a compelling short at today’s levels. A rising cost environment coupled with an extremely lofty valuation leaves OLLI’s susceptible to any disappointment in expectations. We believe fair value is at $38. Using the group average 20x P/E on 2019 EPS of 1.90 implying 35% downside.
  Company Overview
Ollie’s Bargain Outlet is a deep closeout retailer of brand name merchandise in a treasure hunt experience known for an assortment of “GoodStuff Cheap”.  The company offers a broad selection of brand name products, including housewares, food, books and stationery, bed and bath, floor coverings, toys and electronics.   As of 4Q17, the company operated 268 retail locations. Ollie’s sales by category include housewares (12.7%), food (12.7%), books & stationery (10.6%), bed & bath (10.1%), floor coverings (8%), toys (5.2%), electronics (6.7%) and other (33.9%), with 70% of purchases coming from closeouts, and 30% from non-closeout/private label.
  Key Facts:  
·         Operates 268 stores in 20 states; opened 34 net new stores in 2017
·         OLLI is targeting 15%+ sq. ft. growth per year to 950 stores over time
·         In 2017 65% of Ollie’s sales came from its 8.1M Ollie's Army loyalty members membership as grown at 27.5% 6 year CAGR
·         Ollie’s customer by age and demographics, 78% of customers are older than 31 years of age, with 63% of Ollie’s Army members earning $50K per household.
·         Competition: Big Lots (BIG), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Dollar General (DG), Five Below (FIVE)
  Inventory closeout tailwind fading
OLLI has been a significant beneficiary of a favorable inventory environment driven by weak retail and CPG company sales leading to elevated inventory levels over the past two years. As shown in the table below, retail inventory to sales rose sharply over the last several years as consumer spending was less robust than many retail and consumer packaging companies anticipated – leading to a sharp rise in inventory levels. As companies adjusted to the consumer environment over the past several quarters, inventories relative to sales have started to gradually decline. Based on recent company commentary, we believe inventories relative to sales will continue to decline.
  Newell Brands recently commented in February at an industry conference that the mass channel inventory liquidation that impacted nearly all consumer goods companies over the last year was waning. In addition, Colgate management also commented on fading inventory issues.
  “The mass channel inventory liquidation which has affected all consumer ""goods companies over the last year or so begins to wane quite frankly in the second half of 2017 and I don't believe is really an issue for this dynamic in the back half – I mean the first half of 2018 and into the balance of the year.” – Mike Polk, Newell Brands CEO, February 2018
  “The inventory destocking would seem to be behind us, and we’re building against the underlying growth in the categories going forward” —Colgate Palmolive, November 2017
  The bull case on Olllie’s is that it is a secular growth story with double digit unit growth plus low to mid-single digit same store sales growth.  However, historically, the company has experienced volatile sales growth. As shown in the table below, OLLI’s same store sales have been flat to down in several quarters over the past 5 years. Considering OLLI’s has been operating in one of the most favorable environments for its business model and is “only” experiencing 3%-4% same store sales growth, we question how negative same store sales will be received when low cost inventory is no longer readily available. In our view, OLLI’s is a consensus long among many growth investors while other consumer focused investors have flocked to OLLI’s stock given its “safe haven” status due to its steady comparable sales recently and unit growth story – ultimately driving a materially upward move in OLLI’s valuation.
  Consumer Headwinds
  According to JPM analysis: gas prices would be up 6% year-over-year in 2018 equating to a $80 wallet headwind for the $30-$40k income core dollar store consumer on our math with every 10 cent increase in the average price per gallon an incremental $55 in annual spend at the $30-$40K income level. As you can see below from the Bloomberg Gasoline Index prices have started to move higher than JPMs initial assessment and are up over 10% yoy already in 2018, using their math that is approximately $231 in incremental annual spend.


  Expense headwinds increasing
  Wage Inflation:
Olli Q3 2015 Earnings Call: “with regards to any potential wage pressures we might see in the future, from a hiring perspective, we've looked at the impact of going to the $9 per hour rate. That impact on our business would be very, very immaterial and something that we would be able to manage through. If and when the wage impacts were to actually go to a $10 rate on our overall basis, that would cause a little bit more pain”






Freight Costs Rising:
  The freight size is a real thing right now, and it's a component really of some of the driver shortages that we'll see how long that lasts. And where we are on diesel fuel, diesel fuel is sort of back to the future 2015. We're almost starting to the same price per gallon. – DLTR March 2018 Earnings call
  We incurred higher freight cost in the third quarter as we expanded our pool of freight partners to maintain our service level. Third, we experienced high turnover levels at our warehouse that resulted in the use of an experienced higher cost third-party workforce. We expect these increases in freight and warehousing expenses to continue into Q4 as we continue to prioritize our service levels to our customers - PBH Feb 2018 Earnings Call
  The more significant challenge is on inbound freight from a domestic standpoint. And we, like every other retailer that you've probably covered so far this earnings season, are paying attention to those costs very, very closely – BIG March 2018 Earnings Call
    Conclusion:  
  Ollie’s is a compelling short.  We think that there is significant risk to revenue growth and earnings expectations in 2018 and 2019.  As these expectations are reset, we expect the stock rerate significantly lower. Our base case is the stock should trade at $38. Using the group average 20x P/E on 2019 EPS of 1.90 implying 35% downside.

Berkshire Hathaway is certainly one of the best-known companies by the value investing community, so this investment idea is certainly not original in the sense of a newly discovered company. Nevertheless, I feel that when it comes to the private businesses owned by Berkshire, some aspects are often underappreciated.
  This writeup will focus solely on the non-insurance, privately held businesses of Berkshire Hathaway, and its relation to the overall valuation of the company. At the current share price, I find Berkshire, a good investment candidate. This is especially the case when considering the value of these privately held businesses which are not fully reflected in the book value of the company.  
  A.    Non-insurance Businesses: 
  1. BNSF
The largest single private non-insurance business under Berkshire is Burlington Northern Santa Fe, which was acquired between 2009-2010 (first roughly 20% and then the rest of the company).
  For BNSF, the Berkshire annual report reports their figures. In 2019, BNSF had $23.5 billion in revenues and $ 5.5 billion net earnings. This compares in 2010 (when it was acquired) of $16.6 billion revenues and $2.6 billion in net earnings. So earnings more than doubled. So how much is this business worth?
  One way to assess this, is to compare it to their still listed peer: Union Pacific. If you just use Union Pacific's PER of 19x (that business earned $ 5.9 billion in 2019 and trades at an market cap of $ 107 billion and an EV of $ 137 billion), the calculation for BNSF’s  valuation comes to $ 105 billion.
  By revenue, BNSF is the largest railroad company in the United States (neck and neck with Union Pacific) and a similar valuation seems roughly sensible. With a gross margin of approximately 30% and with a return on tangible capital of > 20%, BNSF is a good compounder and I would think a 19x PER multiple is fair.
    2. Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE)
  Berkshire Hathaway Energy is comprised of the acquired Mid American Energy (acquired in 2000) business as well as several other energy businesses including PacifiCorp (acquired in 2005) and Northern power grid. All in all, this group of businesses earned (net earnings attributable to BHE) $ 3.1 billion in 2019 and which has consistently grown over the years at mid-single digit percentage terms.
  If we take a similar multiple as Berkshire paid for Mid American Energy for this business (17x PER), then a reasonable value attributable to BHE may be $53 billion.
  As background, Berkshire Hathaway announced the acquisition of Mid American Energy in 1999, which was then completed in 2000. The purchase price of the shares bought out was $ 35.50 and the EPS in 1998 of the listed company was $ 2.01, hence roughly 17x PER. The EV calculation would be different as Mid American had significant net debt, but this is a back of the envelope calculation above.
    3. Precision Castparts & Other manufacturing
  Precision Castparts, before they became private were growing double digits for many years. From what I could put together, Buffett paid $ 235 per share in 2015 for each share of Precision. In 2015, the company had a net income of roughly $ 1.5 billion, which was about $ 11/share. So Buffett acquired PCC at a valuation just north of 20x PER. In total BH paid $ 37 billion for PCC.
  Also included in this section is Lubrizol for which BH paid $ 9.7 billion for it in 2011. In total PCC and other manufacturing businesses (includes also Marmon, CTB, IMC) generated a pre-tax earning of $ 9.5 billion. If we assume that the whole group has a bit lower quality than PCC, and a fair valuation maybe 10x EBIT, we come to roughly another $ 95 billion for these businesses. Please note this is a very rough estimate. 
    4. Service & Retail
  This group of businesses includes See’s Candies, RC Willey, Flight Safety, BHA, Nebraska Furniture Mart, McLane, Pampered Chef etc. 
  I won’t go into details for these businesses, but in aggregate as per the 2019 BH annual report, these businesses generated a pre-tax earnings of just under $ 3.0 billion. Maybe in total we can attribute a value of around $ 25 billion for these.
    B. Valuation
  All in all, my purpose is not to exactly pinpoint the value of all Berkshire Hathaway’s private non-insurance businesses. Rather it is to show that many of these have significantly grown over the years and it is clear that the underlying book value reflecting these assets far understates their real value. This is the case even when considering a discount investors may want to take for the illiquidity of these positions.
  Taking the balance sheet figures from Berkshire Hathaway’s 2019 annual report, the book value reflected of these private non-insurance businesses is just around $ 100 billion. From the above analysis, I would conclude that the real intrinsic value of these businesses has grown to perhaps a bit above $ 250 billion.
  Ultimately, what this means is that when we referenced a 1.10x book value valuation figure in 2010 or 2012, this is not the same as a 1.10x book value today. Today the gap between the book value and the intrinsic value of the private non-insurance businesses is significantly more.
  In this light, looking at the valuation of Berkshire Hathaway, which is currently trading at roughly 1.2x book value (green line), seems to be a very fair valuation for a still high-quality compounder. In the last 20 years, only during 2000 and 2008-2011 did the shares trade at a similar or slightly greater discount, and I would argue that at the time the intrinsic value was closer to the book value than now. 
       I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

Hengdeli (listed as 3389 on the HK stock exchange, or “3389”) is a classic net net play, trading below <50% of liquidation value, with the added bonus of being profitable and benefitting from structural tailwinds in Chinese luxury goods demand.  After cleaning up the corporate structure in a 2017 transaction, 3389 is now a clean HK-centric luxury watch retailer that has started to reward shareholders via dividend payments and share buybacks funded by its overcapitalized balance sheet. At today’s share price around HKD0.37, Hengdeli is trading at a ~50-60% discount to conservatively estimated liquidation value mainly supported by (i) its large cash holdings (~HKD0.50) and (ii) large watch inventory (HKD0.27). We are classic value investors that normally invest in DM situations or at least want to invest in USD assets or be compensated for EM risks, but we think the risk-reward is quite favourable in this instance.  We appreciate retail isn’t the flavour of the month, especially retailers based in Hong Kong that have a controlling shareholder, but we think the attractions of the business and valuation outweigh the risks. Despite fears about Chinese growth slowing, there is structurally increasing wealth in China and burgeoning demand for luxury products.
  Company Background
3389 was founded and is controlled by Mr Zhang Yuping. Hengdeli is the original luxury watch retail brand in mainland China and starting with the Beijing store, Mr Zhang rolled up numerous the historical Hengdeli branches and IPO’d them as 3389 in September 2005. Since IPO, 3389 has gone through a series of acquisitions and divestitures, including the acquisition of Elegant International Holdings Limited, which forms the core of 3389’s present day operations, and several divestitures, including the divesting of the original mainland Hengdeli operations, which were sold back to Mr Zhang in the “Very Substantial Disposal” (“VSD”) transaction in 2017. Today, 3389’s operations primarily comprise the Elegant-branded stores in Hong Kong, luxury watch retailing operations in Taiwan and in Malaysia, as well as an accessories manufacturing business.
  Industry Description
Whilst the unit economics of luxury watch retailing isn’t as attractive as it may be for other retail subsectors, we think the close relationships the major watch retail chains enjoy with the watchmakers make the watch retailers resilient even during downturns and makes these retailers less prone to disruption by online retailers.
  Luxury watch retailing is a decent business with ROCEs in the 10-20% range on a group level including all overheads and after taxes, whereas store-level ROCEs on an EBIT level can be as high as 30-50%, for stores in HK at least. The biggest capital outlay when opening new stores is the watch inventory that they need to have ready for the customers, given typical inventory days range between 120-240 days. Atypical for most retail operations, these businesses are very working capital intensive; this fact lends them stability in downturns as they can monetize the inventory, thereby releasing cash. Based on our research, the average store in HK has turnover of around HKD150mn, generating EBIT of ~HKD15mn with average inventories per store of HKD50-75mn, although precise numbers can vary depending on the store size, brand mix, and point in the cycle.
  Unlike many other retail subsectors, luxury watch retailers tend to have a symbiotic relationship with the watch manufacturers which make the major luxury watch retail chains a lot more resilient compared to other retail formats. For the big watchmakers brand image management is of utmost importance, given that time measurement is frankly the least important function of a luxury watch. Physical retail has been an essential part of brand management as it provides a direct touchpoint between end consumers with the brands. Therefore, watchmakers exert a lot of control over its authorized retailers with regards to store design, enforcing strict no-discounting policies, but also providing support, e.g. by buying back unsold inventory. In our view, the very nature of luxury retail generally makes this subsector relatively more internet-proof because (i) buyers are generally less price or efficiency-focused, (ii) the purchasing process in itself is part of luxury process, and (iii) these high value items don’t lend themselves to existing shipping and returns processes.
  Recent Developments
VSD aside, we want to talk about the boom and bust journey that’s resulted in today’s overcapitalized balance sheet. As mentioned before, the biggest outlay when opening new shops is inventory, so when the company embarked on its expansion spree between 2010 and 2015 almost doubling its store count in Hong Kong from 15 to 29 stores, they tied up significant amounts of cash in inventory (~RMB700mn) for incremental stores that failed to turn a profit.  However, as they closed down these unprofitable shops and scaled down to today’s estate of 13 stores in Hong Kong, group level inventory levels are down to a still elevated but more reasonable 245 inventory days. Together with the VSD described in the next section, these stores closures culminated in the substantially overcapitalized balance sheet and improved group profitability.
  Liquidation Value
On a headline basis, at HKD 0.37, 3389 trades at a P/B of 0.35x. Having repaid all debts, 3389 has recently managed to turn a net profit too, which is helpful but immaterial for our investment thesis. Our liquidation analyses yield liquidation values close to book value of the shares around HKD 0.84 because of the company’s large cash holdings and watch inventories. Given the watch manufacturers would rather buy back excess inventory rather than see discounting, our sense is that even in a liquidation scenario, we will likely not need to see heavy discounting on the company’s RMB1.3bn watch inventory.
    Note: whilst the company reports in RMB, its shares trade in HKD.
  Related Party Transactions
This is always a very sensitive point for us and a real test of character for management teams as it is always very tempting to extract economics via off-market transactions. Whilst some acquisitions or business decisions may not have played out as one may have hoped, there’s been no evidence that Mr Zhang has been enriching himself at the expensive of minority shareholders. In fact, 3389 has started to return capital to shareholders via buybacks and dividends now that the business has been simplified and is recovering. The biggest transaction was the VSD by which 3389 sold its mainland China activities apart from the accessories manufacturing business and one investment property in Shanghai.
  Very Significant Disposal (“VSD”)
Over the years, 3389 expanded its business in China by a mixture of organic growth, acquiring majority stakes in regional Hengdeli businesses, and outright acquisitions or more or less related businesses. As the anti-corruption campaign unfolded, even the Hong Kong stores saw sales decline whilst newly opened stores in mainland China hardly turned a profit whilst absorbing a lot of cash to fund inventory for the new stores. This culminated in the VSD that was done at around 0.90x book value, funded with RMB3.5bn in cash, most of which was used to repay debt and to fund a RMB1.2bn dividend to 3389 shareholders.  We view these actions as fair and aligned with minority shareholders.



Risks
Lower import taxation regime: currently, HK watch retailers benefit from extraordinarily high import duties of almost 100% for luxury watches imported and sold in mainland China due to a mixture of tariffs, VAT, and consumption taxes. Once abolished or lowered, this will materially reduce the competitive advantage luxury watch retailers based in Hong Kong currently enjoy compared to those on the mainland.
  Rental costs: this is a perennial problem in Hong Kong where the rental system that greatly favors landlords over tenants. Particularly for prime real estate where luxury watch retailers tend to reside, rental levels tend to be high and can materially eat into profitability, which becomes especially acute when there is a sudden downturn and rental levels are not adjusted downwards in time. Hengdeli rents all its stores in Hong Kong, so is particularly exposed to this issue relative to peers.
  Watchmakers: whilst we don’t think the risk from a web-based direct selling strategy is very high, technically there is little holding back watchmakers from entering the retail business themselves, particularly for the multi-brand houses like LVMH or Swatch. In the scheme of things, the actual retailing activity isn’t excessively attractive from a financial point of view to make it worth the watchmakers’ time.
  Tech disruption: we’ve outlined some reasons why physical luxury retail is unlikely to be disrupted by pure-play online retailers, however, proliferation of smart watches is certainly a threat to the watch industry. For men in particular though, watches are almost more jewellery rather than fulfilling for time telling, but given much wider functionality of modern smart watches, it certainly poses a threat to the established watchmakers.
  Country / governance risk: whilst there is negligible FX risk given the nature of the products being sold and HK has good listing rules, one needs to bear in mind that Mr Zhang owns 34% of the shares. Based on his track record so far, we can say that he’s treated minority shareholders fairly, which is one of the reasons why we recommend this investment.

Investment Thesis:
Pendrell (PCO) offers SPAC-like optionality while trading at a discount to cash. Trading on the Pink Sheets, PCO is an illiquid cash shell trading at a -$22.8mm EV with 14.1% upside to cash. Additionally, after discussions with patent experts, we believe PCO’s patents are conservatively worth $25mm. A simple DCF on PCO’s NOLs after a potential acquisition leads us to a present value of ~$50mm. With a rough NAV of $260mm, PCO offers 62% upside with very limited downside, an incentivized management team, and a board with extensive telco history.

  How does management intend to use its cash pile?
Management’s stated goal is to use the cash to buy an operating company. We believe this is the best use of cash and will maximize value.  We modeled a hypothetical transaction using conservative assumptions (8x EBITDA, 50% leverage, 3% EBITDA growth, 15% cost of capital, and a 21% tax rate) and derived a NPV for the tax savings over the life of PCO’s NOLs of ~$50mm.
  We believe a transaction is likely to happen soon given the rationale for PCO going private was to appease potential targets who had no interest in being public. However, this thesis is not contingent on an immediate transaction as PCO still trades at a discount to cash, and management is keen on repurchasing stock so long as PCO’s discount to cash persists. The company repurchased 30,478 shares for an average price of 645/sh, a 3% discount to the current share price. Furthermore, G&A burn has been significantly cut by management to $7.5mm, so PCO will not bleed NAV as investors await a transaction.
  Many investors forget SPACs trade at a massive premium to NAV with the same use of proceeds. A generic SPAC post-issuance will trade at ~$10/sh while NAV/sh is only ~$7.60/sh (a premium of 32%!) when one accounts for ECM fees and the sponsor promote.
  Management and Board
  We believe Craig McCaw and management are excellent stewards of our capital. McCaw, the current Executive Chairman, holds an economic interest of 37.4% and voting interest of 67.6% through Eagle River. He has had a storied career in managing and investing in telco companies. McCaw served as Chairman and CEO of McCaw Cellular Communications from 1974 until he sold it to AT&T in 1994. With his AT&T proceeds, he invested $1.1B in Nextel which he eventually sold to Sprint. Following his involvement in Sprint, he founded Clearwire Corp which he took public and eventually sold to Sprint. We are confident in McCaw’s ability to execute an accretive transaction for PCO.
  Lee Mikles, the current CEO, pays himself a nominal cash salary and is instead compensated almost entirely in stock. In 2017, Mikles was paid $7,500 in cash and received a RSU grant of $626,000; he currently has $1.15mm of stock waiting to vest.

  There isn’t enough liquidity for institutional investors; however, investors looking for an attractive opportunity in their PA should look seriously at PCO.
     I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise do not hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

Potato did a great write up of the refiner Valero (VLO) in October 01 so I will not repeat the background. Rather, if you find his secular thesis attractive (recommended reading), I believe there is now a catalyst for the thesis.

Specificially, I believe the next 12 to 18 months should be particularly favorable for VLO's economics (as well as the other refiners) and worth looking at here. Refinery margins (i.e. crack spreads) are at very high levels -- and I believe likely to stay high for at least a year if not much longer. In fact, if you just plug the current forward curve into an income statement model for VLO, you will come up with earnings as high as $10/sh+. If your style cares about consensus, it is around half of that level. The major change since Potato's write up is the civil unrest in Venezuela. Venz is the most important oil partner to the US, in my opinion, due to their close proximity, rich reserves, and refining capacity. I believe the (understandable) focus on Iraq has diverted almost all focus from the Venezuelan situation, one of the most important dynamics in the petroleum world. They have gone from being a meaningful exporter to the US (around 250K barrels per day (bbl/d) of refined products to a meaningful importer (250K bbl/d) [only 5 day trip versus 45 days from persian gulf -- so much cheaper from Venz). This may not seem like a large amount in the context of the US daily requirements but on the margin it makes a big difference given the industry's very tight supply situation pointed out by Potato. The Chavez government has fired the large majority of the country's oil engineers (somewhere between 15K and 20K) and, even if they hired them back today (very unlikely), it could take a year to get their highly complex refiners back up and running properly. In fact, if the Chavez people try and start these complex refiners themselves, they are at high risk of blowing up and never coming back on-line (possible).

Moreover, in addition to the Venezuelan situation, Kuwait's refineries are reported to be operation 20% below normal level, although this is likely a temporary phenomenon. Another dynamic that is unconfirmed and likely temporary are reports that Iraq blew up an Iranian refinery on Monday. Neither of these are key legs to the catalyst but could be s-t positives.

The overall thesis here is that investors haven't realized the depth of the Venezuela problem and the impact it will have on US refinery margins. I believe investors will realize this over time as earnings are generated and it will be a catalyst for VLO and other refiners.

The key risk to VLO is that it is a business with high financial leverage, relatively high operating leverage, and an acquisitive management -- operating in a cyclical environment.

Thunderbird Entertainment is one of the more intriguing risk/reward situations I've come across in some time, and represents a high quality business with a strong competitive position, phenomenal management team and hidden optionality with the potential for massive upside, trading at a bargain basement price. The idea has been written up multiple times, and with respect to andrew152, his most recent writeup calling the stock 'a moderate risk/reward' fails to adequately capture the setup and potential asymmetry here.
The thesis is straightforward; Thunderbird is growing their top line 25%+ with a de-risked business model that is cash generative, and has strong relationships with every major streaming platform during a period of time where demand for content has never been higher. Furthermore, Thunderbird is at an inflection point within its business model which should have the effect of driving EBITDA growth and margin expansion over the next few years. Lastly, as a result of their industry position, it would be almost impossible to imagine that this business will not play a large role in the future of content creation over the next few years leading to potential multi-bagger returns for shareholders.
Thunderbird Entertainment can be viewed as a 'pick and shovel' way to play the current wave of demand for content, particularly animated children's content, providing investors with a way to take advantage of the current battle between streaming giants, as well as potentially participate in the hot M&A activity taking place across the film and television industries. Thunderbird is available at a discount price as a microcap (USD $160mm TEV) trading on the Toronto Venture Exchange (as well as US OTC exchange) with limited analyst coverage, somewhat obscure financials that don't fully reflect the earnings power or cash generation of the business (and therefore don't screen well), valuable assets on the balance sheet that have yet to be fully monetized, and low float given high insider ownership. In addition, management does not provide guidance and quarterly calls and presentations up to this point have been underwhelming in terms of communicating the story to investors. As mentioned above, I believe Thunderbird is at an inflection point both within their business and the industry where growth is set to explode moving forward, and additional catalysts such as an potential US up-listing, an M&A deal and potential steps taken to increase the float could materialize, while the strength of the business will continue to shine through. All of this is available at an estimated 4-6x base case 2023 EBITDA.
The Business
Thunderbird Entertainment Group is a Vancouver-based, publicly traded multi-platform entertainment company that creates scripted, unscripted and animated programming for global digital platforms, as well as Canadian and International broadcasters. In other words, they create high quality and award winning content for both TV networks and major streaming platforms. The company has an interesting history discussed more below, and has grown steadily since 2011, evolving from a 150-person studio primarily doing service work to a 700-plus person studio with three locations in Vancouver, LA and Ottawa.
Thunderbird has two divisions, Live Action/Scripted and Animated Content. Within their live action and scripted division, content is produced through their Great Pacific Media arm, and is made up of a combination of production service shows and owned intellectual property (IP) shows. Examples of content from the live action and scripted division includes Kim's Convenience, the popular Canadian sitcom as well as Highway Through Hell, one of the most popular reality shows in Canada, currently filming its 10th season. Within animated content, shows are produced through the Atomic Cartoons arm, and also consist of production service work shows as well as owned IP. Examples of content within Atomic Cartoons include Netflix's Hello Ninja (production service) and Last Kid's On Earth, the owned IP show adopted from author Max Brallier's popular children's book series. In addition to show production, Thunderbird also acquires, licenses and merchandises distribution rights for owned IP.
Within each division, Thunderbird has three different revenue streams consisting of production service work, partnerships and owned IP development. For production service work and partnerships, Thunderbird is hired by a network or streaming service to create and develop a show, and all costs of production are covered by the client on top of a fee paid to Thunderbird. For partnerships, all aspects of a project are outsourced to Thunderbird in exchange for Thunderbird retaining licensing revenue on the back end of that project. When it comes to owned IP, Thunderbird develops a piece of content themselves with full ownership of the IP, which they can then monetize via licensing, consumer products and other avenues of distribution.
Production services/partnership work currently makes up around 60% of revenues and sports 15% EBITDA margins, while owned IP work represents the remaining 40% of revenues but boasts double the EBITDA margins at 30%. In addition to Thunderbird retaining all ownership of their owned IP, this content is preferable to production services/partnership work as it can be re-sold globally into other markets given the long-tail.
An interesting element of studying Thunderbird's business and the industry revealed itself in terms of their industry positioning and competitive advantages. Typically, the movie studio business is a really bad business. With productions requiring cash outlays upfront for the high cost of talent and overhead, and the final product being subject to consumer demand, studios are dependent on ‘home-run’ blockbuster hits to drive ticket sales and licensing/distribution revenues across the world. Thunderbird’s strategy and business model insulate them from the unattractiveness of the movie business, as the company is primarily focused on 'hitting singles', while leaving the potential for a huge IP hit to materialize on its own. As a Vancouver based company, Thunderbird benefits from favorable working capital dynamics in the form of Canadian tax credits, which typically fund around 75% of production costs prior to staffing a show leading to minimal capital outlays upfront. Furthermore, Thunderbird pre-sells every single one of their projects, removing the risk of a ‘flop’ by locking in a guaranteed sale before production begins.
Digging further into these tax credits, Thunderbird works with their distribution partners to receive an allocation of funding for a particular project. Once they receive funding for a project, it unlocks tax credits which can then be leveraged to receive short-term financing for film production from a Canadian bank. With a set budget, timed schedules and partial financing, Thunderbird approaches their U.S. broadcaster to finalize agreements and determine financial participation before greenlighting a project. In return for funding, the broadcaster receives certain rights for sharing costs in the development. Throughout this process, Thunderbird has ensured they can best estimate the input costs, receive financing from a combination of parties, and know the base amount of revenue the project will earn before development. Essentially, Thunderbird works to cover the costs of development before starting a project, and with pre-set financing terms, Thunderbird can continue to develop the production slate and add to their collection of content assets, virtually risk-free. As Thunderbird creates more content, they will grow revenues and brand awareness while enjoying some operating leverage from an internal production team that has been executing at the highest level to date. This model has proven to be scalable, and could be potentially where investors are missing a lot of the value creation taking place as its difficult to understand the complete picture by analyzing the financials alone. This is incredibly different - and good different - from the movie studio business as a whole.
The above dynamic is significant as it de-risks the production side of things and also allows Thunderbird to take on projects not economically viable for US counterparts. While content creation itself has limited barriers to entry, replicating Thunderbird’s competitive positioning would require years of investments in talent, creativity and time, not to mention the reputation that Thunderbird has built as a reliable, high-quality producer of in-demand content. The downside to this model from the standpoint of being a public company is that owned IP project deliveries and revenue recognition can be quite lumpy, leading to non-linear results that can make the business appear less strong than it is. Thunderbird offsets the choppiness of owned IP work with the near-recurring, cash flowing production services work which helps smooth out results until the backlog of owned IP becomes so large that shows are delivered with greater frequency.
A good example of owned IP value creation includes the popular Netflix show Last Kids on Earth, a show created by Thunderbird which has three seasons running in addition to an interactive movie experience. Thunderbird was able to use their industry relationships to secure a meeting with author of Last Kid's, Max Brallier, and optioned the IP for a $10,000 upfront payment. The show is estimated to have brought in $25-30mm of revenues to date, and is currently being followed on by the licensing of various consumer products including toys and video games. Most importantly, the quality of the show and subsequent results have led to Thunderbird becoming a trusted partner to Netflix as well as the other streaming services, a competitive advantage that would be very difficult to replicate.
Today, according to management, Thunderbird's project pipeline and backlog is as full as its ever been given the incredible demand for high quality content, and they currently have over 50 projects in various stages of development, many of which are owned IP shows being distributed on the major streaming platforms such as Netflix, Disney+ and HBO Max.
Background
While the initial version of Thunderbird has roots dating back twenty years, the current version of the company starts around 2011. Since then, as mentioned above, Thunderbird has grown significantly, evolving from a 150-person studio primarily doing service work for content platforms to a 700-plus employee studio with three locations in Vancouver, Los Angeles, and Ottawa.
Thunderbird Entertainment was founded by former President and CEO Tim Gamble with the initial purpose of serving as a venture-capital like business that would help fund film and television productions. A pool of capital was initially put together and the group would invest in other people's ideas and content. For example, content creators would bring Thunderbird ideas with funding, but would need a bridge loan or production money to make the show, and Thunderbird would finance the rest. At some point the group decided to start producing their own content, which came with the aforementioned production development risk, but the turning point for Thunderbird came when Tim Gamble got a call from a director friend who wanted help making a sequel to the original Blade Runner. There was an opportunity to buy out the interests of a partner who didn't want to be involved, so Gamble contacted Lionsgate Studios founder Frank Giustra to help purchase the Blade Runner IP. Giustra agreed, but instead of buying the IP interest outright, Giustra suggested making an investment in Thunderbird as a shareholder, and purchasing the Blade Runner IP as an asset for the company.
The wheels for having Thunderbird acquire and produce valuable IP were set in motion, which also coincided with the growth in streaming services as well as the desire for the major cable networks to create their own platforms as opposed to selling their valuable shows to companies like Netflix. This in turn led to the start of in-house content development by these streaming platforms, but also given the demand, led to Netflix and others having to outsource content production to meet this escalating demand. Following the purchase of Blade Runner IP, in a fortuitous situation for Thunderbird, Australian producer/director Josh Wakely, who had dreams of creating a children's TV series using Beatles music, and had already secured the rights to 50 songs on the Beatles catalog, needed a production company to see his vision through. After embarking on an extensive search to find the right partner, he landed on Tim Gamble and Thunderbird which given the tax credit financing made an otherwise expensive project feasible. So Thunderbird acquired the rights to the project, sold it to Netflix pre-development, and found an animation studio to develop the show. Atomic Cartoons led by current Thunderbird CEO Jen McCarron was chosen, and some time later, Beat Bugs was born. The partnership between early Thunderbird and Atomic went so well, and the work was so good, that Gamble thought it would be in the best interest of Thunderbird to acquire Atomic. Most importantly, the series also cemented the early relationship between Thunderbird and Netflix which continues to bear fruit today. Following Thunderbird's acquisition of Great Pacific Media in 2014, the two divisions were born resulting in the Thunderbird that investors see today. In 2018, Thunderbird went public in via a reverse merger with Golden Secret Ventures, and started trading on the TSX Venture Exchange that year.
Business Strategy
Thunderbird now develops both scripted, unscripted and animated content, with a renewed focus on owned IP, especially within the animated content division. The aim is to build out a world class production studio in addition to an in-house consumer products and licensing arm which will allow Thunderbird to further monetize hit shows with licensing revenues from various consumer products.
With Atomic and the animated content division being the crown jewel of the business, the focus on kid's content and owned IP makes sense as it's both a subscriber acquisition tool and a churn reducer for the various streaming services. The pandemic provided a good example of this as TV, among other things became the babysitter for a lot of working parents. Today, there is an incredible amount of kid's content both available and in production and demand shows no signs of slowing down. According to management, the Kids & Family Division has an animation team of 800 people between 3 locations and is trending towards exceeding 900 people by the end of 2021. Furthermore, in 2015, Thunderbird had 18 bid requests for projects. In 2020, they had 67, and for FY21 they are on track for over 80 bid requests, which averages out roughly two a week.
From the latest call:
""The Kids & Family Division is busier than ever, and our bids and increase tripled year-over-year from January to October 2019 to January to October 2020. We've also added more than 400 crew members to our team on the animation side of the business to keep up with the demand. We are fully booked through 2021 and have visibility well into 2023.""
As Thunderbird develops more content, they are developing a collection of valuable IP which remains on the balance sheet as valuable (but hard to quantify) assets. Many of their kids programs in particular have much longer lifespans than the original content amortization periods. As a result, as they grow their library, the business becomes more attractive as an acquisition target for other companies while also creating the option for a valuable tent-pole piece of IP. In addition, with more bid requests flowing in, Thunderbird can dramatically reduce the content acquisition/origination cost which creates somewhat of a flywheel as the company’s ability to produce more quality content will attract even more bid requests and then more talent.
With a strong track record now solidly intact, Thunderbird has earned their great reputation throughout the industry with their quality of their productions and reliability as a content producer. These components are critically important given the significance of trust, value and relationships in the entertainment industry. I'd argue that the barriers to entry to replicate Thunderbird's industry position are incredibly steep. To get to a place where OTT providers trust you with millions of dollars and years of investments in time and creation, you need a great reputation and ability to execute. The pandemic provided a good example of this as during COVID, Thunderbird was able to transition nearly the entire staff to a remote work environment while not missing a beat with their clients, delivering on all commitments to their distribution partners as expected. In addition, with many in person shows and developments being cancelled or delayed, Thunderbird’s focus on animated content allowed their backlog of production work and IP creation to grow year over year. These factors have led to strong relationships with nearly all of the major streaming and content platforms in the media landscape, including HBO Max, Disney, Netflix, and Hulu, among others. These platforms would be hesitant to outsource an important piece of work to upstarts or new studios just to save a few bucks and the relationship with Netflix is paramount as its estimated that they control about 20% of the streaming market today.
Industry insiders have confirmed that your work and ideas are only as good as your relationships at the distribution level. But once that pipeline is opened up and a track record is developed, studios can find themselves in a situation where there is endless demand for new projects with major streaming services. Thunderbird has done exactly that. A strong example would be the Disney relationship. Thunderbird has worked with Disney for many years on various projects. Industry insiders confirmed that there may not be a more difficult client to work with than Disney in terms of Disney's expectations and particularity about their content and characters. This demand for quality is not only ingrained inside of the culture of Atomic Cartoons but has also been delivered on. Quality plus relationships are two very hard to replicate features of Thunderbird's current position.
While animated content and the potential development of a hit piece of owned IP will be a major focus moving forward, Thunderbird will also continue to emphasize service work to maintain their revenue growth and cash flows. This balance is important as it would be difficult for Thunderbird's model to be entirely based around creating owned IP given the long production times as well as occasional lumpy demand. Service work is margin driven and again provides the opportunity for steady cash flow as well as continued relationship building.
Long term, Thunderbird's aim is to have multiple owned IP projects in production with another large chunk of service work related projects in development through 2023. The company's backlog and project pipeline has never been more full, and Thunderbird will continue to expand their footprint in all areas of animation, live-action and factual content. A recent strategic move to build a studio in Los Angeles also bolsters Thunderbird's distribution potential, pre-production business and relationships with industry talent as Netflix and Disney showrunners are now a few doors down from Thunderbird.
Industry Info
As mentioned, Thunderbird’s current development pipeline is robust and growing, indicating the demand for content should provide favorable tailwinds into the foreseeable future. Industry reports estimate global content spend among the major streaming and media platforms to be in excess of $50 billion in 2021 alone (and projected to reach over $70B by 2025) with OTT subscriptions continuing to grow as well. While the growth in service-related work and IP licensing revenues are enough to generate favorable returns moving forward, Thunderbird has been focused on building an in-house consumer products and licensing division so that quality content can be followed up with consumer products leading to more licensing revenue. According to management, these investments in talent and sales should begin to bear fruit in 2023 and beyond.
Today, Thunderbird is constantly being approached by some of the top industry talent, validating this tiny studio’s reputation and opening the doors for the creation of even higher quality content. This is where the flywheel comes into play, because as Thunderbird scales, they will drive more creators to the company, leading to better content, leading to more distribution, leading to further talent and so on. The value chain from a high caliber piece of content lends itself to many winners, and this nonzero sum-ness has led to win-win relationships for Thunderbird and the creators, distributors, actors and end customers. Moving forward, I would have a hard time imagining that Thunderbird will not end up playing a pivotal role in the future of content creation given the secular tailwinds, their competitive positioning, low risk business model and quality content production.
In terms of Thunderbird themselves becoming an acquisition target by a larger studio or content platform, I believe there are several trends that could make that a possibility.
The most significant of those is the transition of viewers from traditional TV to online streaming services and the rise of OTT in general. The rise in streaming services as well as demand for content has attracted interest from all of Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Disney and others, and because the prices for various streaming services are more or less around the same, content will be the ultimate differentiator. This has led to the various platforms aggressively investing and re-investing to create their own original content as well as outsourcing production for other quality shows. More projects are also being completed as joint ventures, as synergies between content creators and distributors become apparent when each can focus on their own expertise. This highly-competitive marketplace where streamers battle it out for market share has created the strong demand for content. While smaller networks and companies in the past simply licensed their content to the streaming services, recent trends point more toward in-house content for each major platform being the focus. In other words, Disney will want Disney content for its streaming services, AT&T will want Warner Media content, HBO will use HBO content, etc. As a result, and while the streaming services continue to look for an edge over each other, the value of content production studios could spike as they turn into juicy acquisition targets.
And that's exactly what's happening.
A number of recent acquisitions within the industry point to the demand for all types of content and anything halfway resembling a 'brand' receiving monster valuations in M&A deals. These deals further highlight the valuation disparity between Thunderbird and many of the potential lesser quality studios. The most egregious example includes Blackstone acquiring a majority stake in Reese Witherspoon's production company Hello Sunshine (with only TWO shows on air and a small handful in production) for $900mm or an estimated 7x revenues. Thunderbird, with its established in-demand IP and enormous project pipeline trades for 1.4x next year's revenues.
If the current environment is a reflection of any sort of trend moving forward, M&A activity will likely push convergence and consolidation among companies to new levels, as merged studios bring together content libraries, capabilities, distribution, and value. It's possible that COVID accelerated the need for M&A as well, as some production halts have put a premium on established and existing content libraries.
Lastly, I think it would be fair to mention Lionsgate Studios at least as a target for where Thunderbird is aiming. It's also applicable given Frank Giustra's involvement. Lionsgate grew from a few hundred thousand in revenues to the world's largest independent film studio with a market cap of over $3.1B. Similar to Lionsgate, if Thunderbird can keep 'hitting singles', building relationships and growing the business, it would be possible for one of their IP owned shows to 'pop' creating tremendous value for shareholders.
Management
Jennifer Twiner-McCarron has served as Thunderbird CEO since 2016, following the acquisition of Atomic Cartoons. Thunderbird named McCarron president in June 2016. She joined Atomic as head of production in 2011 and has served as the lead on projects including Beat Bugs and Last Kids on Earth for Netflix. McCarron was hand-picked and urged by The Board to accept the CEO role in 2018, and since that time period has executed incredibly well. With her extensive background in TV production, distribution and branded content, she is the perfect fit for the role. I think it's rare to find a combination of good business executive, creative talent and operator rolled into one CEO, but I believe that's what exists with McCarron at the helm. I am thrilled to be investing alongside her and believe she is the right person to continue building the culture and lead the business forward. My biggest gripe would be she doesn't own enough stock. However, I view compensation as fair and don't see any egregious stock comp or options being granted, with incentive compensation tied to earnings performance for each division.
Frank Giustra, the aforementioned founder of Lionsgate Entertainment owns over 7.7mm shares or around 12% of the business, and has been involved with Thunderbird for over a decade. I view his presence and involvement as a positive. Lionsgate was founded to capitalize on the growth of the film industry in Canada, and produced low budget, high grossing hits such as American Psycho and Fahrenheit/911. Giustra is also knowledgeable about film and TV production in Canada, as Lionsgate at one time purchased Canada's largest film studio, North Shore Studios, where American producers and film companies came to shoot given the cheaper production costs in Canada. Thunderbird's current strategy relies on the same dynamics including favorable tax credits to fund productions.
I would describe Giustra's day to day involvement as minimal, but at the very least his presence, experience and knowledge could at least help Thunderbird avoid doing stupid things and his breadth of contacts have without a doubt led to some beneficial and lucrative relationships for Thunderbird. The parallels between early Lionsgate and Thunderbird are many, and if anyone knows how to scrap to build a small content and production business with niche, independent content, it would be Frank Guistra. Together, insiders own 30% of the business.
Valuation
Thunderbird isn't the most straightforward valuation exercise that I've done given the timing of show production and deliveries can cause results to be lumpy, but recurring service work has helped smooth results a bit and I believe there is enough here to at least lightly project revenues / EBITDA moving forward given past growth rates. Management doesn't provide formal guidance, only guideposts, and I actually believe this business would be better suited to report results once or twice per year as there is a lot of noise in quarterly results. As a result, both revenues and cash flow could look choppy moving forward, but the company has valuable content assets building on the balance sheet that can accrue to shareholders in the form of increased licensing deals / revenue.
Although Thunderbird can drive value as a standalone business, the company has been exploring accretive M&A opportunities which would contribute meaningfully to the bottom line, creative talent pool and IP catalog. Outside of that, as mentioned, I could imagine a scenario in which Thunderbird themselves become a strategic acquisition target given their relationships with major streamers, built in creative talent, cost effective operations, and huge project pipeline. In addition, two of the company’s largest shareholders have been involved for over a decade, and large shareholders in a low float, thinly traded microcap would need an avenue for exit which the public markets may not provide. Moving forward, increased IR efforts and continued execution should drive more eyes to the business and its attractiveness.
In a bull case scenario, I've estimated 30-35% growth in revenues through 2023 along with flat 20% EBITDA margins on the back of 30%+ growth in EBITDA due to COVID related project demand hitting the income statement as well as the continued shift from service work to higher margin owned IP. This would result in the company generating nearly $40mm in EBITDA by 2023, quite significant for a $160mm TEV business.
Bull Case
In the more conservative base case scenario, I estimate declining revenue growth rates below 30% as well as flat EBITDA for next year followed by an increase in revenues and EBITDA for FY23 on the back of new show deliveries and again increasing development of owned IP. In this scenario, I have EBITDA margins declining by 15% through 2023, a scenario I view as unlikely. This this scenario with a below market multiple of 11x 2023 EBITDA shares could still be worth greater than 100% of the current price.
Base Case
My bear case is highlighted by a severe decline in revenue growth rates as well as EBITDA margins on the back of a failed transition to an owned IP mix shift as well as elevated costs weighing on EBITDA margins. Using an incredibly conservative multiple of 8.5x 2023E EBITDA here I still arrive at a share price higher than the current valuation. The bear case assumes a complete deterioration of the business including none of the positive scenarios laid out above playing out. In other words, I believe a lot would have to go wrong for investors to lose money at the current price, indicating the attractive risk/reward here.
Bear Case
Notes
*EBITDA has historically converted to free cash flow at a decent clip, but the use of and timing of interim production financing (tax credits) payback makes FCF conversion lumpy year to year. 
*Not included in my valuation is the upside from any tent-pole IP being developed
*Not included in my valuation is any potential M&A deal where Thunderbird acquires a production company
*Consumer products and licensing buildout and associated revenues aren't included as part of the valuation
*They also don't disclose certain metrics including project completion data, service work 'churn' (how many old service projects roll off and are replaced by new ones), unit economics surrounding show delivery / cost and a breakout of costs of production.
I believe investor downside is protected by the strong balance sheet, cash flows, relationships with major streamers and the two largest shareholders who as mentioned, may need an avenue for exit or liquidation at some point. As noted, in an incredibly pessimistic scenario where revenue growth rates decline, EBITDA margins continue to deteriorate and the market is unwilling to assign a full multiple to the business, I still estimate a stock price higher than the current valuation. In addition, there is a significant amount of optionality here in the form of potential hit IP and M&A that aren't currently being factored in to my valuation. I'm optimistic about the setup here and positive risk/reward skew.
Risks / Mitigants
No data from the streamers - could affect licensing / distribution sales - every show distributed through a streamer provides a global audience for brand building and licensing opportunities
Management does something stupid - to date, there has been no evidence of this, and the current group is aligned with shareholders via stock and option ownership
Will never get a full multiple due to lack of 'tent-pole' - mitigated for reasons discussed above, with the optionality that a tent-pole is developed within the next few years
Hit shows or talent leaves - Thunderbird is acquiring and retaining talent while growing as opposed to the other way around
Tax incentives dry up or go away due to limited payback / revenue share - countries such as Canada are incentivized to deliver tax credits for job creation as well as fostering creative talent relationships within their own country
Consumer product buildout flops - this part of the strategy is not factored into my valuation and would only add to the top and bottom line in the form of high margin licensing revenues
M&A window dries up - for the reasons stated above I believe Thunderbird can continue to drive value as a standalone business
 I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

  Copart
  Overview
  What exactly does Copart do?
  Operates salvage auctions
o   Market Share by Units: KAR (40%), Copart (40%), Other (20%)
o   When a car is broken/old, you can do three things with it
  §  Scrap it: Break it down for commodity content
Salvage it: Strip it of any components still in working order (and then scrap it)
Repair it
  o   When do you Salvage it?
§  Residual Value = Pre Accident Value – Repair Cost; When Salvage Value > Residual Value, the car is salvaged.
  §  Although called “salvage” auctions, the destination for the cars sold at salvage auctions is really: Salvage (60%), Immediate Scrap (20%), Repair (20%)
  o   Sellers into salvage auctions: insurance companies, non-profit organizations, automobile dealers and vehicle leasing and rental car companies and the general public.
  §  Customer mix: GP per customer is fairly different. The highest gross margin per car is from franchise / dealers and the lowest is from charity cars, with insurance (the bulk of the business) and others in between.
  o   Buyers of salvage auctions: automotive body shops, rebuilders, used car dealers, automotive wholesalers, exporters, dismantlers, recyclers, brokers, and where allowed, non-licensed (public) buyers.
  o   Revenues for auctioneers come from many services, which are generally directly or indirectly related to both volume and transaction value of auction sales. Volume and transaction value of the underlying salvage market is the principle driver of auctioneer revenues.
  What does this mean all?
o   Copart is a salvage auction pure play, auction bidding is online only (vs both online and in person at KAR)
  o   Operates a minority of sales under a “principle” model (vehicle sales), where Copart itself purchases the vehicle prior to the auction, and then is the seller during the auction (accounts for ~10% of rev). This model is more common in Europe.
  o   80% US, international exposure primarily UK
  o   Listed in 1994
  o   Revenue growth rate  has historically been  ~10% (similar to peer KAR, although Copart accelerated in 2017 and further into 2018)
  o   High GPM vs main per (~50% vs ~35% at KAR) due to online only model
  o   GPM and EBITDAM benefit from operating leverage, increasing each year. KAR does not exhibit operating leverage.
  o   Minimal leverage at Copart (vs ~3x at KAR)
  Business Drivers
  Car Demand
  Driven by
Scrap metal prices: Largest exposure is aluminum which has rallied strongly in 2017 (>20%) & into 2018
Increasing demand for recovered parts: Recovered parts utilization (in part dollar terms) in repairs has grown from 27% in 2006 to 36% in 2016 (recovered parts are much cheaper than new)
  Strong dollar weakens international demand (~20% of purchasers), which has accelerated in 2018
  Used car price (relevant only for the minority of cars which are purchased with the buyer intending to repair and resell them)
    Car Supply
Traditional Channel (80-90% of auction volumes): Received from insurers after accidents – now shifting to higher margin dealers
  The most important supply volume driver is the loss ratio (% of cars decided to be salvaged vs repaired). The loss ratio is driven by the ratio of repair costs to used car prices, this has increased over the past few years as used car values have increased slower than repair costs.  Repair costs have trended up as vehicle complexity increases, as well as an increasing avg age of vehicles on the road.
     Repair costs increased at 3% over a 3 year CAGR from 2013-2016 (aided by a record avg car age of 11.6 yrs), compared to only a 1% increase in used car prices over the same period. In other words, repair costs are increasing faster than used car prices so the salvage opportunity is more appealing to insurance companies.  
  CPRT has taken advantage of this, volume processed by the company expanded by an average of 14.5% y/y for FYE2017 (ex-catastrophic and onetime events).
  Other drivers:
  Number of cars sold at salvage auctions = Miles Driven X Accident Rate X Salvage Rate
Miles driven growing at 3-4% CAGR since 2015, after being flat 2009-15, now 5% above pre crisis high
  Accident rate is flat at 2 crashes per million miles driven, as new safety features cancel out new electronic distractions
  Salvage rate had been flat at ~14% of cars in accidents over 2003-14, but has spike up to 17% over 2014-16. This has been driven by:
  Higher average age of cars (11.5 years in 2016 vs 9.5 in 2003, >7 year old cars have a >20% salvage rate vs 1-3 year old cars only at 5%)
Higher price of repairs (repair costs growing ~3% CAGR since 2008, never having dipped, driven by more complex vehicles and consolidation of repair shops from 45thsd in 2006 to 34thsd in 2014)
  Used car price has been increasing at a 2% CAGR since 2008, now 10% above pre-crisis levels, this is a headwind to volumes, as it makes repairs more attractive (if we indeed are at a peak, and pricing begins falling, this would be another tailwind)
  Other Channels (10-20% of auction volumes): 65% of the >10mln (10 year avg) cars deregistered each year do not end up at a salvage auction, most are simply scraped, despite being able to command a higher salvage price. Auctioneers now have marketing departments to work with charities/dealers/mechanics/individuals, to push some of these volumes into salvage auctions 
  Results  
  Last year
  Copart has grew its main service revenue by 16% y/y, an acceleration from its 11% 3 year CAGR. There are several drivers for CPRT, but the most important volume driver is the loss ratio (% of cars decided to be salvaged vs repaired) as repair costs have risen faster than used car prices, repair costs increased at 3% over a 3 year CAGR from 2013-2016 (aided by a record avg car age of 11.6 yrs), compared to only a 1% increase in used car prices over the same period. Repair costs are increasing faster than used car prices so the salvage opportunity is more appealing to insurance companies.  CPRT has taken advantage of this, volume processed by the company expanded by an average of 14.5% y/y in FY2017, aided by acquisitions and growth in market share as well as the overall market, with pricing increases fairly small y/y. On a year over year basis for 2017, the mix of customers has not shifted drastically, the company’s 10 year average of international buyers is 22%, below 2017’s of 20.1%.
  Recent data points
  Still good…
  Something however has changed in the past two quarters of 2018 (CPRT has a July FYE). Volume increases (ex-catastrophic events) are still fairly strong (9% y/y increase, volume from dealers is driving this). Beyond industry commentary we can see this in real time on Copart’s auction sites. From looking at their auction sites, not all cars sold are damaged. Copart also deals w/ cars that have ‘normal wear’ and ‘water’ damage. 
  Just one example: auction by a Honda dealer in Pennsylvania has cars that look new w/ only minor damages (if any) and in certain cases very few miles driven (i.e. one car listed I saw had only 8 miles driven and no noticeable damages).  
  https://www.copart.com/lotSearchResults/?free=true&query=hondaacurapa&intcmp=web_lotdetail_cds_pittsburgh_honda_acura
  If the auto retailers are encountering a big influx of used car volume (as Group One & others have publically said), and are using Copart to offload excess volume, this can be a positive volume driver for Copart (especially since this is the highest gross margin customer for Copart).
And even better…
  Pricing (ex- catastrophic events) has drastically picked up. For the last quarter (Q2’18) pricing increased y/y by 10% (Q1 was 14% y/y), a record increase in the recent past. Reasons why pricing has increased are strong scrap / value of crushed car bodies, a 16% y/y increase in Q2’18, with a reported Q2’18 y/y increase in used car prices of ~4.6-6% (depending on source), driven by a significant increase in bidders per unit, this includes international buyers which were up 42% y/y (a weaker USD helped).
    The recent jump in used car prices is the fastest in the company’s 10 year history, it would be concerning if this change was occurring faster than the increase in repair costs BUT it is not. On the Q1’18 call, the company called out a growth in the loss ratio of 7% over the last seven quarters, well above the last seven qtr used car price growth of 2.7% and above Q2’18’s 4.6-6% y/y growth and Q1’18’s 6.6% y/y growth, suggesting recent repair costs have grown faster than used car prices. A big part of the price increase has been the increase in commodity prices as well as the USD weakness, causing a jump in international buyers.
  Valuation
  Given the 1) strong increase in high margin supply from auto dealers from their own inventory management, 2) strong increase from international buyers due to the weakening USD and increased scrap value, and 3) consolidated market with very few players, we see Copart setting up nicely for H2’18.
  Today Copart trades at a 21 EV/’LTM EBITDA, 18.5 EV/’18E EBITDA (consensus) and a 16.5 EV/’19E EBITDA consensus. The company has historically traded at a LTM multiple of in the low teens.
  If we extend the dynamics from the first half of 2018, Copart trades at a 17.3 EV/’18E EBITDA, a discount just over 1x to expectations. Where Copart really works out is if the dynamic extends to 2019. If dynamics continue, Copart would trade at a 13.0 EV/’19E EBITDA valuation, a 3x discount to consensus and 1-2x discount to historic multiples, valued at 15-16x 2019E EBITDA would result in a stock price of $60-$63, compared to $51/share today. The company has a July FYE, as Copart exits 2018 and similar dynamics continue, we expect revisions to 2019 estimates.

Overview
Kirby Corp is the largest inland tank barge operator in the US and is cheap to normal while entering a cyclical upswing in its largest business. Before Covid-19, people started to notice the upswing and the stock hit a high of $92.30 (vs. today at $46.30). 
This is a decent but unspectacular business, and it hasn’t changed much over decades. Kirby is by far the largest tank barge operator, and scale advantages have let them compound book value per share by 14%, Revenue by 12%,  and EPS by 8% (where the end point is cyclically low) over the past 20 years. Barges are an extremely efficient method of transportation, and all the worries about things like driverless trucks running in convoys should not affect this business in the future. If anything, we will get a tailwind as shale gas continues to incentivize new petrochemicals capacity. 
Why is it cheap?
The tank barge industry goes through regular cycles. The last was caused by the massive crude differentials we saw as shale drilling took off. Because tank barges were one way to take advantage of that arb, the industry overbuilt and has had overcapacity since then. In the peak of the last boom (2014) Kirby’s Marine Transportation segment had operating income of $430mm (vs. $216mm in ‘19). This excess has been worked off. Utilization has trended higher in recent quarters, and the outlook for industry barge builds is low. 
Kirby also sells and services diesel engines. Because 60% of that business (by ‘19 revenue) is oil & gas related, that business is suffering and is expected to lose money this year. 
I’ll focus mostly on the tank barge business in this write-up because it accounts for 74% of EBIT in my mid-cycle scenario. 
Business Overview
Before I get into the segments, it is important to note that investors looking at recent results see a business split evenly between Marine Transportation, which is mostly inland tank barges but also coastal tank barges, and Distribution and Services. But these numbers reflect a cyclical low in Marine Transportation, and a number above mid-cycle for Distribution and Services. 
    Marine Transportation
Kirby operates tank barges on inland waterways to move chemicals, petrochemicals, agricultural chemicals, black oil, refined products and other liquids. Kirby is twice the size of the next largest competitor, and Kirby operates about 25% of total industry barges. 
  Scale brings advantages that have allowed Kirby to earn its cost of capital over a cycle. 
Scale advantages are as follows:
- Flexible horsepower: Kirby charters 1/3rd of its horsepower (tugboats) and can quickly lay off this horsepower in downturns. Small operators do not have the financial or reputational ability to hire charterboat operators because these operators would rather work for Kirby.
- Horsepower matching: because Kirby has a large fleet, they can match horsepower to towboat size and needs. As an example, they might match an 800hp towboat to a single barge in a canal, but they might use a 3000hp towboat for larger river movements. 
- Fleeting operations: Kirby has facilities that are basically parking lots for barges throughout the inland waterways. These locations let Kirby match capacity to need, stage river movements, and clean out barges if they change products. 
- Barge variety: tank barges are set up specifically for the products they are moving. Tanks might need to be heated or pressurized depending on the product. Most importantly, it is very expensive to clean a barge to allow a different product in it, and having a large fleet of tank barges lets Kirby avoid the expense of cleaning much more than smaller operators. 
- Barge utilization: large barge fleets let Kirby avoid the barge equivalent of deadhead miles. 
- Countercyclical asset acquisitions: Kirby has done a great job over the years in acquiring and building barges in times of industry stress. 
  Dry barges are much more fungible (they avoid the need to set up tanks for a specific product and the need to clean tanks) and for those reasons the dry barging business is worse than tank barges. 
  The business is now in a cyclical upswing, and the drivers for a healthy cycle are in place. The ability to build new barges is somewhat limited. Barge builder Jeffboat shut down, and Trinity (Arcosa now) shut-in capacity they bought from ACL. During the prior cycle the industry could build 300 units, but Kirby believes that might be less than 200 today. Demand is growing as well. Half of Kirby’s volume is petchem, and the petchem industry has expanded and will continue to as long as shale gas has an advantage. With that said, I’ll go through what the cycle could look like. 
  Here you can see the effects of utilization on contract renewal pricing:
  And here you can see utilization vs. operating margins: 
  Putting these together. I see operating income per ton mile moving well above 2 cents in the coming cycle: 
  In my valuation below, I assume 2 cents is mid-cycle. 2 cents per ton-mile is a 10 year average, and it also squares with new barge economics: if you assume a 30,000 barrel barge costs 2.5mm, a new tow costs another 2.5mm, and you run close to 4 barges per tow and 18.5mm ton-miles / year. 2 cents of operating income gives 9% returns on this capital, and that is for assets run at scale by Kirby. 
  Cash flow should at least match taxed operating income for the inland business. Kirby’s fleet is younger than usual, and maintenance capex shouldn’t exceed depreciation.
  Kirby also has a coastal tank barge business that had operating income over $100mm at the peak ($16.5mm in ‘19). My mid-cycle EBIT for this business is 1/10th of the inland business in my valuation, so I won’t go through it here in depth. Below you can see my margin assumptions for the coastal business:
  Distribution and Services
The distribution and services segment comprises 20% of my mid-cycle EBIT. The business is a distributor and servicer of engines and transmissions (Kirby is the largest distributor of on and off-highway Allison transmissions and the largest distributor of MTU engines) as well as the largest manufacturer and remanufacturer of frac equipment in the US. The oil & gas related parts of this business are getting killed right now. The following graphics from an investor presentation provide a good overview of end markets:
      Because this business is half of my mid-cycle EBIT, and because oil & gas is half of that, Kirby stock is not a bet on the recovery of pressure pumping in the US. I’ll also give some context around the $78mm of mid-cycle EBIT I use. 
In the 10 years before Kirby acquired Stewart & Stevenson in 2017 - which expanded the oil & gas business but also brought in more distribution for Allison, MTU, DTNA, EMD, and Deutz as well as rental equipment including generators and fork lifts - the D&S business did $38mm of EBIT on average. The acquired Stewart & Stevenson business did another $38mm of EBIT on average in the six years before the acquisition. In 2018 and 2019, segment EBIT averaged $116mm. So I think it is safe to say that mid-cycle is somewhere north of about $80mm. 
Note also that the Distribution and Services business is $960mm of my $4.9b valuation, and half of the EBIT here was acquired for $756mm. 
Valuation
Since this is the Value Investors Club, I’ll bust out everyone’s favorite metric, price-to-book, to start the valuation discussion. The following charts show P/B over the past 10 and 20 years for a business that is largely unchanged (some expansion in the Distribution & Services business but this is still mostly a barge business). 
  Book value is an appropriate metric for context here because Kirby’s earnings in the tank barge business are directly tied to the returns on the cost to build new barges and boats. On these assets, Kirby should earn a commodity return plus something for scale advantages. 
  Kirby looks cheap relative to its assets, but I mostly rely on a multiple of mid-cycle NOPAT for my valuation. For this I’m assuming 2 cents per ton-mile of operating income in the inland tank barge business ($302mm of operating income), about $27mm of operating income in the coastal business (vs. ‘19 OI of $16.5mm and a $117mm peak), and about $78mm of operating income in the Distribution & Services business. There is about $14mm of corporate cost, and I add back intangibles amortization of $16mm as well. Taxed at 25%, NOPAT is about $305mm, which at 16x gets you to a stock price of $59. Using today’s capital structure, that implies EPS of $4.40, or around 13x earnings. By this math, Kirby is an 80 cent dollar, but in good times people end up putting higher multiples on the stock. 
Risks
- The oil & gas portion of Distribution and Services is even worse than I contemplate. The business is losing money today and I’m effectively assuming about $40mm of EBIT in normal times.
- The up cycle in tank barges doesn’t last long.
  - Long term secular decline in petrochemicals leads to poor capacity utilization.

Elevator Pitch
GRWG is a cannabis-related stock that has been a ~5 bagger over the last year. At >40x ‘21E EBITDA, GRWG is priced to perfection despite the fact that I believe the Company will likely be net loser from Federal Decriminalization of cannabis. Insiders are voting with their wallets with >$85mm of net sales since the beginning of 2020 at an average price ~60% lower than current trading. Consequently, I believe GRWG offers a compelling risk / reward either as an outright short or hedge for other long cannabis exposure.
  Company Background
GrowGeneration Corp. (“GrowGen,” “GRWG” or the “Company”) is the country’s largest chain of hydroponic garden centers (the Company likes to think of itself as the “Home Depot for cannabis”). After several recent acquisitions, GrowGen operates 58 stores in 12 states (though over half of the stores are in CA, CO and MI). The average store is ~15k sf.
  GrowGen is effectively a roll-up or local hydroponic stores, having acquired 34 of its 58 stores since the beginning of 2020 alone. The Company acquires these stores or groups of stores for ~3-5x EBITDA, typically with a combination of cash and GRWG stock. GrowGen occasionally greenfields new locations as well. In addition to acquiring retail locations, GrowGen has also acquired a number of nutrient brands such as Char Coir and Canopy Crop Management as it has sought to expand its private label offerings and capture additional margin (the Company currently operates at a high 20s gross margins).
  The Company’s revenue mix consists of ~60% consumable products (e.g., nutrients and soil) and ~40% hydroponic equipment (e.g., lighting). GrowGen positions itself as a one stop shop cannabis cultivators of all shapes and sizes (though this has more to do with current law than a competitive moat). In 2020, ~25% of the sales were to commercial grow operations (i.e., MSOs and other large cultivators). However, it is no coincidence that the vast majority of the Company’s store footprint is in open license states such as CA, CO, MI and OK (as opposed to limited license states such as IL, OH, PA or NY), as cultivation in open license states tends to be significantly more fragmented with many small growers as opposed to a limited number of scale played.
    Short Thesis
  1.    Supplier Concentration / Disintermediation
GrowGen’s top two suppliers (who I believe to be SMG and HYFM) accounted for 41% of purchases in 2020 and the Company expects them to account for >30% of purchases in 2021.
  2.    Federal Decriminalization / Cannabis Banking Reform Will Hurt GRWG
Due to the prevailing interpretation of the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), large companies that have end customers in the cannabis business tend service them via a two-step distribution model to avoid selling to companies that touch cannabis.
  As a prime example, under current law, public companies such as Scotts Miracle Grow (“SMG”) and Hydrofarm (“HYFM”) will sell to retailers, like GrowGen, to avoid the BSA complications. Thus even large MSOs with enormous grow operations who want SMG or HFYM product would be forced to buy these products at retail from someone like GRWG.
  Were cannabis to be federally decriminalized, the argument that SMG or HFYM could not sell directly to a cannabis cultivator for fear of losing access to bank accounts would suddenly disappear. While SMG or HYFM might still find some value with having a retail presence to service small growers and hobbyists, it does not make industrial sense for either the MSOs or SMG for GWRG to continue to be a retail middleman that takes ~30 points simply due to the current legal structure.
  More likely I believe is a scenario where GRWG can still play an important role for the hobbyist grower while MSOs and other large cultivators buy pallet sized quantities directly from large suppliers. Additionally, I believe that when cannabis is decriminalized, it will spur significant industry consolidation both within and between states enhancing the presence of MSOs relative to small growers. The cumulative effect of this would materially shrink GrowGen’s addressable market.
  3.       Current Financials Include Significant Amount of Non-recurring SPend
Roughly ~40% of GrowGen’s revenue comes from non-consumables that a grower typically only needs to buy once before relatively long useful lives. When a state introduces recreational cannabis, new growers must buy new equipment to start growing. This grower capex spend benefits GrowGen when a state ramps legal production replace formerly illicit supply but is one time in nature. This dynamic can be seen in GRWG’s performance in Oklahoma, where 2020 revenue was ~$42mm vs just $0.5mm in 2018 largely on the back of this.
  4.       Priced to Perfection
Despite these potential headwinds on the horizon, at ~42x ‘21E EBITDA (or ~48x ‘21E EBITDA – SBC) the market is pricing-in considerable growth.
  I believe part of the reason for this GRWG is currently one of a limited number of US-listed ways to play the US cannabis space as most US MSO have their primary listing in Canada. I expect this dynamic to change over time, which could result in retail outflows.
        5.    Insider Selling
GRWG insiders have been selling in size over the last couple of years at prices significantly below where the stock trades today.
  Risks to Short
1.       Federal Decriminalization Never Happens
If cannabis is never decriminalized, it is likely that GrowGen would continue to hold an important place in the cannabis supply infrastructure similar to a beer distributor in current alcohol supply chain.
  2.       Roll Up Arbitrage Persists Longer than Schedule 1 Status
GRWG has been able to arbitrage its currently low cost of public equity capital to execute its roll up strategy. To the extent this dynamic continues before the Company experiences some of the headwinds mentioned here, it is possible that GrowGen could grow into currently stretched valuation.
  3.       Non Cannabis Strategic Wants Into the Space
  While highly unlikely, in taking a short position, one can never fully discount the possibility that a strategic (perhaps an HD or LOW in the case) blows you up.
I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise do not hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

NOA was last written up on VIC in the summer of 2017, and, while it has been an excellent performer since then, I think it warrants another look.  Down around 20% from recent highs achieved in September, and flat over the last year, I believe the stock is very interesting today. The company made a series of transformative acquisitions in late 2018, has already de-levered following these deals, will generate significant FCF in the second half of 2019 after a capex-intensive 1H, will generate even more FCF in FY 2020 (a ~20% yield on the equity), and will likely resume their buyback in size in 2020, after pausing it for the most part this year (again, due to maintenance capex requirements following the acquisitions of 2018).  (Note: the share price refers to NOA.TO traded in Canada, and all $ metrics in this write-up are in C$ unless otherwise noted, as the company reports in C$. The stock also trades under NOA on the NYSE.)
Background
As the company describes itself, “North American Construction Group is one of Canada’s largest providers of heavy construction and mining services. For more than 60 years, NACG has provided services to large oil, natural gas and resource companies.”  Though this simplifies it too much, a big part of what the company does is move earth around in big trucks. They own and provide the equipment to their customers, but also schedule and operate it. NOA owns over 600 assets (rigid frame trucks, loading units, dozers, and 20+ recently acquired ultra-class trucks).
Major customers include the Oil Sands companies (Suncor, Syncrude, Canadian Natural Resources), as well as mining conglomerates like Teck Resources, Rio Tinto, Newmont, Ivanhoe, and various government entities.
The company claims that 90% of its revenue is recurring; a notable recent contract win was five years in duration.  Contractual backlog provides committed revenue of $1.4bn over the next five years (and has been run-rating at about 50% of annual revenue recently).  Oil sands projects are fairly low cost globally, and should operate consistently with oil above $40, and perhaps below.
The economics of moving dirt around in Canada are surprisingly decent.  The company expects a double digit ROIC in 2019 and a 21-23% ROE. EBITDA margins are in the low-mid 20% range. 
2016 – 2019E ROE (per company)
The company has been working to diversify their revenue away from solely oil sands projects.  They recently won a coal mine contract in Wyoming, have been bidding on precious metals mine contracts in Canada, and have been pursuing large earthworks projects in the infrastructure sector (flood diversion, road building, etc).
2018 Transformative Acquisitions
November 1, 2018 – $43mm for 49% ownership in Nuna Group, a civil construction and mining contractor.
November 23, 2018 – $200mm asset purchase of heavy construction assets from Aecon Group, which removed a key competitor from the market, will drive over $200mm of annual revenue (at expected 25%+ EBITDA margins), and allowed for the formation of the Mikisew North American Limited Partnership (an oil sands JV).
The company financed these transactions with cash on hand as well as new borrowings (primarily a credit facility, but also a second convert).  The company’s average cost of debt is 4.7%. Due to strong free cash flow generation and significant growth in EBITDA, the company will de-lever rapidly following the November, 2018 acquisitions.
Management
A key part of the investment thesis is the quality of the CEO and management team.  The track record since CEO Martin Ferron joined in 2012 is very impressive. Through a very difficult oil market backdrop, he improved margins, grew the business meaningfully, de-levered (and recently re-levered for a large deal), and has grown the earnings power of the business astronomically.
He has proven adept at growing organically, acquiring companies and assets (inorganic growth), as well as improving operations to enhance margins.  My sense from the research that I have done is that customers are very happy with NOA, and would like to give NOA additional work (the company’s foray into operating ultra-class trucks on behalf of oil sands customers is an example of this).
This management team understands capital allocation, and I believe is likely to create value over the long term.  Each element of organic growth, M&A, and share buybacks have been value accretive.
The company has repurchased 15mm shares since 2013 (at an average price of ~$5-6), compared to the current share count of 25mm.
Given the quality of management and especially CEO Ferron, I think it is notable that he sounds as optimistic as he does about the prospects and current valuation.
 “I would like to start this call by stating emphatically that I could not be happier with the way things are going at NACG. Despite all the headwinds blowing at us by the macro environments, we keep finding ways to improve our performance, even in the toughest of overall industry times. Just imagine, what we will be able to do when these headwinds finally abate.” CEO on 2Q 2019 Call
I would be fairly skeptical of this coming from many CEOs – yes, it sounds a bit promotional – but Ferron is genuine and I believe he is the real deal.  This is a good segue into a discussion on valuation and various future scenarios.
Valuation and Scenarios
The adjusted (for an in-the-money convert) market cap is ~$410mm, and the company has ~$340mm of net debt (also adjusted for said convert), bringing the enterprise value to $750mm.  NOA should do over $175mm of EBITDA this year and over $200mm next year (just on growth from in-place equipment at YE2019). 
The company is trading for 4.3x 2019 EBITDA and 3.7x 2020 EBITDA.
Here is the 2017 – 2020E EPS trajectory:
$0.31                  $0.99                  $1.6-1.90                           $1.90-2.30
The business is currently trading for 8x the mid-point of the 2019 EPS guidance, and 6.7x the midpoint of the 2020 guidance. 
-          Despite the fantastic stock-price performance over the last few years (up 175% since Spike’s write-up in the summer of 2017), the EV/EBITDA multiple is almost exactly the same depressed value it was when the stock was under $5, and the P/E multiple is almost half of what is was at that time. 
-          On 2020 EBITDA estimates (by the company, which have generally proven anywhere from slightly conservative to vastly conservative), the company is trading at a 3.7x EV/EBITDA multiple (on the 2Q2019 balance sheet – ie, I’m not giving them credit for any future deleveraging, which is happening rapidly).
-          Using a 5x multiple on 2020 EBITDA, the stock price would be $22 (+57%), and at a 6x multiple (still the low end of where many peers trade), the stock price would be $29 (+107%).  Neither of these scenarios give them any credit for FCF generation between 2Q 2019 and YE 2020, which should be substantial ($100-150mm depending on growth capex, or $3-5 per share).
-          I believe a reasonable downside case would be a 3.5x multiple on the  low end of the company’s 2020 EBITDA estimates (again still giving them no benefit of the doubt on cash flow generation post 2Q-2019), which would put the stock at C$11 (-21%). 
-          The company’s guidance of generating $70-100mm of FCF in 2020 is around 20% of the current market cap.  If we assume all FCF is used to reduce debt, a 3.5x EV/EBITDA multiple using the low end of 2020 EBITDA guidance and the YE2020 balance sheet would put the stock at $15.50, slightly higher than where it is currently trading.  Said another way, the current multiple will drop from 3.7x 2020 EBITDA (on the 2Q 2019 balance sheet) to around 3.1x 2020 EBITDA (on the YE 2020 balance sheet) if the company just applies all FCF to debt reduction over the next 18 months.
-          Of course, none of these valuation scenarios contemplate further accretive M&A or share buybacks, the latter of which are particularly likely in 2020.  The blue-sky case three years out is a $50-60 stock on $250mm of EBITDA, 20mm shares outstanding, $250mm of net debt, and a 5-6x EBITDA multiple (which doesn’t seem heroic).  Again, this is coming from a CEO who took EBITDA from $63mm in 2017 to $200mm+ targeted next year (based on a brief increase in leverage that will be paid down in <3 years). This CEO and management team deserves a savvy capital allocation premium, not the steep discount that they are afforded.
Share Count and Ownership
“As at July 26, 2019, there were 27,345,572 voting common shares outstanding, which included 1,656,144 common shares held by the trust and classified as treasury shares on our consolidated balance sheets.”  Thus, the latest net share count was 25.7mm shares. The company has two issues of converts outstanding. $40mm which converts at $10.85 (I have treated these as if converted and increased the share count by $3.6mm and reduced net debt by $40mm) and $55mm which converts at $26.25 (which I include in debt and do not adjust).
Cannell Capital owns 11% of the company, and the CEO, Martin Ferrin, owns 6.1% (over $20mm).
Conclusion
I believe this opportunity exists because Canadian energy stocks (and indeed seemingly all energy stocks, for that matter) are out of favor.  But NOA has fairly little leverage to oil prices (at least within a reasonable band of say $40-70), and solid growth prospects over the coming years that are independent of commodity prices.  The CEO is good, and if NOA keeps trading at under 7x earnings and close to a 20% FCF yield, I expect we’ll see meaningful buybacks over the next few years.
I’ll conclude with another quote from the CEO, which I think clearly demonstrates how he is thinking about that topic:
“Those of you that have listened to me for a while, I affirm you wish it was 6 multiple on many occasions, but I honestly did not mean for that to be our EPS multiple. I really hope that the excellent Q2 results we have now posted provide an inflection point for our stock price performance, as we have delivered on the lofty post-acquisition expectation as we set. But if that does not prove to be the case, I'm sure that we will have some constructive Board discussions, both allocating our cash flow between deleveraging, stock buybacks and a dividend increase. After all, we should have sufficient cash flow to meaningfully do all three.” (CEO on 2Q Call)

2020-02-16,Wrangler,BIP,BROOKFIELD INFRS PTRS LP,https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/BROOKFIELD_INFRS_PTRS_LP/3855867588,22591000000.0,55.45,"Description
Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (BIP) owns and operates a globally diversified group of utility, transport, energy, and data infrastructure businesses that generate stable inflation indexed cash flows. BIPs largest assets include rail networks in Southwest Australia, Brazil, and North America; toll roads in South America and India; ports in the UK, Australia and North America; transmission lines in Brazil and Texas; natural gas pipelines in Brazil and North America; distributed energy systems in North America; cell towers in France, New Zealand, and India; fiber networks in France and New Zealand; data centers in South America; the largest metallurgical coal terminal in the world; and over 3 million UK utility connections.  
Given the level of long-term interest rates and the quality of BIPs assets, I believe it’s too cheap at a 4% distribution yield and ~20x run rate AFFO.  With 30-year treasuries yielding roughly 2%, why should a business with 95% regulated (or long-term contracted) revenue indexed to inflation with volume upside and a long runway for a capable management team to continue deploying capital at 12-15% returns yield 4%?    
BIP targets 3-4% organic growth from inflation indexation and 1-2% organic growth from real GDP growth (more traffic on its toll roads, more containers moving through its ports and rails, more gas traveling through its pipelines, etc.). These are pretty high certainty long-term assumptions in my opinion.  It’s important to note that these targets don’t imply management is banking on 3-4% global inflation; revenue is indexed to inflation, but (a) these are levered assets and interest costs don’t increase at all with inflation and (b) operating costs usually don’t quite increase by the level of general inflation either (a utility connection in the UK has very little cost to service once installed, as an example). 
Management also targets retention of 15-20% of AFFO to reinvest in the business at 12-15% returns for high-certainty incremental capex projects like widening toll roads, expanding transmission lines, or building out new connections in its distributed energy business. This should easily add 2-2.5% to AFFO growth before any M&A is considered.
Between this inflation indexation, volume growth, and organic reinvestment in the existing assets, earnings should grow annually by 6-8.5%.  But Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) gets IDRs equal to 25% of the growth in distributions, so that 6-8.5% turns into 4.5-6.5% growth net to the BIP unitholders. 
So before considering M&A, BIP unitholders get a security with very stable, bond-like cash flows yielding nearly twice the 30-year treasury rate that is inflation protected and likely to grow by 4.5-6.5% providing a total return of 8.5-10.5%.  That on its own seems like an attractive security to me in today’s rate environment and likely to outperform the S&P by a couple hundred basis points or more over time. 
But there is also significant upside from continued M&A at attractive returns. I think BIP can continue investing ~$1.5B/year (consistent with the last few years) in acquisitions at target returns of 12-15%, which they have achieved on their cumulative M&A history. I think it’s more likely than not that BIP can continue acquiring assets at attractive returns given their experience, track record, and scale. Infrastructure is where BAM has its longest track record, where relationships matter most because many of the sellers are government entities who care about the buyers operating expertise, and where there's more synergy potential and underwriting knowledge gained from owning nearly $60 billion of infrastructure assets around the world.  
Historically BIP has issued equity to fund M&A; but, now that they have a more mature business, they’re able to instead recycle mature assets that don’t need as much operating expertise at 6-10% yields to fund new higher growth investments.  If they can sell $1B of mature assets (below run-rate in the last couple years) annually at 8% yields (similar to recent sales) and buy $1B of assets annually at 12% IRRs (below long-term averages), that adds another 2.5% net to the unit holders. 
So, assuming:
 1. BIP assets grow organically with inflation + real GDP;
      2. BIP can continue reinvesting 15-20% of AFFO in company average ROIC organic growth          projects; and
      3. BIP can sell $1B of mature assets at 8% IRRs and reinvest at 12% IRRs,
  then BIP should earn unitholders a total return of 11-13% over a long-term holding period consisting of a 4% distribution yield and 7-9% distribution growth, which is the high end of managements target 5-9% range that they have handily beaten since inception in 2008 (10% CAGR). 
Furthermore, with 30-year treasuries yielding 2% and negative rates in many other parts of the world, I think it’s more likely than not that the distribution yield falls over time. Any re-rating of the distribution yield would be further upside to the 11-13% returns I believe unit holders can expect on yield and growth in distributions.
  I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

  How Wintrust got Here
Wintrust was founded in 1991, starting with a single branch, by three people who are still there: the straight-shooting CEO Ed Wehmer, the Chief Operating Officer and the Chief Credit Officer. At the time, community banks were getting bought out quickly by the big banks and the founders felt that the supply of community banks was shrinking too much compared to underlying demand. The company gradually grew both organically and via acquisitions, until 2006, when they realized the market was too crazy. Not wanting to lower their standards like their competitors or take unnecessary risks, they survived the crisis quite well (profitable in 2008). After 2008, they had the chance to acquire several banks via FDIC deals. Since then there’s been more strong growth, again via a combination of both organic and M&A. In 2020 things have not been too bad. They were able to distribute PPP loans faster than others and picked up 1000 new customers in the process. Today Wintrust has 180 branches mostly in the Chicago area (northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin), divided across 15 bank charters under their holding company. The 15-charter setup allows them to offer their MaxSafe deposit account, which provides customers the ability to have up to $3.75 million in FDIC insurance (a tranche of $250,000 x 15 banks – they do this under the hood of course; to the customer it’s one account; more details here: https://www.wintrust.com/business-solutions/mid-market/banking/maxsafe.html)
Through this ongoing growth, Wintrust is continuously adding to its edge by using a dual strategy of being community-oriented in all customer-facing aspects of the business while taking advantage of its scale to implement things that are otherwise only found at big banks. This manifests itself in many ways.
Community-Oriented Service:
- Community-oriented culture perpetuated in all aspects of the business; all marketing is produced in an internal agency so as to conserve this culture
- Smaller branches, smaller lines, longer interactions. Reserved spaces in the branch for specific needs like mortgages and businesses.
- Minimal ""nuisance fees"". They even have a plan in which they reimburse customers for their out-of-network ATM fees, effectively giving them the largest ATM network in the world (..will be tied in #1 position with anyone else who’ll choose to do this)
- Hosts financial education courses for people in specific life situations where finances change
- Present at various community events around the year
- Management of acquired banks stays in place: relationships with customers are maintained
- Each acquired bank keeps its name to reflect that continuity
- Accountability down to the lowest level across the organization to keep everyone involved
- No desire to expand geographically for no reason; strong preference for continuing to take market share in Chicago. [ they do believe however that in terms of physical locations, once they reach a ceiling, they could go to northwest Indiana, north Wisconsin, St-Louis or Minneapolis ]
Big-Bank-like Scale:
- Friendly service through technology: they have a 24-hour contact centre with the ability to see the person you're talking to
- Everything that doesn't touch the customer is consolidated for all the banks; this implies a lot of quality IT infrastructure; one system for all 15 banks. The company puts a big emphasis of staying on top of tech and is thus able to compete with big banks on that front.
- User interface of customer-facing tools is sophisticated and competitive with big banks
- Acquisitions are integrated professionally
- Product breadth significant enough to compete effectively with larger banks
- Able to provide larger credit facilities than smaller competitors
- Easier to attract talented staff
- Access to public capital markets
In 2008, Wintrust decided to implement the brand image of “Chicago’s Bank” because they were accumulating so many banks in Chicago, and believed that branding around one city will still be perceived as ‘local’ compared to the big banks. The new effort would would put the holding company’s name (Wintrust) in the spotlight. First, they implemented a two-brand identification strategy – keep each community bank’s name in place but add a tag line: “part of the Wintrust Community Banks family”. Then, they created partnerships with a lot of Chicago brands and institutions including major sports teams, colleges and charity boards. Similarly to the “Chicago’s Bank” branding, they added the “Wisconsin's Bank” branding as they expanded in Wisconsin. They now have the largest deposit base in Chicago among locally headquartered banks.
The company is patient and opportunistic with M&A, waiting for good valuations and focusing on organic growth whenever it’s expensive (like now). Asset growth is outpacing branch growth. They also have a history of buying back shares when that was an attractive option. Either way, more M&A opportunities should come. Community banks in metro areas are finding it hard to survive due to a tough regulatory environment, difficulty in getting good assets, in accessing capital and in trying to offer the range/quality of products that Wintrust offers. Wintrust is an acquirer of choice for them: they keep the all the top people that are familiar with the community (big banks would fire them) and so the entrepreneurial spirit and relationships remain while more/better products help the acquired bank do even better. This constant stream of small, bolt-on acquisitions over the years has led to Wintrust building a successful formula for integrating these banks and being known as a consolidator.
  Segment Breakdown
Wintrust reports in results in three segments: Community Banking, Specialty Finance and Wealth Management. Funding is 97% core deposits. Brokered and wholesale funding are only used to the extent necessary to manage liquidity and interest rate risk.
    FY2019 Net Income (thousands)
Community Banking
$238,498
Specialty Finance
$89,436
Wealth Management
$27,763
  Community Banking
The banking segment’s clients are similar to any typical community bank except that Wintrust can reach a bit higher in terms of size/types of clients due to its size and capabilities. There is great emphasis on conservatism, diversification and qualitative factors when judging potential borrowers. Over the years, charge-offs were always less than their peer group.
Their basic offering consists of:
- Full suite of consumer lending and C&I lending
- Mortgage production (retail origination and correspondent lending, VA loans): all in the U.S., 60% in the Chicago area. Certain loans are sold but servicing remains with Wintrust
  Specialty Finance
Wintrust has entered lots of niche businesses including:
- Community Advantage: lending, deposit and cash management services to condo/housing associations
- Mortgage warehouse lending to brokers in the Chicago area
- Franchise lending
- Direct leasing and lease financing
- Asset-based lending for mid-market companies
- SBA Lending
- Commercial mortgages and construction loans
- Financial solutions for local government organizations as well as hospitals, non-profits, and educational institutions
- Premium finance: FIRSTInsurance Funding finances commercial insurance premiums, First Insurance Funding of Canada does the same in Canada, and Wintrust Life Finance finances life insurance premiums
- Tricom: AR financing, payroll funding and processing, and outsourced back office administrative services
The company's priority is always their local markets, so to the extent some of these niches involve business outside that area, they are only used to top off the balance sheet. Premium finance is ~30% of the balance sheet and commercial loans (both specialty and non-specialty) are ~50%.
  Wealth Management
The wealth management segment comprises four businesses and $23 billion in AUM when excluding assets owned by Wintrust itself. The clients mostly consist of the bank’s customers but they do provide certain services to others. Services include asset management, full-service broker-dealer and 1031 exchange services. One point worth mentioning is that they bring the same values to this segment as the bank: For example: their high-net-worth segment will treat the $2-3 million portfolio the way a bigger bank would treat the $20 million portfolio. Another example: they cross-sell the services between segments in a manner where they’ll truly get to know customers and their needs, like a small business owner who needs help with wealth management.
  Recent Developments
A couple of interesting recent developments worth mentioning:
- They are starting to look at banks with over $1 billion in assets for M&A. Is this a good thing? If the price is right and the target in the area, why not? They have a lot of experience integrating acquisitions. The more annoying thing is that with the stock trading so cheap, they don’t have a strong currency. They’ve recently reiterated that they always compare M&A with share buybacks though, so I trust them to keep allocating properly.
- Buybacks were suspended in Q1 due to the virus; under the right circumstances I’m sure they’d restart them
- In Q2 they grew total loans by $3.6 billion – almost all PPP lending – this is now 11% of their loan book.
- The premium finance businesses are growing well this year, in part due to hardening market.
- In Q2, they issued some preferreds
  Valuation
So we have a company that has been profitable for 2 decades including in 2008, careful lenders, excellent capital allocators willing to buy back shares, good at growing organically and non-organically, with excellent operations in every aspect, clearly loved by their customers in terms of satisfaction scores and referral numbers.
Their tangible book CAGR of 8% since 2009 has outperformed the peer group and so have all kinds of other metrics.
The stock is at $59.25 compared to tangible book of $51.70
I think in this market, particularly if we see a value-growth rotation, it’s a great entry point. Also bear in mind that they don’t give guidance so opportunities might be generated that way as well.
 I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.

    GBL would be a PFIC (Passive Foreign Investment Corporation), thus for U.S. investors, this would only be suitable for those electing to take a mark-to-market election each tax year or who are utilizing their retirement accounts. In the case of retirement accounts, the 30% withholding tax on foreign dividends can be pared in half (see below). Please consult your own tax advisor. 
GBL trades under the Belgium ticker GBLB BR, as well as U.S. ADR’s GBLBY and GBLBF.
  Dividend and Consolidated Net Cash Earnings:
Obviously, dividends are only a small part of the valuation, as GBL’s holdings are increasing in value over and above their distributed dividends. However, it is a good place to start, using 2019 figures for normalization.
GBL’s 2019 gross dividend was €3.15 per share, equivalent to a current 3.8% dividend yield. In 2019, cash earnings, which mostly resulted from net dividends on listed investments, produced €595M—this would reflect a 4.3% cash earnings yield. Consolidated net results, including an investment division’s gains offset by losses in earlier stage businesses and other impairments, produced €705M in 2019. $705M/1.3B market cap = 5.3%.
  Withholding Tax Refund:
For U.S. investors, completing form W-8BEN allows your dividends to be taxed at the 15% treaty rate rather than the full 30% withholding rate on dividends. If you don’t complete this form in time, you can request a refund via your US income tax refund by utilizing form 1040NR. A good guide to reclaiming withholding tax on foreign dividends is available at this link: https://the-international-investor.com/investment-faq/reclaiming-withholding-tax-foreign-dividends.
  Capital Allocation:
GBL has had a major strategic redeployment of capital since 2012:
€10.1B in disposals, including €6.3B related to the exit from the energy and utility sectors
€9.6B in investments, including:
€5.9B in the consumer goods and business services sectors, 
€1.4B invested in technology group Umicore and GEA, and 
€1.9B deployed in Sienna Capital
Sienna Capital is GBL’s alternative asset platform which invests via 9 external asset managers into 18 funds and more than 150 underlying operating capital. At year-end 2019, it had already realized proceeds that represented more than half of its cumulative capital invested. 
GBL also appears to have an annual 2% share buyback re-authorization.
In 2019/20, they continued to have significant disposals and investments:
Sold €771m of Total for a €411m capital gain
Sold €499m of adidas for a €333m capital gain
Sold €499m of LafargeHolcim for a €106m capital gain
Acquired a majority stake of 64.7% in Webhelp for €867m
Acquired a block of shares in SGS for €374m
Made additional commitments, investments and disposals putting Sienna Capital at €1.8B NAV
This ongoing capital redeployment has resulted in greater industry diversity and a geographical mix that is now evenly distributed between Europe, Americas, and the rest of the world.
It has also resulted in the portfolio being dominated by investments in companies with leading positions in their sectors:
GBL is also typically the primary shareholder with board influence and engagement:
GBL is the primary investment vehicle of the Frère and Desmarais families, with Paul Desmarais, Jr. as Chairman and Gérald Frère as Vice-Chairman. Admittedly, Groupe Bruxelles Lambert is one of a half-dozen European holding companies that are trading at a discount to its holdings:
That being said, in the last year, GBL has cleaned up its ownership structure by taking out an intermediary ownership entity, paying a premium to do so: https://www.pargesa.ch/titres-pargesa/exchange-offer-offre-dechange/
This removed the Swiss intermediary holding company Pargesa S.A.:
While this is not necessarily an indication that this new generation of both families is ready to close the valuation gap, it probably tips the story in favor of preferring GBL to its other European discounted holdco peers.

MOD – Investment Thesis
April 2019
Situation Overview
Modine Manufacturing Company (“MOD” or the “Company”) has historically been a manufacturer of heat transfer products serving the automotive, commercial vehicle and off-highway vehicle markets.  Over the past seven years, the Company has completed two acquisitions which have dramatically shifted its mix of business from 9% industrial in 2012 to 47% industrial today.[1] The industrial business primarily serves the commercial HVAC market.  On January 29, 2019 the Company announced its intention to divest its auto heat transfer business. Following the divestiture, the business mix will be 39% vehicle and 61% industrial. We believe the Company trades at a substantial discount to its SOTP value after giving effect to the proposed divestiture.  We believe the auto business divestiture serves as a catalyst to re-rate the stock.
Overview
We recommend Modine Manufacturing Company as a long with a target price of $19.44 (~30% upside).
Modine, headquartered in Wisconsin, is a provider of thermal management systems and components to automotive, commercial and off-highway vehicle, industrial and HVAC markets.  The Company operates through three segments[2]:
The Vehicular Thermal Solutions (“VTS”) segment (47% of PF LTM 12/31/18 revenue) designs powertrain and engine cooling products for end users in the automotive, commercial vehicle and off-highway vehicle markets.
Within the VTS segment, demand for auto customers is driven by longer-term changes in fuel efficiency standards, in-vehicle technology enhancements and growth in emerging markets.  The auto business is currently being divested. Demand for commercial vehicle customers is driven by growth in heavy-duty and medium-duty trucks, changes in emission standards and vehicle efficiency.  Demand for off-highway customers is driven by production of agriculture, construction and mining machinery which are generally tied to macroeconomic conditions in each respective end market.
The Commercial & Industrial Solutions (“CIS”) segment (41% of PF LTM 12/31/18 revenue) designs coils, coolers, and coatings for end-users in the heating, ventilation, air conditioning, refrigeration, data center and broader industrial end-markets.  Management estimates that roughly 2/3 of CIS sales are related to replacement products, with the balance related to new construction.
Demand for the CIS segment is driven by 1) more stringent efficiency regulations; 2) increasing heat density in data centers as a result of the increasing data traffic; 3) increasing urbanization resulting in evolving food consumption trends and the need for refrigeration infrastructure; and 4) required infrastructure upgrades in more mature markets.
The Building HVAC Systems (“BHVAC”) segment (12% of PF LTM 12/31/18 revenue) manufactures a variety of OE and aftermarket heating, ventilation and air conditioning products for end-users in commercial buildings and data centers.
Demand for the BHVAC segment is driven by demand for building renovations, commercial construction, growth in data centers and higher efficiency requirements.  Consistent with industry forecasts for HVAC systems broadly, AOF estimates that approximately 2/3 of MOD’s BHVAC products are related to replacement products.
Investment Thesis
Management has successfully executed on its plan to streamline operations and diversify its revenue into higher growth end markets
Modine began its expansion beyond its legacy vehicular and BHVAC products in late 2015 with the announcement of its Strengthen, Diversify and Grow (“SDG”) strategy.  The plan focused on 1) cost reductions of $40-50mm within 18 months; 2) reducing customer concentration and cyclical exposure through increased investment in BHVAC, coils and other industrial products; and 3) acquisition of $100mm in incremental industrial revenue.  The Company also announced a $50mm buyback program.
Over the next 12 months, the Company reduced its SG&A spend to ~$170mm from levels that exceeded $240mm prior to the recession.[3]
In September 2016, the Company announced the acquisition of Luvata Heat Transfer Solutions (“Luvata”), the largest global manufacturer of coils, and a leading player in coolers and coatings for commercial and industrial applications.  Luvata was acquired for $422mm, representing ~7x LTM EBITDA of $59mm. At the time of the acquisition Luvata had $530mm of revenues. After the acquisition, MOD vehicular revenues as a percentage of the total decreased from 83% to 60%.  Since the acquisition, the Company has achieved cost synergies in excess of $19mm, exceeding the estimated $15mm of synergies announced at the time of the acquisition. Additional revenue synergies also materialized through expansion into markets where legacy Luvata did not have a presence, such as Brazil.
When Luvata was acquired it was growing revenues at 2-3%, which compares to YoY growth in the past four quarters of 7-10%[4], largely due to a mix shift towards data centers end-users.  Given the enhanced growth profile of the business and increase in multiples generally, we believe an 8x multiple is appropriately conservative to use in a SOTP valuation.
MOD Current and PF End Market Exposure (FQ3 ’19)
  The Company is conducting a sale of its auto business, which will result in improved growth and margins, while reducing cyclicality and materially lowering ongoing capital requirements
Ahead of the Company’s FQ3 ‘19 call, management announced the proposed divestiture of its auto business.  Proceeds are expected to be re-deployed towards share repurchases, debt paydown and re-invested in growth opportunities / acquisitions.
We believe the sale of the auto business should generate interest from strategic buyers particularly due to higher fuel efficiency standards and growth in electric car demand.  Baird estimates that MOD’s auto content on electric vehicles is $300 vs. $100 on an internal combustion engine vehicle today.[5]  In addition, the MOD auto business will benefit from the secular trend of additional electrical content per vehicle across all propulsion types of vehicles.
Baird has estimated that a sale of the auto business could be valued at $350-$400mm[6], which would represent an 8.4-9.6x EBITDA multiple based on our build of EBITDA of $41.5mm.  We have used a more conservative valuation of 5.0x or $207.5mm. Our conversations with management indicate minimal tax leakage from a sale of the auto business.  Based on the Company’s filings, we have analyzed the asset’s tax basis and believe the basis is approximately $284.6mm, which would result in zero leakage. We have also modeled 50bps to account for M&A fees.[7]
Management has also indicated that of the $75mm in LTM capex spend, $40mm is attributable to the auto business.  As a result, the divestiture would yield a substantial increase in go-forward free cash flow. While the Company’s current FCF yield is 12.4%, we believe that a FCF yield at ~8% pro forma the transaction is reasonable for an industrial asset, which would yield a share price of $24.33, ~60% above the current trading price.

  HVAC is an attractive industry and MOD’s BHVAC business is an attractive asset
HVAC Industry
The HVAC market is a $100bn+ market consisting of equipment and services products.  It exhibits GDP+ growth characteristics with moderate capital intensity. HVAC purchases are largely replacement purchases (roughly 2/3)[8], which are discretionary in the short-term, but necessary in the long-term.  As a result, the industry is inherently less reliant on new construction, though weather dislocations may create short-term volatility.
HVAC: A Long History of Secular Growth
The longer-term secular trend towards HVAC systems is driven by energy efficiency.  HVAC systems account for 30-50% of global commercial building energy use, which encourage the replacement rather than repair of HVAC systems as newer generations of systems yield improvements to energy efficiency.  JP Morgan estimates that the payback economics of HVAC replacements to be in the range of 3-4 years.
As a result, we believe that the payback economics for an HVAC unit provides some degree of insulation from broader cyclical pressures, particularly when compared to traditional industrial markets.
MOD’s BHVAC Segment (12% of PF MOD)
MOD’s BHVAC segment principally serves end-customers in data centers, commercial buildings and schools either as a direct supplier or through distributor.  The Company also provides branded supply for selected OEMs such as Carrier, as well as components and secondary products for niches where the large OEMs don’t have existing product.
Relative to the conglomerates in the space, we expect MOD’s LTM operating margins of 11% to remain structurally below peers, but anticipate continued margin expansion as the data center business grows.
HVAC Comparable Operating Margins
UTX, while discussing its proposed spin of the Carrier division, indicated that they believed the asset would trade for 12-12.5x on a standalone basis.[9]  Carrier reported full year 2018 sales of $18.9bn and 16% operating margins while reporting an increase in organic sales of 6%. Carrier expects HVAC revenues to increase in the mid-single-digit range this coming year, which is consistent with industry growth.
Lennox and Carrier, two of MOD’s larger OEM competitors, have both stated that they view industry consolidation positively and are actively seeking acquisitions within the HVAC market. Precedent HVAC transactions have ranged in the 8-15x LTM EBITDA range, which indicates that there is additional value to be unlocked for MOD’s HVAC business.
Nortek, a manufacturing asset with 2/3 of its business comprising of air solutions, was acquired by Melrose for 10x EBITDA in 2016.  Under its ownership EBITDA margins expanded >400bps, further supporting our thesis that MOD’s BHVAC asset should be financially compelling to a strategic acquirer.
HVAC Transaction Comps[10]
Given the incremental scale, growth and margin profile of peers above, we believe a valuation range of 8.5–9.5x is reasonable for MOD’s business, which based on an EBITDA of $27.2mm would yield a value of $230.9-$258.1mm.[11]
Trading comps also support this valuation range, with publicly traded conglomerates trading well in excess of ~10x, albeit with greater scale and higher margins.
BHVAC Trading Comps
  The remaining VTS segment post auto business divestiture (47% of PF MOD) will have incrementally superior return on capital characteristics
Following the sale of the auto business, VTS will retain its higher value-add business focused on the commercial vehicle and off-highway segments.
Products in this segment are primarily related to heavy-duty trucks and medium-duty trucks, school buses, transit buses, motor homes and motor coaches within the commercial vehicle end-market, and construction, agricultural and mining equipment and engine manufacturers.  Specific products for the commercial vehicle and off-highway end-markets include powertrain cooling (engine cooling modules, radiators, charge air coolers, condensers, oil coolers, fan shrouds and surge tanks), on-engine cooling (EGR coolers, engine oil coolers, fuel coolers, charge air coolers and intake coolers) and auxiliary cooling products (transmission and retarder oil coolers and power steering coolers), and battery thermal management systems.
Despite strong recent revenue growth trends, the Company’s VTS segment margins have been temporarily depressed due to raw material and trade-related cost pressures and operating inefficiencies at the Company’s plants.  The Company is working through alternative sourcing strategies and customer cost sharing arrangements to help mitigate the impact. Management estimated that tariff-related headwinds resulted in $10-13mm of adverse financial impact to fiscal 2019 earnings and has indicated to us that the headwinds are largely related to the non-auto VTS segment.
Valuation
Based on the SOTP multiples outlined below, we have arrived at a base case target price of $19.44, representing a ~30% premium to the Company’s current share price of $14.98 (as of 4/26/19).
We have also modeled a scenario in which the auto business reflects $10mm of additional EBITDA upside as a result of prospective strategic buyers being willing to compensate MOD for G&A savings.  The upside case value of ~$260mm remains substantially lower than Baird’s estimate of $350-$400mm for the auto business’ transaction value. The SOTP also makes no assumption that the management-estimated $10-$13mm tariff headwind abates.
MOD SOTP Valuation[12]
Risks
A failure to monetize the auto business
As multiples trade down in the auto sector, prevailing concerns around a slowdown in SAAR might lead to subdued interest in the asset.  A failure to monetize the asset or a divestiture below the asset’s intrinsic value may lead to lost value.
  Cyclicality, particularly in the commercial vehicle and off-highway segments
While divesting the auto business will substantially de-risk MOD’s cyclicality, the commercial vehicle and off-highway segments have in recent history experienced significant growth that may be indicative of the tail-end of a cycle.
  Tariff negotiation with China loses momentum
A lack of progress on trade negotiations with China would continue and perhaps even exacerbate margin pressure for MOD.
  Raw material pricing
MOD is exposed to raw material pricing in aluminum, nickel and steel.  While pass-through pricing is in place for some products, these are often with a 3-12 month lag, leaving the Company exposed to variations in commodity prices in the interim.
  Slowdown in data center business
The very strong recent growth to the data center end-market is likely unsustainable beyond the next few quarters.  While management has indicated to us that they expect margin stability even as growth slows, moderating data center growth may adversely impact operating income for MOD’s CIS segment.
  Substantial competition, particularly in HVAC products, with competition that includes well-capitalized, scale players
The HVAC market consists of large, well-capitalized players with substantial scale and superior margins.  MOD’s HVAC peers may seek to more aggressively displace MOD’s products with its end-users.

  Monetization of auto business
We expect the sale of the auto business to serve as the principal near-term catalyst.  Following the divestiture, the overhang around cyclical pressures should largely subside, which we expect to lead to a multiple re-rerating based on the SOTP values outlined above.
  Activist engagement pushes for a sale of the remaining business to strategic buyers
PF MOD will be comprised of a collection of stable industrial assets that we expect should attract strategic and financial interest.

Summary:  Subaru has a great automobile lineup and is a great brand trading at a discounted valuation because of near term supply chain issues.  There are two catalysts that could make the stock more expensive again.  Subaru has less downside than any other car manufacturer (and less downside than most other companies, as well).  
  Brand:
  If you know any Subaru owners you know they tend to be kind of crazy about their cars.  
  J.D. Powers reviewed automotive brands and Subaru was at the top (in 2019).  I would argue that not much has changed in the minds of consumers since then.
  source: https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2019/07/j-d-power-releases-brand-loyalty-study-for-2019-subaru-takes-top-honors/
  There are several reasons the brand is popular:
  Their AWD (All Wheel Drive) system is well respected.  The WRX was popular with “tuners” as far back as the 90’s.  Their Ascent is popular with families (3rd row seating).  The Outback and Crosstrek are popular with “campers.”  My next-door neighbor typically buys cool, off-road cars like Land Rovers and Jeeps.  He bought a new Subaru Crosstrek and is very happy.  He still feels like he is driving something rough & rugged. 
  Millennials like this brand, too, for ESG and philanthropy values.  https://www.torquenews.com/1084/why-millennials-are-flocking-new-crosstrek-and-impreza-models
  Subaru has had many popular cars, going back decades.  Remember the Brat?

Valuation:
  Subaru is in the doghouse because of the chip shortage.  I stopped by my local Subaru dealer and there were ZERO Crosstreks in inventory.  Customers are buying them sight unseen.  There is a waiting list.  It did appear that they had plenty of Outbacks.

Sellside:  According to Bloomberg, there are 15 analysts covering Subaru (6 buys, 7 holds and 2 sells).  The lowest ranking analyst, from JP Morgan, says “sell” with a 1900 yen price target.  He says they need to control their quality costs and present a roadmap to improve profitability.  He is worried about competition from U.S. light truck market.  The 2 top ranked analysts have “buys” on Subaru with price targets between 2400 and 2900. 
  Summary: Subaru is one of the best Japanese car brands and it is also on the cheap side.  



Catalyst 1 - Efficiency switch:
  Demand for fuel efficient vehicles should increase as the price of gasoline increases.  There is empirical evidence that shows an uptick in the purchase of fuel-efficient vehicles starts two years after significant increases in gas price.
(source: https://www.alliedacademies.org/articles/the-impact-of-gas-price-trends-on-vehicle-type-choice.pdf)
  All the pieces are in place for Subaru to benefit from this.

(b)  Subaru is at the top of the list when it comes to improving efficiency.
    Source: https://www.epa.gov/automotive-trends/highlights-automotive-trends-report#Highlight3



(c) As most of usl know, the price of gasoline made a significant move up in the last 6 months:
6 months ago gas averaged $2.20.  Now it is $3.10
  It is fun to take things to the extreme.  At $300/barrel oil, a gallon of gas will still cost only $8.34 (Source:  https://econbrowser.com/archives/2014/06/gasoline-price-calculator).  If you are driving around a Jeep that gets 15 mpg and gasoline hits $8.34/gallon, the total cost of ownership (lease + fuel) for a shiny new Crosstrek will be lower than just the variable cost of driving your Jeep.  You can just park the Jeep (assume no salvage value) and lease a Subaru like my hipster neighbor.  If you actually drive off road and think that only a Jeep will do, worry not, the Subaru can handle it.
  Comparison of Jeep Wrangler vs. Crosstrek:

  Summary of Catalyst #1:  Recent increases in fuel prices will lead to an uptick in the purchase of fuel efficient vehicles, of which Subaru is well positioned.


Catalyst # 2: Dividends.
  Subaru cut their dividend distribution at a time of “peak covid” fear in March of 2020.   From Investor Relations: “The Company positions the return to shareholders as an important managerial issue and have adopted performance linked approach based on continuous and stable dividend payouts, taking into account the business performance, investment plans, and business environment for each fiscal period.  The global pandemic of COVID-19 and the worldwide semiconductor shortage continue to exert a significant impact on the Company's production, sales, and other business activities. As a result of considering, from a comprehensive perspective, this unpredictable business environment, future fund demands, and other factors, the company's common stock will be 28 yen per share as per the latest dividend forecast.”
  Source: Subaru investor relations
  They cut their dividend in response to pandemic and chip shortage (yet it is still yielding 2.5% after cut).  If the dividend is restored to prior levels, the equity would yield 6.4%.  Even after the dividend cut, the dividend has increased 8% per year since the beginning of the century.
  Their cash is piling up. Cash per share is at an all time high.

Downside:
  Most of the time I don’t know why car companies (or any other companies for that matter) trade at 2x ebitda or 20x ebitda.  When the market is feeling good, they trade one way.  When the market is feeling bad they trade another.  I can’t recognize bottoms.  I can’t recognize tops.  However, I know myself.  I’ve been through a few bear markets.  I have found that when the numerator causes TEV/EBITDA to hit 0 (and there are no bondholders to worry about) I usually am a pretty good buyer.  So please excuse my temporary digression into the investment climate we find ourselves.  I will tie it back to the value proposition for owning Subaru shares.
  Equity inflows (whatever those are) are at a record high.  Where is this money coming from? What will happen when it stops?  Can it go on like this forever? 
 

The Fed is quantifiably unhinged.  The Taylor Rule quantifies the Fed’s mandate (price stability and full employment).  The Fed Rate is lower than it should be by a wider margin than anytime in history:
    For the first time in decades inflation is higher than the yield on the 10-year bond!
  I don’t like it when people put scary macro data in a stock pitch but I needed it to set the stage for Subaru’s value proposition.  In a bear market a company’s share price can get cut in half for no reason.  In a bear market I can see 50% haircut happening to any number of debt-laden car companies but if Subaru’s share price gets cut in half you will be sitting on a business with a zero enterprise value (Free!).  If Ford’s market cap gets cut in half the enterprise value will still be higher than it was 3 years ago. Did they sell more cars this year than they did 3 years ago?  No, they sold less.  Toyota?  If their share price gets cut in half, the enterprise value will still be higher than it was last year!!!  There is solid ground down there with Subaru. You cannot say that for most stocks. The way Subaru is positioned verse other car makers is truly unique. Hopefully, we don’t touch zero ev.  If we do it will probably feel right to buy more.

Investment Risks:
  Smallest car maker might be last in line to get the chips. 
  Consumer tastes change?  Love turns to hate.  
  Subaru’s plugin electric cars (based on Toyota’s tech) aren’t successful.   Note: Toyota owns 20% of Subaru.  Subaru’s Crosstrek uses Toyota’s plugin hybrid technology.  
  Revenue was flat over 5 years prior to covid19.

OCGN traded for $.30 in December, has raised around $.45/share, so should trade below $1 shortly.
  The trip $.30 to $19 and back to $9 is due to OCGN's agreement with Bharat Biotech, an Indian vaccine manufacturer, to import their Covaxin vaccine to the US market.  Uniformed retail traders seem to believe that this will be a profitable business for them.
  There are many layers of protection for this short.  Here they are, in order:
  1) The FDA will not approve the EUA for Covaxin
Based on recent guidance (which was much more negative for OCGN than prior guidance, https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-prevent-covid-19) and consistent with prior guidance, the FDA needs ALL of the following to be true in order to approve EUA for Covaxin:
    a) Trust the data.  The data for Covaxin is from an India-only study.  The PM of India approved Covaxin before the data were collected, so it would have been the end of his political career had the data read out badly.  Magically, the data is just good enough, with a 78% efficacy.  The FDA cannot simply accept this data as legitimate given those dynamics.
  b) Trust the manufacturing.  As the document shows, it is impossible to approve an EUA for a drug without the manufacturing also in place.  The FDA cannot approve Covaxin, the drug, and then say to OCGN, ""Go manufacture it however you like.""  The FDA must have samples from the manufacturing plant that will be used to make the drugs.  This plant is in India.  And it is currently illegal to export vaccines from India.  So, the FDA would have to approve a manufacturing site that could not be used to supply the US market.  This is obviously problematic.
  c) Determine there is justification for emergency authorization in the first place.  We are drowning in vaccines in the US right now, and exporting them to other countries.  The existing vaccines do a good job with all known variants of the disease.  There is simply no emergency here.
  FWIW, I have heard (secondhand) from former FDA employees that this submission has no chance of being approved.  Also, the company started submitting master file data to the FDA in March and hasn't heard anything back from them, evidently.  Not a good sign!
  2) If the FDA grants the EUA, then people have to use it.  Is there anyone left to take a vaccine?  Would you take this vaccine over Pfizer's?  Would anyone you know?  Will all the people who have refused to get a vaccine to this date somehow be convinced to take a vaccine made in India with a problematic history?
  3) If people want to take it, then Ocugen has to manufacture it in the US.  They will need to run a full trial in the US even after receiving EUA.  They will need to scale up manufacturing.  And, after all this, they will keep 45% of the EBIT.  Let's assume that everyone needs an annual booster (unlikely).  Flu vaccines are 180m/year at $10 each, roughly.  Let's say there are 250m Covid boosters/year at $20 each (super generous).  This is a $5B market, so even if Covaxin captures 20% (no way, given 78% efficacy) at 40% margins, they will take home around $130m of net income.  How long is this Bharat license for?  10 years?  Maybe this is worth $1B.  I can't imagine it's worth more than that.  This is under $5/share.  Discount that however you like...
  Let me also say that the company is sleazy, in a standard penny-stock way.  Lots of ATM offerings, bogus press releases (their last one had a blatant lie in it, e.g.), related party transactions (CEO's son especially, doing stuff like this Chester County spent $13 million on coronavirus antibody tests. Then it quietly shelved the program. (inquirer.com)).
  This should play out in the next few months, so the timing is relatively favorable here.
I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

Investment Thesis
  Black Hills Corporation (“BKH” or the “Company”) represents a stable and growing utility asset that holds a significant potential oil and gas asset in the Mancos shale.  Only a small portion of the Mancos Shale assets have been proved out.  BKH and other drillers are in the process of delineating the prospect.  Initial drilling results have been positive and have led to increased drilling activities.  Historically, BKH has successfully monetized other oil and gas assets, including the sale of itsWillistonBasinassets to QEP in 2012 for a premium price.  BKH is pursuing a similar deliberate strategy in the Mancos.  BKH’s current share price reflects only a small portion of the optionality associated with increased drilling in the Mancos with downside protection from the utility asset base.  Utility risk can be hedged out against the XLU.
Company Overview:
BKH has three business segments.  First its traditional utility business operates inColorado,Iowa,Kansas,Montana,Nebraska,South DakotaandWyoming.  Second, its non-regulated subsidiary produces and sells electricity and coal under long-term contracts to the utility and operates in a utility-like fashion.  Third, its oil and gas operations described in more detail below.

Mancos Shale Opportunity
            Drilling activity in the Mancos is picking up steam with Encana, WPX and BKH represent the largest acreage holders and drillers.  WPX drilled two wells in the target areas in 2013 with impressive reported results.  BKH and Encana drilled a number of wells, but have yet to report the results.  In 2014, WPX and BKH both elected to expand their drilling programs to drill another 12 and 6 wells, respectively.  Both companies are sharing drilling data to reduce overall development costs and WPX has stated that by end-2014 it should have delineated 80% of the field.  WPX has also indicated that should its drilling program continue to be successful it would double the company’s gas reserves from 18tcf to 36tcf.
WPX has only found gas in its wells to date.  WPX two wells to date have shown impressive IP rates:

  BKH has indicated that its current and prospective drilling activity is in areas where it believes NGLs are present.  Encana has alluded to NGL production in its current drilling activities, but has not yet released its drilling results.  The potential presence of NGLs is supported by BKH’s election to enter into an agreement with Summit Midstream (SMLP) for gas processing: “Red Rock is continuing to develop the 20 MMcf/d cryogenic DeBeque processing plant which will process liquids-rich Mancos shale production under a long-term, fee-based agreement with Black Hills Exploration & Production, Inc. The DeBeque plant is on schedule to commence operations by the end of 2013.” (SMLP Q3 ’13 Conference Call).  While BKH’s wells may be in areas where gas flow rates are lower than WPX’s results, they offer the opportunity for NGL upside. 
In the Mancos, BKH maintains a large, relatively, unproven position for which it gets little credit.  The Piceance produces liquids rich gas opportunity and theSan JuanBasinis dry gas.  In its investor presentation, BKH has laid out its potential reserves as follows:

              BKH’s description of its potential reserves under represents the potential opportunity, due to its failure to update its core operative assumptions.  First, it assumes well spacing of 160 acres; however, WPX and BKH have indicated that well spacing will likely be much tighter than this figure and closer to 80 acres, if not lower.  Second, it assumes EURs per well of 6bcf per well based on the results of prior 2011 test wells.  BKH’s production guidance for 2014 of 13.4 – 14.4Bcf points to higher EURS, which supports management comments at its recent analyst day where it pointed to EURs of between 8-9bcf per well.  The increase in prospective EURs is driven by the knowledge gained through its scientific drilling activities which has led it to increase frac stages from 5,000ft to 10,000 ft, consistent with the drilling strategies employed by WPX.  Third, BKH does not include 20,000 net acres it acquired in the Piceance in 2013 through a drill to earn arrangement.  BKH will complete the two wells required to earn these incremental 20,000 acres.  If one adjusts BKH’s potential reserve presentation, the results would be as follows:
          Net Acreage
  # Potential Wells
  Implied Acreage Spacing
    Average Royalty

  The opportunity in the Mancos is significant for BKH and would represent a 2nd step in its E&P monetization strategy.  On August 27th, BKH sold itsWillistonBasin oil and gas assets for $227mm vs. their PV-10 value of $56mm.  BKH has indicated that it will pursue a similar deliberate approach to proving out its Mancos assets prior to monetizing the asset in the most tax-advantaged manner possible.
  Risks:
  Gas Price Decline – Given the predominant gassy nature of the assets, declines in natural gas prices could have two effects.  First, BKH could elect to slow down its drilling program, which would extend the development timeline.  Second, declines  in gas prices would also have negative implications on value and the economic viability of the field.  The potential presence of NGLs provides a small offset.
  Limited Information – BKH is currently completing the drilling of two wells.  Both of these wells were situated on fields that it recently acquired in a drill to earn program.  These drilling programs are subject to strict confidentiality.  While it will be possible to see some of the results through changes in their financials in 2014, full details on the well results will only be known around mid-2014.
  Drilling Failures – Any failures in its drilling program would raise questions regarding the viability of the field.
  Acquisitions – BKH continues to have an appetite for acquisitions.  It has been involved in a number of utility auction processes (Missouri Gas and New Mexico Gas) of fairly significant scale (approx. $1bn).  Any such acquisition would like be funded at least in part with equity.

Catalyst
Catalysts:
  BKH Drilling Results: BKH has not yet released its drilling results from the two wells it drilled in 2013.  The release of these results will be delayed to around June 2014, due to confidentiality agreements with the seller.  The decision to significantly increase capital spending into the Mancos anecdotally points to positive results.   Investors will potentially be able to determine results before June by looking at the quarterly financial statements which should show a significant increase in gas production.  NGL production will be more difficult to determine given likely increases in NGLs from some of BKH’s other assets.  Data from partners, such as SMLP, could provide additional data points through the year.
WPX Drilling Results - WPX continues to drill in the Mancos shale and is stepping up its drilling program  It has no restrictions on its data releases and should be continue to release drilling results over the next year.
Asset Monetization – BKH has a demonstrated ability to monetize its asset base.  The Company has publicly stated that the asset base is too large for it develop on its own and it will seek to monetize the asset in a manner that retains the significant underlying option value.  BKH’s historically track record is constructive.",13.58797236074794,17.701740621232183,15.035148896958125,6.347034581120512,2.096579575257477,5.792292892561805,14.507281003197065,17.905307646937878

EGHT – Investment Thesis
June 2020
All figures presented in US$ millions, except for per share data.
All share price data as of 6/26/20.
Fiscal year ends 3/31.
  Short the $12.50 02/19/21 puts for $1.90 and receive an annualized return of 28% (based on 238 days until expiry) so long as the share price is greater than or equal to $12.50.  The stock is currently at $15.40 as of today (06/26/2020).  This trade provides 100% principal protection so long as share price declines less than 31%.
  Situation Overview:
8x8 (“EGHT” or the “Company”) is a leading cloud provider of enterprise communications services.  The Company offers a complete range of communications products – UCaaS (unified communications), CCaaS (contact center) and CPaaS (communications platform) – through a unified platform and single stack.
EGHT trades at a substantial discount to its principal comp, RingCentral (“RNG”), due to a persistent gap in growth rates and a lower margin profile.  Over the past three years, EGHT has implemented numerous business initiatives to re-accelerate growth, which are just now beginning to be realized.  We believe the Company is well positioned to accelerate growth which should result in a re-rating of the valuation.
Shorting the $12.50 02/19/21 puts presents a unique risk/reward scenario: if the share price remains flat or increases, the investor will realize a 28% annualized yield based on the option premium of $1.90 and an effective conversion price of $10.60.  If the share price declines below $12.50 and the investor is required to buy the underlying security, the effective purchase price per share is $10.60, or 31% lower than today’s trading price, which equates to a FYE March 2022 Revenue multiple of 1.9x vs. 2.9x today.  For reasons articulated below, we believe there is material upside to EGHT’s current valuation.
  Company and Industry Overview:
EGHT offers unified communications, contact center solutions, team collaboration, conferencing and analytics to business customers on a SaaS model through a single-stack, integrated platform. 
EGHT owns all of the core technologies that power its service offerings enabling highly integrated bundling and pricing flexibility.  In contrast, RingCentral (“RNG”), its primary competitor, relies on inContact for its contact center solution and Zoom for its video solution. 
Following a deceleration in revenue growth from 25% in FY 2016 to 17% in FY 2017, EGHT began a lengthy reorganization process that has focused on: 1) shifting from a direct sales model to a channel model similar to its primary competitor RNG,  2) product extension through acquisition and migration of all of its applications onto a single platform (X-Series), 3) a shift in focus away from less profitable small business customers (which are now auto provisioned through the e-commerce channel) towards mid-market and enterprise customers, and 4) the addition of the value-added reseller (“VAR”) channel within its channel model. 
These actions are beginning to bear fruit: revenue growth accelerated to 26% in FY 2020 and bookings growth has exceeded 25% for the past several quarters.  Investors remain keenly focused on the Company’s ability to sustain these elevated growth rates, as well as expand its margin profile, which is reflected in the sizable valuation gap between EGHT (2.9x NTM Revenue) and RNG (20.7x NTM Revenue, growing >30%). 
UCaaS: Unified Communications-as-a-Service – 70% of new bookings[1]
The vast majority of communication platforms in existence today are legacy, on-prem seats such as Avaya, Mitel and Shoretel, amongst others.
UCaaS offers a number of advantages over legacy systems:
1) Enables expanded mobile work forces with a single cloud based application across multiple connected devices for all communication needs which can be configured remotely and dynamically.  Combines voice, text, conferencing, web meetings, audio, voicemail onto a single interface for users that is not device or location dependent.
2) Eliminates up-front capex costs and enables IT departments to manage the entire system from any location because it is hosted in the cloud, thus reducing IT staffing and travel costs.
3) Solutions can be more easily integrated with other business applications, such as customer relationship management (CRM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) apps enabling more automated customer/supplier interactions.
The $50bn+ enterprise communications market remains less than 10% penetrated by UCaaS which has consistently grown at a 15% CAGR.[2]  According to Gartner, by 2021 90% of IT leaders (up from 50% in 2019) will likely choose a cloud UC offering over on-prem UC infrastructure.
Retention rates across the UCaaS industry are ~100% as nearly all installations replace legacy on-prem systems.
CCaaS: Contact Center-as-a-Service – 30% of new bookings
Contact centers are increasingly providing omni-channel customer engagement channels, which include VoIP, email, website interfaces and SMS. 
Much like UCaaS, CCaaS reduces the need for on premise capex and makes it easier for businesses to add additional lines and features without any incremental on-prem installations / equipment.
The $24bn market is estimated to be 15% penetrated[3] and growing at a 10% CAGR[4].
Our channel checks have indicated EGHT’s contact center solution is particularly appealing to mid-market customers (<500 seats).  It is estimated that 95% of the world’s contact centers have fewer than 150 seats.[5]
While standalone solutions, such as from Five9, Genesys and Talkdesk are more effective for large enterprises with the need for a sophisticated contact center solution, EGHT’s offering is ideal for mid-market customers who require a sophisticated UCaaS solution, but would also like a sufficiently capable and integrated CCaaS offering from a single company.
As shown below, Garner buckets 8x8 as a contact center challenger, at close range to the industry’s incumbent platforms.
While RNG offers a bundled solution with inContact, our channel checks have indicated that the solution is less seamless than EGHT’s offering and requires support be conducted through two different companies.  At the beginning of the sales process, RNG’s bundled offering requires a demonstration with an inContact sales rep and a separate bidding process. 
The customer ROI for a UCaaS solution is highly compelling, while the economics for a CCaaS solution are not nearly as attractive.  EGHT’s ability to offer bundled, cost-effective solutions uniquely positions the Company to offer the customer an attractive ROI on a consolidated basis.
  The value proposition for EGHT is straightforward for VARs to pitch: access to a leading UCaaS and CCaaS solution with a unified interface on a single platform with “one throat to choke.”  The combination is also attractive from a security and analytics perspective as EGHT has sole access to the data on its platform in an aggregated form.
In the most recent quarter, 71% of new bookings for customers with over 50 seats were for bundled UCaaS and CCaaS solutions, which compares to 52% a year ago, suggesting that the model is resonating with customers.  Contact center bookings grew 76% in the most recent quarter and now represent 30% of new bookings.
  Investment Thesis
1)   The Company’s pivot towards mid-market and enterprise customers is driving materially higher ARR growth and improved churn, yet represents just 45% of ARR today.
EGHT’s growth rate has been constrained by is historical focus on small business and its over-reliance on a direct sales force.  The small business segment is more penetrated and has lower lifetime value due to substantially higher churn compared to mid-market and enterprise customers.
The Company’s small business customer ARR growth of 16% is consistent with the broader market.  By comparison, ARR for enterprise and mid-market customers grew 79% and 55%, respectively, during the quarter ended March 31, 2020.
In the past year, the Company has retooled its sales strategy with a focus towards mid-market and enterprise customers.  In the past four quarters, the Company has grown its mid-market and enterprise mix from 36% to 45%, proving management’s ability to capture this segment of the market.
  EGHT’s overall net revenue retention rate is just below 100%, which is comprised of a consolidated mid-market and enterprise customer retention rate of 110% and a small business customer retention rate below 90%.  As with other SaaS businesses, EGHT’s economic model is highly sensitive to retention rates.  Even small reductions in churn equate to a significant uplift in a customer’s lifetime value.
The Company’s small business customers account for 2/3 of total churn.  70% of the small business customer churn is from customers using legacy handsets who are unable to generate value from the platform.   As this legacy customer cohort churns off, overall retention should improve significantly.
Customer lifetime value will also grow as EGHT shifts its sales focus to a larger customer.  The typical small business churn scenario involves either the customer going out of business or staying on its current platform, but receiving price concessions.  Mid-market / enterprise customers typically increase the number of seats and services consumed over time resulting in dollar retention greater than 100%.
2)   The recent roll-out of a VAR business model creates an interesting opportunity to take seats away from Avaya, Mitel, Shoretel and other legacy providers
EGHT has not historically utilized the VAR channel to generate sales.  The Company’s value proposition to VARs is particularly attractive as it allows them to create better economics for themselves by converting their existing legacy customers. 
Avaya, the company with the largest and most sought-after legacy customer base (~100mm endpoints), recently announced a partnership with RNG to offer RNG’s UCaaS platform to Avaya customers. 
While the Avaya / RNG partnership is certainly a competitive threat, we believe it is incrementally positive for EGHT as ~60% of the Avaya customer base has a relationship with the VAR, not Avaya.  Our channel checks have confirmed that the introduction of the RNG product to Avaya customers is catalyzing customers to explore a range of UCaaS options, of which 8x8 is a beneficiary.  Avaya has been the largest share donor to EGHT over the past few quarters.
The opportunity for EGHT arises from the economic model of the Avaya / RNG partnership.  In the Avaya / RNG model, RNG pays the VAR a small cash payment and 25% of revenues, as opposed to the existing model in which the VAR receives 50% of revenues.  
As such, VARs are highly incentivized to include 8x8 in customer upgrade discussions.  Avaya’s largest distributor, ScanSource, approached EGHT to offer the existing Avaya customer base a cloud product with economics which more closely resemble the traditional VAR / vendor relationship.  In January 2020, EGHT launched its VAR strategy with ScanSource, and it is expected to begin contributing more meaningfully to bookings in the second half of this year. 
More broadly, the channel strategy is paying off, as channel partner bookings grew 63% in the quarter ended March 31, 2020 and represented 54% of total bookings.  5 of the top 10 wins were Avaya replacements, demonstrating EGHT’s ability to capture this customer base.
3)   Management expects to expand gross margins by 1,000bps driven by the Company’s e-commerce platform, reduced support for smaller customers (where too much time is spent today) and CPaaS GM growth as international scales
EGHT’s gross margin of ~55% is materially below software peers and RNG’s 74% gross margin.  Management has attributed the margin differential to: 1) small business deals which remain highly resource intensive, 2) recent investments into the channel, and 3) its recent entrance into CPaaS which is lower margin at the moment[6].
In July 2019, the Company launched its e-commerce platform for the 1-9 seat “micro” segment of the market, which enables customers to buy, deploy and support products with zero human intervention.  This enables the sales force to focus on larger customers, while lessening the burden of unprofitable / resource-heavy small business customers.  Of the 5,500 new logos on-boarded in Q4, 2,000 were from the e-commerce offering.  We believe the e-commerce platform will be a key driver of future margin enhancement.
Management also cited outsized costs to support larger small business and lower mid-market customers.  To reduce costs related to deployment and administration, earlier this year the Company offshored several functions out of high cost locations (SF, NY, London) and eliminated numerous roles relating to non-revenue generating functions.
EGHT’s CPaaS margins remain a drag on the Company’s overall margin profile.  EGHT entered the CPass through an international acquisition.  As the overall international segment scales, Management expects CPaaS margins to improve.  Additionally, higher-margin services such as chat and voice are increasingly bundled with this offering.
4)   Management has guided towards profitability breakeven by year-end F2021 (3/31/21) with cash flow breakeven following in 2-3 quarters
While the recent sales and marketing initiatives required heavy investment, we believe the Company’s investments towards its go-to-market strategy, sales, marketing, lead generation and delivery and deployment were effective and are reflected in the number of multiple quarters of 25+% bookings growth. 
Recognizing that the Company’s ability to demonstrate the business model’s leverage with sustained growth and expanding margins will be a key driver of share price performance, management has now shifted its focus towards achieving profitability.  In addition to gross margin improvements, EGHT’s S&M efficiency (S&M / incremental revenue) considerably lags peers (~3x vs. 1.6x for peers)[7].  The metric has remained elevated for the past several quarters through the Company’s transition and remains a clear opportunity for improvement. 
5)   EGHT is a highly strategic asset
The Company has indicated they have received in-bound acquisition interest in the past, but deemed the enterprise opportunity was too close and too large to sell.[8]
EGHT’s product set would be a natural fit for any of the large strategic players (Microsoft, Google, Amazon) with existing enterprise collaboration software.  To date, Microsoft has had limited success against EGHT and RNG as their voice solution architecture is not yet competitive.  Google has not yet invested in enterprise class voice solutions.  Amazon has created interest for AWS with Amazon Connect and Amazon Chime, but has yet to enter the market in a more substantive way. 
Other potential acquirers may include a CRM platform such as Salesforce which may be a good fit given their base of enterprise customers; or Oracle given their sizable communications arm and existing relationship with EGHT.[9]
Ultimately, we believe it makes sense for EGHT to be integrated as part of a larger player’s enterprise platform.  Potential synergies would be meaningful given existing sales relationships, the cross-selling opportunity, and the deployment cost advantages from significant scale.
  Valuation
EGHT trades at a material discount to peers in both the communications segment and the broader software universe.  As discussed, a discount is warranted due to the slower growth profile and margin structure of EGHT. 
The comps below demonstrate that revenue growth is directly correlated with higher revenue multiples.  As such, we believe acceleration in EGHT’s revenue growth trajectory will result in a corresponding uplift in multiples.
At 18.4% forecasted growth for EGHT, consensus estimates for EGHT do not assume any acceleration in revenue growth.  The research community is essentially underwriting a scenario in which EGHT grows just modestly above market and substantially below EGHT’s recent growth in bookings.  We believe this bodes well from a risk/reward perspective, particularly for the trade’s proposed structure.
While difficult to forecast a precise future multiple, the illustrative valuation ranges below highlight that a 1.0x multiple uplift corresponds to a 32% increase in share price.
Risks
1)   EGHT competes in highly competitive markets
Across each of its three verticals (UCaaS, CCaaS and CPaaS), EGHT competes in highly competitive markets with well capitalized, scale players that have the capacity and willingness to sacrifice margin dollars to gain the customer relationship.
EGHT’s most direct competitor, RNG, enables customers to integrate competitive “best-of-breed” solutions across applications (Zoom, inContact).  As discussed, EGHT’s offering does not perform as well when customers require a complex contact center (500+ seats).  
While we believe EGHT’s bundled offering remains compelling for a significant portion of the market, a shift in customer preference away from an integrated offering towards a best-of-breed offering would be detrimental to EGHT.  For instance, if a prospective customer approaches their VAR and insists on retaining Zoom for video conferencing, the VAR may be inclined to push them towards the RNG platform which enables the Zoom integration.
RNG’s additional scale compared to EGHT (~2x the revenue) may enable it to out-invest EGHT in research and development and sales and marketing.
Larger players (MSFT/GOOG/AMZN) may also seek to enter the market more aggressively.  While our belief remains that the natural path forward is through an acquisition of EGHT / RNG, these players may instead choose to enter the market through an offering developed in-house.
2)   EGHT may face challenges scaling upmarket
While our proposed trade simply requires that the Company maintain its current financial profile, a continued shift towards a larger customer base is required to accelerate revenue growth rates from today’s level.  A slowdown in the mix shift may place a ceiling on revenue growth prospects, which would reduce the likelihood of a multiple re-rating.  Any increase in sales / deployment costs to service larger customers may also defer the year-end target for breakeven profitability.
3)   COVID may slow new enterprise deals; IT budgets may remain under pressure
In the medium-to-long term, the impact from Covid is expected to be a net positive for EGHT given the increased mobility of workforces driving the need for additional cloud-based solutions.   However, in the near-term the enterprise sales process will be more challenging as prospective customers remain focused on their day-to-day operations and wait for reduced uncertainty before exploring resource intensive projects.  In particular, management cited the retail, travel and hospitality sectors as having experienced pressure.

Description
Cornerstone Building Brands (CNR) is the largest manufacturer of exterior buildings products in North America.  CNR primarily produces windows and siding for homes, with approximately two-thirds of sales related to residential new construction or repair and remodel.  The remaining one-third of sales are primarily metal roofing, components, and panels for low-rise (buildings under 5 stories, such as offices and warehouses) commercial construction.  
CNR was created in 2018 after private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier, & Rice (CD&R) took Ply Gem private and later merged it with NCI Building Systems in the public market.  The resulting business was a market leading, highly levered, cyclical corporation, with significant exposure to the US economy.  
For more background, please see Motherlode’s pitch from last year.  Not only has the idea worked well since he pitched it – despite the pandemic - I believe the setup is significantly better now, and the name has passed what should be the biggest test it will encounter. 
2020
CNR entered 2020 with a 5.3x debt/EBITDA ratio, and ~40% of the business was exposed to commercial construction as an end market… if the company was going to go bankrupt, it was last year.  CNR was almost fully shut down for half of Q2, had to draw on its credit lines for a few months, and still has not seen a recovery in the commercial business.  Yet it is going to exit 2020 having done ~$240-260mm in FCF and net leverage is going to drop half a turn to 4.8x.  Now, as we enter 2021, the macro is reversing, results are going to reflect that, and I believe the stock will move much higher in the future.  
2021  
On the residential side – which has ballooned to nearly 2/3 of the business – new single-family permits and starts are hitting levels we haven’t seen since before the 2008 housing crisis.  
Multiple housing CEOs have talked about the rapidly improving outlook of the new housing market, and a few have compared conditions today to conditions during the last housing boom (read the KBH Q4 earnings transcript, for an example).  Months supply of existing housing is at all-time lows, home prices are rising at high-rates, and the Biden administration has stated that housing is a priority – the only release valve available is new housing.  
As this relates to CNR, ~1/3 of their business is exposed to residential new construction, and this shows up in the numbers >90 days after housing starts begin – windows, doors, and siding come later in the home construction process, well after framing begins.  
The window and siding industries are relatively stagnant, without massive changes in market share, and CNR has the highest market share in both vinyl windows and siding – nothing in our research suggests that this will change.  Thus, in the near future – specifically around end of Q1/start of Q2 - we expect to see the abnormally high single-family start stats flow through into sustained organic growth in the residential side of CNR’s business.  And on the 2020 Q3 call, management mentioned that the windows business would already be up 6% YoY, absent a ransomware attack that stopped supply for a few days. 
CNR also has ~1/3 exposure to residential repair and remodel.  This is a much more consistent business than home construction, as home repairs are continual and never declined more than low double digits (on a YoY TTM basis) even during the housing crisis.   R&R is more dependent on the age of housing stock and the consumer’s willingness to spend.  
However, due to the pandemic of 2020, there is a new wrinkle.  Last year, many people began working from home, and this is a trend that seems to have legs well beyond 2020.  For many, the house has now become a home/office hybrid, and at the minimum the value the average person places on their home has increased significantly, due to work, entertainment, and living in general.  Couple that newfound sense of importance with a rapidly recovering economy and likely high disposable income due to increasing gov’t stimulus, and the conditions are ripe for home R&R to sustain its upward trend for many years.  
Anecdotally, R&R backlogs and lead times for contractors/handymen in many regions of the country are still unusually high, lending credence to the belief that residential R&R should be a big tailwind for CNR. This part of the business will likely grow low to mid- single digits organically next year.  
    The commercial side – now around 1/3 of the business – is the great unknown but results were so skewed due to the Q2 shutdown that it will be difficult for the numbers to be down materially in 2021 unless the economy falls off a cliff.  In Q2 of last year, both sales and EBITDA fell around 23%, and both metrics are likely going to be down around 10%+ in Q4.  
The company has stated that the commercial business has “stabilized” over the past 2 quarters, so if we apply that to next year’s numbers and drop Q1 sales and EBITDA 13%, and drop Q2 sales and EBITDA 13% versus a baseline (ie. assuming no shutdown), it results in 2021 sales and EBITDA flat for the full year (assuming constant margins).  Thus it’s entirely possible that even if commercial construction spending declines 4-5% next year, CNR commercial business will outperform, if not grow.  
There are also a couple of other reasons to be less negative on the commercial business than the market suggests.  First, 25% of the commercial business pertains to warehouses heavily exposed to cold storage and data centers, two areas that have done quite well and should continue to perform better than the broader market as trends persist in their direction.  
Second, on the whole, the commercial division is very macro-sensitive, as we saw last year.  But given consensus calls for 4%+ real rebounds in GDP, and outliers like Goldman calling for 6%+ real growth in GDP, the risk on commercial seems to be to the upside – especially when one factors in an increasing pace of vaccinations and what should be the gradual fade of COVID as 2021 progresses.  Areas such as offices could begin to bounce back later this year as vaccination efforts ramp. 
Lastly, the commercial biz typically lags the housing upturn by 1.5-2.5 years, so it’s entirely possible that by the end of the year the sentiment on commercial will flip as revenue changes direction and indicators start pointing up.  A big Biden infrastructure bill would likely go a long way towards turning the tide on the commercial business, although it’s unclear if it’s even needed for the commercial segment to begin working again. 
Mgmt/cost cuts
Beyond the macro, management and CD&R’s involvement should supercharge EBITDA growth.  Nate Sleeper – CD&R’s CEO – is on the board and has a tremendous track record investing in industrials and is one of the more creative dealmakers around, and between him and Jonathan Zrebiec the CD&R team is going to relentlessly push for cost cuts.  It is absolutely not a coincidence that Jeff Lee – the CNR CFO – was brought in from another CD&R investment to clean up the cost structure - costs are going down.  We expect around $40-60mm in cost cuts in 2021 vs 2020, resulting in margin expansion as the compounding 2020 cost cuts flow through into the 2021 numbers and the company cuts costs further this year.  
Interest expenses are going to decline as well – in the second quarter the company will likely redeem their 2026 8% bonds at a premium to par.  The 2029 6.25% bonds now trade at a YTW of 5.0%, so assuming they could issue bonds at this rate, the company will cut ~$20mm in yearly interest expenses on this debt swap alone.  In addition to this, ~40% of the term loan facility is (effectively) floating.  Thus the company will likely see a benefit from a LIBOR rate that averages below 2020’s level.  
Value/Torque
Putting this all together, the stock is absurdly cheap.  Net debt likely falls to ~$2.9b by year end and with a current market cap of $1.5b, the EV is $4.4b versus 2020E EBITDA of ~$600mm, or 7.3x.  
Mid to high single digit sales growth for the entire company (flattish commercial biz and resi biz +HSD to +low DD) pushes EBITDA from $600mm to $640-650mm.  
Cost cuts will bump EBITDA to $680-700mm.  
FCF will come out somewhere between $250-300mm as interest expenses fall and working cap continues to contribute to the FCF build – working capital contribution to FCF could potentially double in 2021.  
So by the end of 2021 debt falls to $2.6-2.7b, dropping net leverage from 4.8x at the close of 2020 to ~3.8x by the close of 2021.  This causes EV/EBITDA to drop from 7.3x at the close of 2020 to 6.0x.  Meanwhile, the FCF yield will remain unusually high around 16-20%.  
Looking forward, if the EV/EBITDA level moves just slightly to 7.5x trailing, then the stock prices moves from $11.85 to $20 by year end.  
But there is reason to believe that 7.5x is the wrong multiple – that level is relatively low versus peers such as BECN (>10x trailing), DOOR/JELD (>8.5x trailing), FBM (bought out ~8.5x), and others, and it suggests that the FCF yield should stay elevated perpetually.  
As the commercial business starts to see daylight near the end of 2021, as the macro environment becomes much more favorable to a cyclical business, and as cash continues to pile up and the leverage ratio declines, I think it will be much more likely that CNR sees the EV/EBITDA ratio rise.  And due to the torque owing to a large debt balance, this results in a huge price increase from current levels, with the stock trading up to $22.60 @ 8x, and $28.10 @ 9x.  
I think a realistic price target for CNR, by year end 2021, is $20-25, equating to 7.5-8.5x EBITDA.

As of February 12, 2013:
Share Price: $44.22
Upside Target: $70+
Downside Risk: $40
Average Daily Trading Volume: 1.25MM shares or $55MM
  Basic Thesis
At under 10x 2013 FCF, TAP is an undervalued stock with significant upside leverage (via multiple expansion) to a rebound in US and Canadian “premium” beer volumes 
US “premium” beer volume has languished due to
Craft beer taking share of the beer category
A shift towards wine and spirits in the overall alcohol category
However, both of these trends should reverse over the next few year as:
The “Echo Baby Boom” will turn 21 and 20-30 year olds are target, higher volume consumers of premium beer compared to craft beer and wine and spirits
Unemployment has fallen hardest on blue collar males between 20-40, premium beer’s target market, and any rebound in employment should benefit premium beer
TAP is the most exposed brewer to US beer volumes
The US is ~45% of TAP’s EBIT and Canada is ~35%
Importantly, at 10x FCF vs. peers at 13-16x FCF, TAP equity is not currently discounting any improvement in US beer volumes
Thus TAP equity is an undervalued call option on a recovery in US employment
TAP has limited downside
Low multiple, low volatility “recession proof” business, and strong technical support at the $38-$40 level, which I view as realistic downside
I conservatively calculate upside at 13x a modestly bullish 2014 FCF estimate of $5.25, or ~$70 per share, vs. Street at ~$4.75
Essentially I believe as more growth comes US premium beer volumes, due to demographics and an improvement in employment, the earnings will go up modestly and the multiple will expand given expectations for stronger growth
I view TAP as a 1:5 risk-to-reward scenario
In particular, I view the downside as more probable (excluding market volatility in the event of a large plunge in the SPX) given TAP’s very stable business and very strong support at $38-$40
Bear Case
Big bear case/why it is so cheap
Bear Take: TAP is a lower quality, low growth portfolio of brands  that is underindexed to the growing area of beer (craft beers, beer-alternatives) at the same time that overall beer consumption is under pressure from a mix shift towards wine and spirits
My Take: While under indexed to the current beer demand environment, TAP is actually overindexed to those who are un/underemployed and would increase their beer consumption if employment conditions improve AND is exposed to a key demographic shift
TAP’s key brands (Miller, Coors) target demographic (20-40 year old men, particularly “blue collar” men) that has been hit hardest by the collapse of US residential construction AND is probable to see a significant improvement from a rebound in construction as well as continued growth in energy (shale gas/oil) and manufacturing (benefiting from lower domestic energy cost)
For instance, beer sales to North Dakota, where unemployment is low and fueled by energy, were up 18% in 2012 vs. ~2% for the entire US
Further, as the “echo baby boom” the share gain of wine and spirits, which is largely upon demographics as older drinks prefer wine/spirits to beer, should reverse over the next decade and favor beer again
TAP use of cash
Bear Take: Management are poor allocators of capital, choosing to buy Starbev in April 2012 at 11x EBITDA instead of increasing dividend/buying back TAP shares which were trading 8x EBITDA
My Take: While the Starbev acquisition was done at a higher multiple than TAP’s stock, that does not make the deal illogical and I do not believe management is “empire building” at the expense of shareholders.
The deal was done at a reasonable multiple for a beer transaction (even with the caveat that PE could have been running the business at peak margins)
TAP is undersized relative to conglomerates such as a ABI or SABMiller, which leaves TAP with fewer potential transactions to grow their business, hence this was the first transaction >$50MM in ten years
Starbev is exposed to the growing Eastern European markets and TAP should be capable of achieving synergies as well as using the platform to cross market brands such as Carling
While the market would likely have rewarded TAP more for increasing the dividend/buyback in this yield starved world, Starbev makes sense for the longer term and, given the scarcity of viable deals which can move the needle for TAP, I do not penalize management for their decision
Weak portfolio
Bear Take: TAP has a weak portfolio of brands, with Miller’s decline over the past three years offsetting Coor’s improvement. TAP has little exposure to craft beer.
My Take: TAP’s brands relative size and the complexity of alcohol distribution in the US and Canada leave TAP with a strong moat.
TAP brands might not be hot, new, and exciting, but they have stood the test of time are likely to grow at least modestly in the future
TAP’s JV MillerCoors is 33% of US beer sales (admittedly TAP only owns 42% of this JV) and 40% of Canada. Excluding market leader ABI, the next largest US competitor, Crown Imports (STZ), is under 5%.
Beer and alcohol sales in the US and Canada are governed by complex regulations that make entry and distribution difficult
TAP’s brands have strong pricing power

      We believe PowerFleet (PWFL) is a compelling long investment, with greater than 200% upside over the next several years.  The company, a product of a 2019 merger between I.D. Systems and Pointer Telocation, is a leading provider of IoT software and solutions to the industrial, logistics, and commercial vehicle industries.  PWFL’s offerings include hardware that captures data (e.g., location, speed, weight/load, temperature) and, more importantly, software that analyzes and interprets that data enabling customers to increase efficiency, improve safety and security, and reduce costs.
    Key attributes of PWFL include:
Ø  60% of its revenue base is recurring high-margin software.  Contracts are typically 48 months or more in length.
Ø  Strong secular tailwinds should drive 15%+ annual end-market growth for years to come.
Ø  “Who’s Who” customer list – e.g., Walmart, UPS, Walgreens, Proctor & Gamble, and Amazon.
Ø  Geographic reach and broad product portfolio to win large global tenders.  Management estimates PWLF’s win rate is 65% when head-to-head on a blended basis across end markets.
Ø  “Switzerland” of fleet management as their offering is manufacturer agnostic as opposed to OEM-tied competitors.  Thus, in mixed fleet environments, PWFL’s competitive advantage grows.
Ø  High-quality management team.  We have had multiple interactions with PWFL’s senior management and have come away impressed each time.  The CEO, Chris Wolfe, is an industry veteran with 20+ years of experience.
Ø  Strong sponsor with industry experience in Abry Partners.  Abry invested $50mm in a convert with a strike of $7.319 (>30% above the $5.54 recent close) at the time of the I.D. Systems/Pointer merger.  Having Abry representatives on the Board will ensure the company remains laser-focused on growing shareholder value.
Ø  Low capex needs and low tax rate create a compelling free cash flow machine, particularly as the business grows and leverages its fixed cost structure.  We project annual capex needs of just low single-digit millions.
Ø  Powerful margin expansion going forward.  The combination of (a) an increasing proportion of revenue derived from high-margin software sales, (b) operating leverage on fixed costs, and (c) cost synergies flowing from the merger should enable EBITDA margin growth from the low double-digits percent to the mid-20s percent.  Management’s target model achieves a 25% EBITDA margin at $200mm of revenues.
    Projections and Price Target:
Ø  Post the 2020 Covid speed bump, we model revenues to grow at a low-to-mid double-digit percentage rate for the next several years.
Ø  At the same time, we expect the EBITDA margin to expand 300-500bps per year.
Ø  The net result is we project roughly $50mm of EBITDA in 2024.  Note – management has previously targeted $50mm of EBITDA in 2023, but we think Covid likely results in a push to the right for that goal.
Ø  The FCF yield at that point based on the current stock price would be approaching 20%.
Ø  For a business with PWFL’s key characteristics – substantial recurring revenue + secular end-market growth + low capital needs – we think a 10x EBITDA multiple is conservative; something like 12x may be more likely.
Ø  10x yields a $17 target in three years; 12x produces more than a $20 share price.  These targets yield 200-270% upside to the current price.
Ø  We also note that M&A in the space has often transpired at mid-teens multiples.  No doubt, Abry will consider a strategic exit option when the time is right.

  Evercore – Long Thesis
  Introduction
  Financials look cheap. Their stock prices have been weak for obvious reasons – interest rates and term spreads have collapsed, credit risk and loan loss provisions are up, while trading & transactions in commercial and investment banking have plummeted.  And while the financial system is in better shape -- with stronger bank balance sheets and less exposure given a drop in riskier lending since the 2008 financial crisis -- persistent economic weakness could lead to larger than expected loan losses that could limit their profitability in upcoming quarters.  The Fed’s recent decision to cap dividends and buybacks after its latest stress tests highlight the risks associated with a prolonged downturn and its possible effects on capital buffers under dire Covid scenarios where the labor market remains weak.
  Despite the risks and macro uncertainty, I think long term the sector is undervalued and offers compelling risk-reward.  Names like JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Well Fargo – businesses with irreplaceable franchises, relatively strong capital positions and diversified revenue sources – will handily absorb losses and weather this downturn and likely preserve and strengthen their long-term earnings power.  As dislocations have largely dissipated, the recent strength in capital markets provides them with an unusual opportunity manage exposure to risk assets across consumer loans, mortgages, corporate debt CLO’s and commercial real estate.  The scrutiny of regulators on capital plans adds a layer of risk management that long-term oriented shareholders should ultimately welcome.  Considering the unprecedented (seemingly unlimited) liquidity and backstop of the economy by the policymakers – propping up the various debtors and counterparties that underpin bank loans – the more likely scenario is the government will absorb a material portion of the economic losses.
  I also don’t see existential threats from upstarts as credible.  Innovation and fintech are a source of opportunity, not a threat, and as these banks grow their tech budgets and adopt digital era tools for the benefit of their clients and customers.  The form and mode of delivery might change, but banks will continue generating predictable fee streams from everyday economic transactions.  From an investment standpoint what’s not to like? -- dominant scale, cost advantages (cheap deposit bases, operating efficiencies and economies, low customer acquisition costs) and switching costs provide them with significant competitive moats.  Bottom line, these are solid long-term core holdings and I believe now is as good a time as any to establish or add to a position. I have been adding. 
  First quarter results were painful with a massive rise in loan loss provisions -- but with the boost in unemployment benefits from the CARES Act, mortgage forbearances and the numerous government lending programs supporting businesses, it is possible that provisions in the second quarter will be lower than expected and the overall outlook will improve and look increasingly more benign from a credit exposure standpoint.  Irrespective of the short-term effects of this recession, and the temporary restrictions on capital distributions, banking stocks over time should continue to generate decently high ROEs in the mid-teens and return capital to shareholders in the form of healthy dividends and buybacks. 
  If the leverage, complexity and the credit exposure of the mega-banks make you nervous, there are other areas within financials that have been unfairly punished due to cyclical weakness.
  One area within Investment Banking that I particularly like is advisory.  It doesn’t require capital, is relationship driven and fee based.  In the last 10 years, mega-banks have diversified away from their core IB businesses and in the process have lost some of their appeal and cachet in the eyes of clients as their size has inhibited their ability to market themselves as “specialized” and “focused”. Banks like JPMorgan clearly possess a full spectrum of capabilities, but in M&A transactions CEO’s and boards increasingly look for specialization, and there is a benefit to being perceived as independent vs. integrated; not to mention an accelerating trend of clients seeking firms that are free of potential conflicts of interest that are inherent in bulge-bracket firms.
  I present to you Evercore (EVR) – the leading independent boutique investment bank that derives most of its revenue from M&A advisory and, to a lesser extent, a strong restructuring practice.
  High quality business
  Evercore (EVR) is a global investment bank with 1,900 employees across 28 offices in 12 countries.  The firm has three businesses – Institutional Equities (Sales & trading / research), Investment Management (Wealth mgmt. and Trust Services) and Global Advisory (Strategic / Restructuring and Capital Mkts advice).
  EVR’s core business and crown jewel is the advisory practice, where over the years it has built a remarkably strong brand having consistently gained market share for the last 10 years making it now the #4 advisor behind Goldman, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley.  Since its founding in 1995 it has advised on over $2 Trillion of announced M&A deals and now owns ~8.6% of the deal market (up from 2.3% in 2010). 
  Evercore's president and CEO Ralph Schlosstein, strengthened the advisory business after the GFC by aggressively hiring senior talent while larger BB firms retrenched and diversified under the scrutiny of regulators.  Between 2017 and 2019 headcount grew by 300, or nearly 20%.  In the long run, investing in top talent, has led to industry leading productivity per senior MD at ~$15 MM per annum – stellar numbers which have led to banner years in terms of growth and profitability. 
Hiring late in the cycle, however, hasn’t come cheap as average pay last year hit $622k and compensation rose to absorb 58.2% of revenue, up from 56.7% in 2018.  In January, management acknowledged the need to rightsize in order to preserve profitability and productivity.  However, as with most human capital business models, there is a lag from the time you “onboard” expensive talent to the time they become profitable “producers” – so while the year started with some fine-tuning layoffs, management has conviction a large proportion of recent SMD new hires (~30 out of 112) have yet to meaningfully produce and thus are investments that will ultimately payoff in future years.  Obviously Covid has impacted the trajectory of the new talent ramp, but as explained in the thesis section below, dealmaking will snap back and these assets will eventually generate a return in the medium / long run.
  In 2014 EVR acquired ISI Group – now Evercore ISI – which has given the Institutional Equities platform the scale and scope in research and distribution to offer a broad menu of services to its 1300 institutional investor clients.  Led by renowned economist Ed Hyman, the ISI group has won accolades and awards, placing its analysts and research among the highest rated in the street: https://rb.gy/jryul3.  Importantly, while the revenue contribution of Institutional Equities is still miniscule -- and the trading business is intensely competitive -- the platform’s solid reputation, growing coverage and distribution capabilities, create natural synergies with its underwriting and advisory businesses.  This has led to recent wins for Evercore being selected as lead bookrunner in notable transactions.  The strength in research and capital markets, as a capability, are key in continuing to attract top talent – which reinforces the network effect on the relationship side of the business that seek end to end solutions around advisory and execution.
  Finally, the Investment Management group, Evercore Wealth, is a 12-year-old business that provides discretionary and non-discretionary investment advisory, financial planning and investment consulting services to high-net-worth individuals and associated trusts, estates, pension plans, endowments, foundations, etc… It is ranked by Barron’s as one of the top independent RIA’s -- https://rb.gy/mu1yjx, has ~600 clients and >50 advisors.  As of December 31, 2019, Evercore Wealth managed a total of approximately $9.1 billion with a 10 year CAGR of 14%.  The most recent ADV outlines various aspects of the business, its fee structure and the various services it provides: https://www.evercorewealthandtrust.com/adv-brochure/. Their quarterly journal, Independent Thinking, targeting HNW, FO’s and Institutional clients, provides color on the group’s philosophy and new CEO, Chris Zander, target market and the : https://rb.gy/l7x3zz.
  Overall, EVR’s long term growth and fundamentals have been stellar:
  ·       20% CAGR in Revenue since 2010
·       24% CAGR in EPS since 2010 (from ~$0.96 to $7.70 in 2019 – peak $9.01 in 2018)
·       Over $2 billion in Net Revenue for 2018 and 2019
·       Operating Margin expansion from mid-teens to mid-twenties, hitting $450 to $550 MM in the last 3 years
  EVR’s execution in the last decade has been near flawless.  The main driver behind its profitable growth has been its aggressive recruitment of top talent – leading to a 40% increase in SMD headcount since 2015 (from 79 to 112)
  “We are a human capital business and our revenue and profits are tied to the number, quality and performance of our people. Our ability to pay appropriate levels of compensation in the form of equity incentives has enabled us to recruit, retain and motivate high-caliber talent dedicated to our long-term growth and success. We effectively use our equity compensation program as a form of capital expenditure to invest in, retain and grow the business through our people.”
  EVR’s equity-based comp has been a mix of RSU’s and other equity awards with long vesting schedules that are tied to individual and company performance.  Employees own over 25% of the company on a fully diluted basis; however, SBC expenses and the resulting dilution is managed and offset through yearly share repurchases.
  From a capital allocation standpoint, plowing back cash to fund new hire equity awards has generated terrific long term returns on a consolidated basis.
  Featured Transactions
  In 2019 EVR advised on some of the most prominent M&A, spin-off, restructuring and activist defense campaigns of the year.  Evercore advised on 7 of the 10 largest global M&A transactions and 5 of the 5 largest U.S. transactions.  Also during 2019, the divestitures group worked as an independent advisor on the two largest spinoffs of all time and the restructuring group worked on 8 of the 10 biggest bankruptcies by liabilities highlighting some of the debtor and creditor capabilities to serve clients in and out of court. The activism group advised on $1 trillion in market value in activism-related defense.
  Some notable examples include:
 ·       Activism Defense of Bristol-Myers Squibb against Starboard Value on its $93 billion acquisition of Celgene.
·       United Technologies $55 billion merger with Raytheon and spinoffs of Carrier and Otis
  Some of the restructuring situations that highlight EVR’s capabilities and are particularly relevant in originating business in 2020 are:
 ·       Challenging stakeholder negotiations
·       Obtaining covenant waivers and amendments
·       Structuring and executing liability management transactions such as exchange or tender offers and consent solicitations
·       Raising new debt and equity capital for complex and/or highly leveraged situations
·       Designing and implementing financing-driven recapitalizations
·       Buying or selling non-core assets or entire companies in a distressed context
·       Developing, negotiating and executing prepackaged or pre-arranged chapter 11 restructurings
·       Traditional chapter 11 restructurings
·       Cross-border and international recapitalizations
·       Providing expert valuation and testimony services
   Investment Thesis
 2020 is going to turn out to be a pretty awful year for M&A volume as the market environment is expected to remain challenged.
    EVR won’t be spared.  As mentioned earlier, even before Covid hit, EVR’s 1Q results were impacted by higher compensation and “business realignment costs” – with the stated goal to decrease headcount by 6% or ~115 individuals.  Pre-Covid cuts were focused on people that weren’t performing up to expectations, with the intention to reinvest into growth areas.   Earlier in the year, Schlosstein pointed to large white / grey spaces where SMDs would shine – e.g. in Europe in the software industry and advising financial sponsors.
  Nevertheless, Covid is here and Deals #’s will continue to be bad.  Some sectors with end markets disproportionately affected by Covid have seen significant late stage deals being pulled — e.g. Boeing walking away from acquiring Embraer’s jet business, and Simon Properties Group terminating the Taubman Centers acquisition despite strong deal protective clauses.  Merger arb hedge funds have increasingly been shorting targets, betting deals get delayed, renegotiated at lower prices, or fall through.
  According to Northstar Risk Corp, a software provider to arb traders, the combined implied probability of deals not closing spiked to 33% in March, up from 4% in January (based on spreads of 300 current deals they track).  That is down to 20% as of the beginning of June but still incredibly high by historical standards -- in the last 5 years around 98% of announced deals have closed.  So clearly Mr. Market remains quite skeptical about previously announced deals closing in the near term.
  But what about new deals?  The M&A Leadership Council recently completed a survey of 50 C-level executives and corporate development leaders about their plans.  Here is a HBR article that outlines the survey and the findings: https://hbr.org/2020/06/what-ma-looks-like-during-the-pandemic.
  While a critical mass of respondents clearly state they plan to halt or implement a “temporary pause” on current deal activity and will remain so until there is more clarity around an economic recovery, data reveals “an important and encouraging counterintuitive growth strategy for those executives and companies prepared to turn crisis into opportunity. We noted a significant percentage (23% of respondents) reporting either “no impact in 2020 forecast deal volume” or their intent to “accelerate” deal volume during the remainder of 2020 based on the increased number of opportunistic targets or more palatable valuations brought about by the crisis. Further analysis of these respondents provided vital insights for other executives and deal-makers intent on growing their companies during and after Covid-19.”
  And while some companies in position of strength look to take advantage of bad markets to take out vulnerable targets at cheaper valuations, others will be motivated by strategic imperatives to pursue deals that offer promising growth technologies.  For example, transactions that help accelerate digital transformations are arguably top of mind across verticals.  Other deal type objectives, besides distress and growth targets, include non-core divestitures to shore up balance sheets, and cost takeout consolidation deals.
  EVR has outlined its priorities in response to market volatility and Covid, noting the difficult market environment has led to a significant decline in announced M&A volumes, numerous downgrades and expected defaults and a decline in leveraged finance and equity issuance.  Clients are expected to be less M&A focused and more restructuring, balance sheet management and capital raising focused. 
  Their needs will evolve as they transition from disruption, to stabilization and recovery and EVR has outlined the repositioning of its internal capabilities to serve these needs in their advisory business creating fee generating opportunities until a more normalized environment returns in strategic M&A.
    Things I like about Evercore during this crisis:
  ·       Brand built on reputation as “most experienced” and “credible” dealmakers. Extensive M&A coverage network, considered a destination for talent.
·       Pristine balance sheet, plenty of liquidity ($846 MM of Cash & Liquid Investments) and flexibility in cash comp cost structure – limiting risk if M&A volume stalls for longer than expected
·       No lending risk or complexity relative to the large integrated mega-banks and broker dealers
·       Dealmaking volume has a floor in bad economic environments
o   Financial sponsors have plenty of dry powder and will act opportunistically
o   Consolidation makes sense in oversupplied markets
o   Strategic acquirers will pounce on weaker targets to strengthen their competitive market position
·       Distress cycle is a boon to restructuring practice, which despite the smaller scale of the business should somewhat counteract temporary weakness in M&A
·       Long term growth opportunities in sector and geographic coverage: TMT, Consumer, Financial Sponsors, Large Cap Multinationals in Europe.  TAM analysis highlights a pool of 10,000 sizeable companies SMD’s have screened as possible target clients
In the end, determining whether EVR can pivot and offset short-term cyclical weakness is less important than understanding the underpinnings of why this is unique firm with a franchise brand that has a reputational and talent stronghold over a significant piece of the dealmaking market.
  Global M&A deals announced in 2019 and 2018 were $3.8 and $3.9 trillion, respectively.  YTD during the first 6 months of 2020 global $ volume is down 50% at around $1 trillion, with sharper drops in within the America’s region.  In 2008/09 top line revenue for EVR dropped 40% and it had a compensation ratio of 75% that year.  Assuming non-compensation expenses are fixed, a drop of that magnitude in 2020 would imply a ~$100 MM operating loss or ~($2.10) / share.
  However, for long term investors, the only thing that really matters is the healthy balance sheet with ample liquidity and the fact that EVR’s earnings power, built over the last decade, will be preserved and resume once M&A activity snaps back to normal levels.  I expect the 2H of 2020 and 2021 to start showing some signs of life and healing as CEO’s start to seek strategic deal advice to adapt to this new market.  I expect normalized EPS of $7 to $9 in the next 2 years and believe further market share gains could warrant a mid-teens multiple in that time frame – translating into a $120 stock price.

Aercap is a high quality specialty finance company that has grown its book value at an average rate of 17% a year over the last 10 years, without a down year.  The company focuses on leasing commercial jets to airlines and its book value and earnings potential is based on an evolving portfolio of around 1,500 planes. The average age of a plane in the portfolio as of today is 7 years and the average remaining lease term is around 6.6 years.  The company has repeatedly had its assets appraised by outside advisors at a premium of around 5%-10% to the stated book and that metric has been verified annually as they sell assets and recognize an average gain on sale of around 7% (showing the FMV>Book in real time marks). Buying this stock at $54.00 would be at only 0.8x our 2018 year end book value and even less on an intrinsic value considering the conservatism in depreciating their assets.  This seems to provide a margin of safety to the downside – especially given the nature of the assets (described below) and history of continued book value growth even through the recession. This also translates into around 8.5x this year’s earnings (2018) on a reported basis and 9.0x on a core earnings basis. The difference between the two is primarily the gains on asset sales as they sell around $1 billion of assets a year as part of their operations.  One way to look at the gains is that they are just reversing the over depreciation that depresses core earnings as they depreciate planes faster than their value actually depreciates. Like most financials – the growth of earnings is a function of how management allocates capital and manages the business. They can invest in additional assets when they have attractive returns or sell assets when the market is tight and prices are high and return capital to shareholders by buying back stock.  In this case, the history of this management team is strong – as you can see in the results of the earnings growth (averaging 14%) and book value growth (averaging 17%) and neither with any real draw down to speak of including during the financial crisis. This management team has consistently generated a ROE in the mid teens with a conservative balance sheet – levered now only 2.7x – and the only independent aircraft finance company that is investment grade. I think they can growth book value to around $80-$85 by 2020 and if it traded at just book, then our investment would generate a 17%-19% return.  If it traded to 1.2x (which would be historically high but consistent with the ROE and returns demonstrated) the stock would be $98-$101 or a 26% to 29% compounded return.
Getting to a higher than book value multiple seems realistic.  While there are concerns about the cycle and overproduction, the aircraft leasing business is more attractive through the cycle than many specialty finance segments and arguably deserves a higher multiple.  Looking at returns on assets and returns on equity, aircraft leasing is more stable and predictable than many other niche finance companies that get premium multiples, a gap that should close over time.
While trading close to an average type multiple, as the chart below demonstrates, there is an opportunity to rerate as the industry matures and investors spend more time beginning to really understand the fundamentals.  In addition, stock prices have lagged earnings growth, leading to multiple compression despite strong fundamentals and potential upcoming catalysts.
  The business is relatively stable and predictable given its all under contract/lease.  95% of the company’s revenue through 2020 is already contracted. The company does not take interest rate risk and hedges changes in interest rates.  A 100 bps change in interest rates would only have a $25 million effect ($0.14 per share). In a rising interest rate environment – given the all in yield on a plane is about 13% with current debt costs of about 4%, they would not need to push price much to maintain margins and the alternative of buying vs leasing gets equally more expensive so presumably pricing power remains intact as long as demand is not destroyed.  The obviously offset also being if higher rates are indicative of higher demand then price/values should be higher to meet demand. This is particularly true if stronger global growth is lifting commodities and the emerging economies as that is where most of the incremental demand for aircraft will be. Lastly, it is also likely that in a higher inflationary/higher interest rate environment, the asset value of planes depreciates more slowly especially if the price of new planes is being inflated, thereby increasing the value of the portfolio.
They maintain good liquidity with at least 1.2x the NTM cash needs (which includes cap ex and debt maturities) and usually around 1.5x the NTM.  The business has shown remarkable stability in margins. The basic math on an aircraft is that it is leased at an 11%-12% yield (the younger the avg plane the less the yield because its less depreciated therefore higher denominator vs a more depreciated plane).  The interest cost is about 4% leaving a Net Spread of about 8%-9%. Depreciation runs 5%-6% (lower on younger fleets because it’s a higher denominator), for a consistent 3% Net Margin. 
In a very basic analysis – you can see how a well run company can generate low/mid teens ROE’s from a plane by plane perspective (AER runs 2.7x-3.0x):
The core of the investment thesis rests on the quality of the assets and the quality of the management team – both of which seem high here.  Management is very well regarded and considered the best in their space. They have been smart allocators of capital, having bought back 28% of the shares outstanding since 2015 below book value.  They have also found smart and highly accretive deals to do, like purchasing the aircraft leasing business out of AIG at an attractive price that proved to be a catalyst for the stock. Of note, GE is said to be shopping their aircraft leasing business, which might make for either a smart/accretive deal by Aerocap or a good mark for what these businesses are worth should someone step up and pay more than book for the business.  The elevated debt levels from mid-2014 were the result of the highly accretive AIG deal – which they quickly reduced to below target levels on strong free cash flow and asset sales.
The asset underpinning the book value – planes – seems a good asset to finance.  There are long term secular trends driving air miles flown globally. Since 1986 air traffic has doubled every 15 years – a trend that should continue if not accelerate for the foreseeable future according to all forecasts.  In 2017 global air traffic is growing at 8%. This secular growth is driven by a number of factors. First is the global growth of the middle class which correlates well with air travel (both leisure and business). The global middle class is expected to grow from 2.9 billion people to 4.9 billion people in the next 20 years.  In addition, much of the emerging middle class in coming from countries where the average distance traveled is much further than the existing average distance traveled in mature nations. For instance, travelers in the middle east, India and China have a propensity to travel distances greater than their counterparts in the US (flights from NYC to Chicago, NYC to Boston, DC to Florida…etc are relatively short flights compared with common flights out of Dubai or Hong Kong).  And lastly net fleet increases have not kept up with traffic as airlines have driven efficiency in seating – a game that seems to be coming to a close (ie getting more people on a plane and flying the plane more hours/day). In addition retirements of airplanes have been below normal, signaling that the global fleet has been stretched and aged beyond what is normal. This might have been helped by low fuel prices as it has allowed older less efficient planes remain economical for longer than normal, but over time these trends should regress to the mean and drive further demand as the plane parc stops aging.
In addition to the growing secular trend of global air traffic, there has also been a secular trend for more airlines to lease vs buy aircraft.  This is being driven by several factors. Among the large established air carriers some of this trend is driven by balance sheet concerns and increasing returns on capital for shareholders.  In addition, as air traffic grows in emerging markets, new airlines with less balance sheet power and weaker credits are becoming an important source of growth. For emerging airlines lacking the financing and the strong industry standing to get orders into Boeing and Airbus, they are increasing relying on lease companies like Aercap for their planes.
In thinking about the risks to an investment in Aercap, from a credit perspective, one concern would be the financial stability of the airlines leasing the planes.  One consideration is that airlines are currently in an unprecedented period of profitability. Some argue that airlines have finally discovered that if run correctly, they actually have real businesses.  Seems like even Berkshire has bought into this theory. But as Aercap points out what really matters is that someone is flying planes – its easy to repaint the tail. Planes are easy to take back and replace – they are very liquid assets.  So a failed airline will just have its routes replaced by another airline that needs planes assuming air traffic continues to grow. They point out they grew book value through the financial crisis. In addition, as highlighted below, this is one area that they think they excel at given their size, sophistication and expertise – they can react quicker to any credit issue than any other competitor.
In addition to a strong management team and good demand for the underlying asset that Aercap finances, Aercap has some other unique characteristics that help distinguish it in what most would assume is a rather commodity like industry.  First and foremost is the size and scale of Aercap. This gives it market insight into an otherwise opaque market (private aircraft sales) such that they claim they know better than anyone where demand is, for what planes and at what prices in both the new and used market place.  They claim that information advantage is core to them delivering best in class results – and leads to optimal decision making…Buy/Sale/lease decisions as they manage their portfolio.
Aercap’s focus is on maintaining a liquid portfolio of the most desired planes.  Keeping a conservative cap structure, conservative leasing terms with high security deposits and maintenance reserves and not taking interest rate risk.  As already mentioned Aercap is the only independent aircraft leasing company that is Investment Grade, giving them a financing cost advantage over their competition and many of their customers.  In addition, their size (largest buyer of many versions of aircraft) gets them better pricing and better placement in the order book. For instance, they are the largest buyer of the 787 and made up a lot of the early deliveries.  This puts them in an advantaged position to basically “sell their place in line” to lesser airlines that would need to wait years to get the 787.
Aercap is the world’s most active trader of mid life aircraft, giving it unique insights and abilities to place aircraft.  One example given is there is a current industry concern with the number of widebody jets on order from a select group of Middle Eastern airlines.  In some cases, certain Middle Eastern airlines have more new widebody jets on order than they currently fly and this at a time of weak economic environment in the Middle East driven by low oil prices.  In addition to the large widebody order book, with the ramping of Boeing’s 787 (Dreamliner) and the upcoming revamp of the 777 (Boeing’s most successful widebody plane of the last several decades), investors have been concerned with residual values and demand for existing 777’s in the portfolio.  As the chart below shows, Aercap has successfully placed or sold almost their entire 777 fleet – something they point to as a good example of their expertise and market knowledge.
Another example given was the recent bankruptcy of Berlin Airlines.  Their claim was that most of the lessors or OEMs with aircraft placed with the bankrupt airlines were left waiting around, in part because of pressure from the German government, waiting to see if Deutsche Air was going to assume the leases.  Aercap had the strong leases, expertise and infrastructure to immediately take the planes back, get them out of Germany and placed with other airlines around the world before a single other plane in Berlin Air’s fleet was taken back by another creditor.  As it turns out, Deutsche Air did not take any of the widebody planes, leaving other lessors with unpaid leases for sometime and then they first had to try and begin getting their planes re-placed. 
One reason for this expertise is the business model Aercap has.  They look to trade out of airplanes midway through their life and have extensive networks of investors and contacts that they place hundreds of planes with.  The Aercap business model is to buy airplanes and place them with airlines under 12 year leases. This gives them high visibility into revenue and lets them manage through downturns.  They sell most of their planes within 8-15 years, usually with at least 3-4 years left on lease (or lease extension) mostly to investors looking for stable yield.
Overtime, management can flex their portfolio – buying newer planes to expand and get younger, and selling more planes to shrink the portfolio and return capital and let the average plane age a bit.  Currently, Aercap is in the process of getting the fleet a little younger as it takes deliveries of newer planes – which in theory should make the portfolio more valuable.
  Investment Concerns:
Like all specialty finance companies, Aercap needs access to external financing.  Any debt crisis is an issue. Management tries to mitigate this by always operating with a prudent amount of liquidity to manage through any crisis – assuming that they can re-access capital markets within a reasonable period (2 years or so).  The company itself generates in the area of $3 billion of operating cash flow a year and usually sells around $1-2 billion of aircraft a year – so it internally generates large amounts of cash before cap ex/new plane buys. Furthermore, its average debt maturities roughly matches its average life left on leases (about 6 years) to keep the duration of debt and lease rates consistent.  See debt maturity schedule (below).
  A second consideration would be residual values of planes.  One issue would be an oversupply of planes by OEMs into a market (because of over production or decreased demand as a result of a recession or political/terror concerns) could depress plane values and lease rates leaving residual values below Aercap’s book and making placing/selling planes that are coming off lease book value losses.  Historically this seems to have not been the case and the current demand forecasts seem to lead that supply and demand should be in balance. In addition, Aercap thinks the duopoly structure of the industry has imposed discipline and that the OEM’s are careful to keep the supply well matched with demand. Furthermore, Aercap thinks the development of the aircraft leasing industry has helped stabilize residual values as before the lack of visibility, expertise and liquidity would lead to larger swings in residual values during downturns as assets were dumped into illiquid and unsophisticated markets.  But this remains something to track. Residual values are something to watch. With $34 billion in assets – a 5% change in residual values would lower the book value by about $10/$11 per share or about 19% on its face…ie ($34 bn * 5% / 157 shares) but if you assume book is understated by about 7% on average then the net effect would be about $4.00 less. But the real math is more complicated. First, Aercap is in newer more liquid planes, where moves in residual values are much less than the overall market. Where softness in the industry has the largest effect on residuals is on older planes in a segment where new versions are launching – that was the concern with the 777 within the Aercap portfolio described above and they manage the business to avoid those issues.  The second thing to keep in mind is that Aercap planes are on leases and generally sold with leases attached, so near term fluctuations in residual values have little to no effect on current fundamentals. Should leases need to be signed during a period of panic or weak global conditions, what Aercap did during the recession was sign short term leases at a discount to cover costs on deliveries or planes coming off lease, then look to resign them at better rates for a normal length lease a year or two later. While not optimal, with the fleet under long term contracts and the sale of most planes before they get to the end of its contract or contract extension, there is usually on a relatively small % of planes coming off lease in a given year that have not already been placed of sold, so this effect should not be dramatic but bears watching as the portfolio is in constant motion.  Lastly, it is worth thinking about reported book represents a plane with an average age of about 6 years under a 10-12 year lease. The time frame that residual value would matter most is the end of a lease – or about 6 years later on average. Depreciation is straight line, so the delta between expected residuals (predicted by book) and potential discounted values as a result of a weak market, would be based on the much lower depreciated value of a 10-12 year old plane, not the average book today. Not sure how that exact math would work, but is you assume deprecation is about 6% a year and on average there are 6 more years left on the average lease – the base for a hit to residual values on a like-for-like basis is probably closer to $23 bn than $34 bn such that a 5% hit would be more like $7.00/share and $3.00-$4.00 net of the imbedded conservatism. But will need to verify this calculation with the company.  From the chart below, you can see the weakness in values hits older plane models much more than newer ones. The hit to the 777-300, 787, A-330-300, and 737-900 during the crisis was much less than many of the older models that were facing newer versions in the market place. Aercap has managed through this whole period taking gains on sales – including net gains in 1q 2016. Book value has grown throughout.
In addition, one concern might be the increased competition from easy money looking for yield which could depress margins for what looks like a commodity business from the outside.  Aercap points to the increased interest from Chinese and other Asian banks in the space. But Aercap explains its view that there has always been competition in the space, so that is not new.  It claims most of the easy and “dumber” money goes to sales-leaseback deals, something Aercap has not done in years now because of the lower yields. Those deals are competitively shopped and require less sophistication – more just providing of balance sheet financing to an airline that already has a plane.  Aercap sees their value added in the form of the platform they have built and the expertise they have developed to buy the right planes, place them and then sell them across their network over the course of the plane’s life cycle. The stability of the ROE and margins generated seems to speak to this claim, but again, this is something worth watching.  It does make some sense given the biggest cost to the lessee is basically covering the deprecations. The net margins are not that wide and Aercap has an advantage in being investment grade on the debt costs. The wide network of placing planes helps Aercap with the residual values and high utilization – both competitive advantages and barriers to anyone that wanted to buy hundreds of planes on spec without that knowledge and infrastructure as opposed to a plain vanilla sales-leaseback.

Lastly there is the risk to how the stock trades vs the actual fundamentals.  Although the fundamentals are not correlated, it does seem that these stocks often trade in sympathy with airline stocks, at least over the short term:
  There have been periods of strong drawdowns in the stock – especially in early 2016 when the stock was briefly in a free fall:
  Looking back at the early 2016 time frame – this seems to have been panic driven as a number of overlapping concerns came together:
Boeing and Airbus both announced production issues and delays – which hit their stocks (particularly Boeing).  Ironically, this should be a positive, as less production and a slowdown in the Dreamliner deliveries should have made Aercap’s position more valuable – but people shoot first.  (BA stock chart:)
Although a stock chart of BA post that sell-off seems interesting and does not speak top a pending collapse in the cycle:


There was a growing concern about a China slowdown.  Aercap has about 10% of its portfolio in China – and China is an important source of growth.  Aercap was quick to point out air miles flown was still strong and growing – whether China grew at 4% or 8% and that they had strong demand from their customers there.

There was a concern about air traffic in Russia and Russian airlines going BK especially with the collapse in the Ruble.  Aercap had anticipated this and already reduced its planes in Russia from 90 to 70 on a base of about 1500.

Boeing and Airbus were both having trouble placing end of life aircraft and new versions were about to launch.  This is why Aercap was focused on getting out of the 777 it owns over the last few years.

There was a risk off trade.  URI fell 45%, HTZ fell 65%, MS fell 38%, GS fell 39%, GLNG fell 70%...levered risk assets tied to global growth got hammered and post the AIG deal, Aercap was more levered then.

Couple of interesting points about that period:
Citibank did a FMV analysis plane by plane of Aercap in 1q 2016 and came up with a value still greater than book despite all the panic – which represented almost 50% upside.
The mgt team stepped up with aggressive buys.   The CEO and CFO each bought around 500,000 shares personally.
The company got very aggressive on the share buyback.
As mentioned above – the company continued to realize net gains on sales of aircraft during the period.

This spending shock in turn led to losses in business revenue and layoffs of low-income workers at firms that cater to high income consumers, ultimately reducing their own consumption levels. Because the root cause of the shock appears to be self-isolation driven by health concerns, there is limited capacity to restore economic activity without addressing the virus itself. In particular, we find that state-ordered reopenings of economies have only modest impacts on economic activity; stimulus checks increase spending particularly among low-income households, but very little of the additional spending flows to the businesses most affected by the COVID shock; and loans to small businesses have little impact on employment rates.” https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/tracker_paper.pdf

Alan Greenspan has said that every 10% move in the S&P equates to 1% +/- impact to US GDP.
DESPITE THIS BOOST, CONSUMER SENTIMENT HAS STILL GOTTEN SMASHED AND REMAINS WIDELY DISCONNECTED FROM THE EQUITY MARKETS
“The disconnect between financial markets and the real economy can be illustrated by the recent decoupling between the soaring U.S. equity markets and plunging consumer confidence (two indicators that have historically trended together), raising questions about the rally’s sustainability if not for the boost provided by central banks.
This divergence raises the specter of another correction in risk asset prices should investors’ attitude change, posing a threat to the recovery. So-called bear equity market rallies have occurred in the past during periods of significant economic pressures, only to unwind swiftly.” -IMF, 6/22/2020
POOR DATA HAS NOT BEEN FULLY CAPTURED/REFLECTED IN GOV STATS
“Conducting the surveys that economic data releases are made of in a world where businesses are shuttered by coronavirus containment policies is not easy.  Sample sizes have been reduced, and site visits are not being conducted to find out why. If a national statistical office calls a company and no one answers the phone, the establishment is excluded from the data.”
“This is a problem that we think is leading to an underestimation of the actual decline in economic activity.  If a business with 100 employees fails during a lockdown, no one answers the phone when the national statistical office calls to collect employment data.  So the loss of 100 jobs is not recorded.  
Consider the May retail sales report for Australia:  If ABS calls a retail outlet to ask about activity in May and the store is closed—if no one answers the phone—then the establishment is excluded from that month’s survey result.  However, the right answer should be that this outlet is reporting zero sales.  The survey result will overstate actual sales because the sample under-represents outlets that have failed.”

TRADE WAR ‘VIRUS’ IS ACCELERATING GLOBALLY – FULL EFFECTS HAVE YET TO BE SEEN
Ed Yardeni believes, as do I, that the Great Depression was caused by global trade wars. From Ed Yardeni in his book, ""Predicting the Markets"" -
  ""This outbreak of protectionist sentiments reminded me of a similar outbreak during the late 1920s and early 1930s... the 1920s was a period of globalization, with peace, progress, and prosperity, yet by the early 1930s, the world fell into a depression that was followed by World War II near the end of the decade. My research led me to conclude that the great depression was caused by the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of June 1930... The tariff triggered a deflationary spiral that had a deadly domino effect. Other countries immediately retaliated by imposing tariffs too. The collapse of world trade pushed commodity prices over a cliff. Exporters and farmers defaulted on their loans, triggering a wave of banking crises. The resulting credit crunch caused industrial production and farm output to plunge and unemployment to soar. In my narrative, the depression caused the stock market crash, not the other way around as is the popular belief...” 
  “Historian John Steele Gordon observed that US exports in 1929 were $5.25 billion, whereas by 1933, exports were only $1.68 billion...” 
  “As countries successively raised tariffs, world trade fell by two-thirds from 1929 to 1934.... The producer price index (PPI) for industrial commodity prices plummeted 24% from June 1930 until it bottomed during April 1933.""

Moody’s analysis indicates tightening of bank credit is going to drive increased defaults, which is going to drive a decline in equity prices. 
  Tighter Supply of Bank Credit to Businesses Widens Spreads and Warns of More Defaults 
The willingness of banks to supply credit to businesses deteriorated considerably at the start of 2020’s second quarter. According to a Federal Reserve survey of bank loan officers, the net percent of responding banks tightening standards on commercial and industrial loans jumped up from the 0.0 percentage points of 2020’s first quarter to the 41.5 points of the second quarter. During the Great Recession, the net percent of banks tightening business loan standards peaked at fourth-quarter 2008’s record high of 83.6 points. 
The simple unweighted average of the net percent of banks tightening C&I loan standards and the net percent widening C&I loan spreads shows a high correlation with a composite high-yield bond spread. This indicator of the tightness of the supply of bank credit to businesses jumped up from first-quarter 2020’s -10.4 points to the second-quarter’s +41.2 points. The tightness of the bank supply of business credit previously climbed to 41.2 points during 2008’s first half, 2000’s second half, and 1990’s third quarter. Like the current situation, each of the three previous episodes either overlapped a recession or was just prior to recession’s arrival. Moreover, each of the three previous episodes was followed by a substantially wider high-yield bond and a higher speculative-grade default rate.
The index of the tightness of the bank supply of business credit also serves as a very meaningful leading indicator of the U.S. high-yield default rate. For example, the default rate generates very high correlations of 0.90 and 0.89 with the tightness of the bank supply of business credit from three and four quarters earlier. The median high-yield default rate was 10.5% a year after the tightness of the supply of business credit previously reached second-quarter 2020’s 41.2 points.
When the default rate was soaring from a December 2007 low of 1.0% to a November 2009 peak of 14.7%, the month-long average of the market value of U.S. common stock had plunged by as much as 42.1% from its year earlier average in March 2009.

APL Apollo Tubes (APL) is an interesting play on investing in India's building products sector. APL is the largest player in the structural tubes segment, and while structural tubes might seem like a commodity, the company has built moats around it to dominate the market. The company has about 40% market share, which is only expected to increase going forward with weak competition and an aggressive management that has demonstrated a strong track record of expanding the business, introducing new products to expand the market, and building the lowest production cost facilities across the country.  I believe APL is an attractive long-term investment opportunity to participate in a structural industry, where we can expect 15-20% earnings cagr and multiple rerating. 
Company info and history:
APL is India’s largest manufacturer of structural tubes, with ~40% market share in a fragmented industry. It has a capacity of 2.5mtpa with a pan-India presence; 10 manufacturing units, 29 warehouses, 800 distributors, and a strong dealer network with over 40k retail touchpoints. The real journey for APL started after Sanjay Gupta took over the business in 2002. Since then the company has added capacity at 20%+ cagr (including inorganic expansion) and its revenue has grown at over 35%+ cagr. Company has done 5 acquisitions since 2008, and post the acquisition of these plants, the company has then increased the plant capacity significantly (0.6mtpa capacity at the time of acquisition which has expanded to 1.3mpta through brownfield expansion). APL has also been at the forefront of launching most of India’s first niche products within the structural steel segment and has helped expand the end-use applications of the product. 
  Industry:
Structural tubes are a subset of Electric Resistance Welded (ERW) pipes. Until about a decade and a half ago they were mostly used to transport water, sewage, and oil/gas, but of late they have found new applications as structural support systems for modern infrastructures. Currently, the structural steel industry is estimated to be around 4mtpa and has grown at ~8% cagr (over 1x GDP in the last 5 years). The current structural steel adoption is very low in India (about 4% of total steel consumed vs about 9% for developed countries). Going forward, with increasing use cases and higher usage of steel in residential and commercial buildings, the demand for structural steel is expected to grow ~10% cagr from 4mt in fy20 to 5.4mt in fy25. Structural steel tubes are mostly used in residential and commercial building applications (40% and 30%, respectively); infrastructure accounts for about 25% of total consumption.   
Investment thesis:
Gaining market share in a growing industry segment: Structural steel tube industry is gaining acceptability for increasing residential and commercial building applications along with infrastructure applications. Currently, the street is expecting the structural tube industry to grow at ~10% CAGR. Within the industry, APL is gaining market share. Company’s market share has improved from 29% in FY16 to about 40% in FY20. I believe the market share should continue to increase due to its pan-India presence, excess capacity (current capacity utilization is around 65%), ability to provide customized and low volume products to customers, and continuous product innovations. Just in the last few years, the company has launched quite a few niche value-added products like Signature (designer roofing, fencing, and steel furniture), Chaukhat (steel door frames to replace traditional wooden door frames), Alpha (window steel frames), Elegant (designer steel hand railings), Tricoat (electrical conduits), Plank (staircase steps, ceilings, etc).
  Good experienced management team with risk-taking ability: After Sanjay Gupta took the reins of the company in 2002, he has managed to aggressively grow the company by not just increasing capacity but also by being the early adopter of new technologies, introducing new products to the market, building brand around a normally commoditized product, and doing backward integration to reduce the cost of the entire value chain. Management is highly passionate about the business and wants to be by far the single largest player in the market. Management understands that economies of scale play an important role in a low margin business and that the huge cost advantage they will gain will deter newer players from entering the business.
  Margins improvement possibility: Company is working on many angles to improve margins including i) increasing the portion of high margin value-added products, ii) focus on reducing cost, and iii) Improving branding to sell products at a premium.  
 Currently, the revenue contribution from high-margin products (DFT-hollow sections, GI pipes, GP pipes, and Tricot products) is about 35% (from 30% in FY17) and this should increase to ~50% over the next 4-5 years. The EBITDA/ton for high margin products is about 3x more than low margin products. EBITDA/ton for the low margin commoditized products like MS-Black and Hollow section is about Rs 1350, while for the high-value products it can range from Rs 2,500-6,000, and so the shift towards high-value products will significantly improve their operating profits on a per ton basis.
Secondly, the management clearly understands that in low margin products, only the lowest cost producers can survive in the long-run and so APL is highly focused on reducing its production cost per ton. APL is able to get the lowest raw material (HRC steel) prices and best working capital terms among its peers because it is by far the largest customer among its peers. APL has 40% market share, while #2 and #3 players have about ~12% and 10% market share. APL buys about 2% of India’s steel consumption and about 10% of India’s HRC steel, which gives it much higher bargaining power. Additionally, the company has recently adopted Direct forming technology (DFT), which allows the company to mill pipes of any size and shape (round, square, and rectangle) and the process is highly automated compared to conventional technology, which is used by peers. This saves the company about 2-10% on raw material when compared with conventional technology. With conventional technology, one needs to first mill the pipes into round shapes and then give them a square or rectangular shape. Also, the size of the pipes milled using the conventional technology was limited and any change in the milling size would require the entire set up to be manually reconfigured, which can take up to 2days. With the DFT technology, this process is automated and there is very little downtime. But the cost of this technology is about 10x that of conventional technology, and so the smaller players are not able to afford it.
In India, many commodity products such as paints, plastic pipes, consumer staples, etc, the branded players have a huge pricing advantage over the unbranded players. Branding of such commodity products is required to distinguish the quality of products and the applications of new products launched. The company’s management understands this, and so has been focusing on building its brand over the last few years. Company has been spending about Rs 500m per year (~6% of gross profits) for the last 2 years on advertisements to promote its brand and new product launches.  
  Increasing the company’s moat has been a key focus for the management. In a low margin business, management understands the importance of economies of scale and hence has built massive capacity across the country with a wide distribution network. Company has done backward integration and deployed the best manufacturing technology to make sure it has the lowest cost of production. Additionally, the management has taken the initiative to launch new products in the market to expand the industry size and provide the best quality products. When we did some channel checks with small residential and commercial builders in a few Tier-2 cities, we were surprised to find out that the small-time contractors were brand conscious and preferred to use APL pipes over local brands despite having to pay a small premium. Few other things that the builders appreciated were the high range of size and shapes that they could find with APL. On the other hand, when we checked with some retailers and distributors, they preferred to sell APL products given they didn’t need to store high inventory (APL warehouses in the vicinity were able to replenish products within 1-2 days).  
  Potential improvements in ROIC/ROEs:  While improving margins will help improve returns, the company has a lot of room to improve its asset turn. Currently, the company’s capacity utilization is about 65% and with no new capacity expected for the next 1-2years, the improving utilization will help increase the asset turn. But most importantly, the company is focused on improving its working capital cycle. Company expects to reduce its receivable days from 23 in FY20 to about 10days in FY21 by focusing on cash sales. On the inventory side, the company wants to reduce its inventory from 38days to about 30days. So a 20days reduction in their working capital cycle can improve their returns from 18% to 27% in about 2 years.
  Valuation is attractive: APL is currently trading at about 33x this year’s earnings and about 23x next year’s street estimates.  While on the surface, the valuation might look expensive, the valuation is actually attractive for these reasons: i) Industry penetration is low; the applications for structural tubes is increasing; the industry is expected to grow at least 10% cagr; within the industry, APL is expected to increase its market share, ii) operating profits and earnings are expected to grow faster than topline due to ability to increase margins as discussed previously, iii) company is the dominant industry player and has a strong moat, which is only increasing, iv) In India, companies like Asian Paints, Berger Paints, Astral Poly Technik are trading over 50x earnings, because these companies have converted commodity categories like paints and plastic pipes into pseudo consumer brands, because of they have strong brand recall and carry pricing power.  
  Competitive advantages over peers:
Raw material cost advantage: company is able to source HRC steel at the lowest price compared to peers due to its scale, and this gives the company about 1-2% cost advantage. Additionally, after the adoption of DFT, its wastage portion has dropped giving it another 2%+ saving on the raw material.   
Pan India presence and strong distribution network affords cost-benefit: Steel tubes/pipes are very bulky to transport and so having regional manufacturing plants provides a strong advantage. Additionally having a wide network of warehouses allows it to reduce the inventory level at distributors and retailers, which reduces the working capital cycle of the supply-chain – this they can exchange for better pricing/lower distribution margins.  
Strong product portfolio: APL has over 1.5k SKUs, which it is able to produce due to its advanced production facilities. For about 40% of its portfolio, they have no competition – these are typically low volume but high margin products.   
Strong balance sheet and aggressive management: Company’s balance sheet is strong with about Rs 3bn of net debt or less than 1x EBIT, despite expanding capacity aggressively and doing 5 acquisitions in the last 12years. Management is not shy of investing in technology and doing strategic acquisitions to increase its competitive edge. 
Competition is weak: There are a few small players in the organized space. Surya Roshni is the #2 player with about 10% market share but they have a lot of other businesses and within the pipe segment the company is focused mostly on water transportation. Hi-tech pipes and Rama Steel have about 7% market share each but both are saddled with high debt levels.  APL has about 800 distributors while Hi-tec has about 350 and Surya Roshni has about 250. When we look at the receivable days, APL’s RC days are about 28, while for Hitec and Surya Roshni it is about 37 and 51days, respectively. 
  Risks: 
Steel price volatility: Company is affected by steel price fluctuations. While the company is able to pass on the increase in steel prices to customers (typically with a few month lag), the fluctuations can impact their inventory gains/losses, working capital, and if steel prices increase significantly then customers might look for alternatives products. 
New entrants: While existing players are weak, new upstream players with a strong balance sheet might consider entering this business. 
APL Tricoat: Company currently owns about 55% stake in this subsidiary. APL Tricoat (separately listed) is positioned towards the value-added products and has a much higher margin compared to APL. APL’s management has stated its intentions to increase its stake in Tricoat, but the valuation gap between the two companies has forced the management to delay their plans. Currently, any A&P spent by APL is disproportionately benefiting Tricoat. 
I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise do not hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

DRD Gold takeover imminent
  In July 2018 DRD acquired a number of gold dumps and metallurgical plants from
Sibanye-Stillwater for 265m DRD shares (equivalent to 26.5m ADR’s). Among these
assets was the high grade Driefontein 5 dump, which has since been brought into
production, producing 60k ozs p.a. at a cash cost of $700/oz with a capex cost of a mere
$23.3m.
  As part of the deal, Sibanye was also granted an option to increase its shareholding in
DRD from 38.1% to 50.1% at a 10% discount to the 30-day VWAP at any time up
to/prior to July 31, 2020. That option was exercised this week at a cost of $76.3m
equivalent to $4.54 per ADR.
  We now expect Sibanye to launch a bid for the remaining 49.9% of the company’s
shares. In the event of a full bid, minorities will benefit from the fact that DRD is
domiciled in South Africa, where appraisal rights are extremely powerful, swift, and
cheap to enforce.
  The current rating is undemanding at a TEV of 4.4 x our forecast EBITDA to June and
3.7 x forward. The valuation doesn’t discount any potential production growth from the
other Driefontein, Kloof, Libanon & Venterspost dumps. Given the remarkably short
payback period on the current DP2 Plant, it should be fairly easy to roll out a second
modular production line at the second existing, mothballed Driefontein plant.
  Investors can therefore look forward to an Interim dividend of 30c or more per ADR to
be declared in the next 3 weeks. A possible reduction of capital of 88.3c (tax-free) may
be announced by March. Interim results will be released on February 12.
  Why Sibanye is likely to buy out the DRD minorities
At the time that Sibanye sold its dumps to DRD in 2018, the group’s balance sheet was
under severe strain after the all-cash acquisition of Stillwater. The transaction with DRD
converted dormant assets on the balance sheet into a liquid marked-to-market asset.
  Since then, Sibanye has benefited from its exposure on its palladium and rhodium side,
while it shut several loss-making gold shafts. This has structurally improved the metrics
of the balance sheet, but at the same time has left it significantly underweight gold.
  DRD represents a lower risk exposure to the gold cycle than Sibanye’s labor intensive,
deep level mines and will improve the average cost of production of the gold division.
DRD also has significant untapped ore reserves and resources that can be brought on
stream at affordable capex, and in short turn around times, should the bull market in gold
be sustained.
  Having exercised the subscription option, Sibanye will likely seek to remedy its financial
and tax inefficiencies.
 
DRD clearly has no use for the ~$110m in net cash, while its dump operations are
earning $8m of EBITDA per month and has no material capex requirements. It’s also
illogical for DRD to hold large positive cash balances while Sibanye is servicing
significant high interest-bearing loans. With the recent reduction in Sibanye’s debt
covenant ratios, the group could do worse than to acquire cash, and high-quality earnings
for an issue of shares.
  While the compartmentalizing of the Driefontein dumps under DRD was a shrewd
exercise to monetize dormant assets in 2018 and to finance the capex to turn the dumps to
account, the structure itself is tax inefficient.
  The status quo means that the Driefontein dumps are being taxed at full company rates
inside DRD, while Sibanye’s contiguous Driefontein underground shafts have unutilized
tax credits as a result of unredeemed capital expenditure.
  DRD also has industry leading expertise in dumps, while Sibanye has significant
remaining gold dumps in the Free State province, as well as platinum and chrome dumps
near Rustenburg, and at Stillwater in Montana. By applying DRD’s skills, these dumps
can add high quality ounces to the group, thus improving the viability of these potential
operations.
    Why the offer for DRD is imminent
Sibanye-Stillwater CEO, Neal Froneman is a seasoned campaigner, with a very keen
sense of timing. Sibanye’s stock has re-rated massively on the back of the palladium rally
– from ~$2 in August 2018 to its current price of ~$10. It is therefore an opportune
moment to strengthen the balance sheet by acquiring debt-free, quality assets.
  Sibanye’s year-end is December. By announcing the acquisition in the next few weeks,
Froneman will be able to present the annual results with pro-forma figures inclusive of
DRD.
    DRD Management Incentive Scheme
DRD shareholders approved a new “Long-Term” Management Incentive Scheme at the
DRD AGM in December last year. (see Notice of AGM, p.26).
  In summary the scheme is to provide DRD management with options that vest
immediately and fully in the event of a take-over of the company. It is a virtual carbon
copy of the Management Incentive Scheme implemented at Lonmin PLC in early 2019,
just before Sibanye acquired the company under a grossly undervalued Scheme of
Arrangement.
  One can therefore safely assume that a full take-over is not only likely, but imminent. As
with Lonmin, Sibanye will be able to rely on DRD’s Board and Management to be vocal
in their support of the excellent merits of their offer.
 
    Appraisal Rights in South Africa
DRD is a South African domiciled company and dissenting shareholders are therefore
able to invoke their appraisal rights, which is a channel to allow aggrieved minorities to
defend their interests without significant costs.
  Section 164 of the new Companies Act of 2008 contains clear, and powerful rights for
dissenting shareholders. These rights have been further strengthened by the positive
judgments in three successive court cases, the most notable of which was Cilliers vs La
Concorde Holdings Ltd., in which the judge ruled that that the courts will seek to provide
“effective recourse” to “smaller investors” to ensure that the Constitutional “principles of
equality and fairness … and access to information” shall be adhered to, hereby protecting
the interests of smaller investors.
  What makes the system so valuable is the simplicity of the process, clear cut timetables
and low costs. The Act and the judgments have created a framework in which dissenters
have an upside-only scenario, with the outcome of the process typically determined in 2-8
months, depending on whether the bidding company plays hard ball or not.
  Investors can therefore rest assured that a low-ball bid for DRD will not result in their
expropriation, as happened in the case of Sibanye’s scheme of arrangement acquisition of
the UK-domiciled Lonmin PLC last year.
    Background
DRD Gold transitioned from an operator of marginal underground gold mines to being
the largest pure play producer of gold from mine dumps in the world. The latter occurred
in two steps. The first step was the acquisition of Crown, that was previously operated by
Rand Mines, and the recommissioning of Ergo, that was previously operated by
Anglogold.
  The second step was the 2018 transaction with Sibanye.
  The business model is economically robust, and fulfills a vital social function by cleaning
up dozens of small, environmentally problematic historic dumps, and consolidating the
fresh residue into a single, large compliant dump. This results in a marked improvement
in the quality of life and health of the surrounding communities, and allows the
previously occupied land to be redeveloped as industrial real estate.
  As the last man standing in the greater Johannesburg area, DRD also has the benefit of
being the only buyer able to effectively extract value from derelict dumps.
DRD’s Ore Reserve inventory of 5.77m ozs (June 2019) of owned dumps therefore
doesn’t do justice to its de facto access to a much larger list of dumps that are still extant
in this prolific gold province. This is especially relevant in a gold bull market, or during
times of weakness in the Rand (local currency) exchange rate to the US Dollar.
 
    Recent results
DRD released strong production figures for the 6 months to December. The company
produced 97,643 ozs during this period. The guidance for the year to June 2020 is only
190,000 ozs, which we expect DRD to exceed.
  Production in the September quarter was 48,001 ozs, rising to 49,642 ozs in the
December quarter. The latest quarterly improvement was achieved despite the following
3 factors;
1. The traditional seasonal weakness during the December quarter, when operations
are affected by heavy rains and electric storms that force temporary safety
stoppages on the exposed dumps
2. The cessation of production at Ergo’s Fine Grind Circuit during the quarter, to
determine if this high cost plant is cost effective or not, and lastly
3. The significant load shedding by Eskom (South African national electricity public
utility) during the latest quarter.
  We are particularly bullish about the Fine Grind Circuit being taken off-line. This plant is
both capex and opex intensive and has never delivered on its designed unlock of occluded
gold in the pyrite encrusted particles in the ore. We believe that Ergo’s costs can be
reduced by as much as 10% per ounce by the cessation of fine grinding.
  If our thesis is correct, then the Interim results that will be announced on February 12,
will not only show the benefit of the sharp reduction of costs at Ergo, but should contain
a materially positive production surprise from the low-cost Driefontein plant. In other
words, DRD’s Interim earnings could surprise significantly to the upside.
    Looking forward
In the attached model, the impact of the new Driefontein plant as well as the stronger
gold price is clearly visible in the transformation of DRD’s fortunes.
  In line with the discussion above, we forecast production to continue improving to beat
guidance of 190,000 ozs this financial year by approximately 8,000 ozs. This should be
well within reach, based on the strong December quarter.
  On that basis we forecast EBITDA of $95m for F2020 and $112m for the year to June
2021. These forecasts make no allowance for any cost benefits from the possible
termination of Ergo’s Fine Grind Circuit or for the impact of Driefontein production
running at the upper end of the plant’s capacity.

Thesis Punchline
I believe Fair Isaac Corp (FICO) is a uniquely dominant franchise with two under-earning profit streams both deserving scarcity value in today’s low interest rate environment. The “Scores” business is a royalty-based monopoly with a tremendous pricing power runway that can justify the stock’s valuation alone, which means you are getting the digital decisioning software business for free. The nose-bleeding headline valuation (35x FY2021 Consensus EPS) has scared many investors away over the years, yet it is actually what creates the opportunity if you are willing to look underneath the hood – because FICO’s software businesses are going through a heavy investment phase through both On-Prem-to-SaaS conversion and product development (such that the valuable Decision Management Software sub-segment is currently loss-making). With the appropriate valuation framework, I believe the stock has 50% upside to its intrinsic value over the next 18 months and can continue to compound at a low-teen % IRR from there.
  Background
FICO operates in the global predictive analytics industry with two businesses. The first business is FICO Scores business, and that is widely used by major financial institutions in the US to make all sorts of consumer credit decisions. The second business provides software and solutions to help businesses both manage and optimize their decision-making processes when it comes to credit origination, monitoring and CRM.
FICO Scores is the fastest-growing segment, accounting for 36% of revenue and ~70% of Adj EBITDA before unallocated corporate costs. It offers a range of general purpose and industry specific scoring solutions. In fact, over 90% of the lending decisions made by major financial institutions are based on FICO scores. 75% of Scoring service is distributed B2B – through major credit bureaus (like Experian), while the other 25% come from FICO’s B2C offering.
FICO Software consists of two reported segments – Applications (52% of revenue) and Decision Management Software (DMS, 12% of revenues). Applications offers pre-configured decision management applications that are designed and tailored for specific business problems – such as credit origination, fraud / security management, customer acquisition, etc.   DMS offers tools that can be used to incorporate customized analytics and decision management solutions into customers’ existing business processes. These two businesses should be viewed as a collective software solution segment, given DMS conceptually offers many of the same products Application segment but with more modern architecture and greater configurability.
  Thesis Details
1) While the base volume of FICO Scores is tied to general consumer credit activities (grows slightly faster than GDP), this business has tremendous runway for continued pricing increases that can continue to drive super-normal profit growth
Scores generated extremely strong adjusted organic growth (adjusted for ASC 605 to 606 transition noise) of 16.4%, 10.5%, 29.4% and 25.4% in FY2016, FY2017, FY2018, and FY2019 – you may ask: how the heck did it do that?
Before 2018, FICO hadn’t changed Mortgage Score’s pricing in ~25 years because Credit Bureaus prevented pricing increases – subsequently FICO renegotiated with Credit Bureaus to get “pricing power” back, and decided to hike price up to equate to the value it offers
Ever since, it has used “special pricing” increases to drive enormous revenue growth at ~100% incremental margin – first in Mortgage Scores, then Auto Scores, now moving onto Credit Card Scores
Since FICO Scores’ costs represent just a tiny fraction of the cost of an entire credit underwriting process (from less than 1 penny to 50 cents depending on the applications / use cases of the particular Scores), there has been absolutely no customer pushback.
There is real durability of above-inflation price increases, as the company is still in the early-to-mid innings of the “special price” increase game. FICO mgmt is committed to evaluating every type of Score and taking surgical approach to extract value from all possible channels. There are also inflationary escalators in these contracts.
This business is essentially a high-margin monopoly (~85% EBITDA margin) with 90%+ market share in B2B credit scoring despite having competition in non-Mortgage markets. VantageScore (owned by a bunch of money center banks) is a competitor but has not materially impacted FICO’s market share, volume or revenues over the years
Watch out for strong mortgage volume this year given the low interest rate environment (lots of refi’s in Q1)
Note: FICO’s strong 16.4% revenue growth in 2016 benefited from its new B2C product launch called myFICO (contributed ~900bps to growth that year), that was before pricing was part of the thesis
2) Given the business quality and comparable multiples, FICO’s Scores business itself can justify the stock’s valuation alone
FICO has a habit of guiding extremely conservative on its Scores business, because it excludes benefit from special pricing
o In 2016, it guided to Scores growth of 3-4%, achieved 16%
o In 2017, it guided to Scores growth of 5%, achieved 11%
o In 2018, it guided to Scores growth of MSD%+, it achieved 29%
o In 2019, it guided to Scores growth of ~10%, it achieved +25%
o For 2020, FICO is guiding to ~8% Scores growth….I think it will be another 20%+ revenue growth year for Scores given Mortgage Refi boom and Credit Card pricing hike
One can get to almost $12 of “Scores” earning power per share by 2022 if we load 50% of unallocated corporate costs onto Scores segment and load all the interest expense on Scores given it is a more leverageable asset
Who are the right comps of FICO? I’d argue they are the likes of MSCI, VRSK and VRSN – those are a collection of businesses that share similarities to FICO Scores business – they either own proprietary indices with high margins, possesses unreplicable risk analytics through data assets, or have regulated monopoly to operate .com registry with meaningfully above-inflation pricing power.  MSCI has traded at an average forward P/E of ~29x over the past 5 years, and that multiple is ~27x and ~28x for VRSK and VRSN, respectively. I will caveat that FICO Scores business has grown revenues and EBITDA at a faster clip than all those 3 peers over the past 3-4 years, but FICO does carry more cyclical risks
Valuation: Using the average of ~28x, we get to $327 per share for FICO’s Scores business by FYE2021 – or by September next year, vs. current stock price of $310. This implies a triangulated EV/2022 EBITDA of ~21x, also reasonable compared to those comps
    3) FICO’s Software business is undergoing a cloud transition, with weak current profitability due to high investment cadence, but growth could accelerate soon with a growing TAM
This is a highly recognized asset. Gartners ranks FICO’s digital decisioning system in the leader category with strong current offering and strong strategy in its magic quadrant – best in class among a dozen peers
Both Applications and DMS segments are undergoing cloud transitions as FICO has made more of its Software solutions available as hosted solutions through the FICO Analytic Cloud and/or AWS
Cloud-based software revenues account for 37% of total Software revenues, while On-Premise account for 63% of the revenues (still the majority)
The growth rates between the two are very different
Cloud piece: grew +19% in 2018, +12% in 2019, estimated to grow at 20%+ going forward. Recent booking trends were very robust
On-Prem piece: declined 9% in 2018, +11% in 2019, estimated to gradually decline in LSD to MSD % going forward
2019 Cloud bookings grew at ~double the pace of on-premise bookings
FICO has been very excited about its DMS Product Map, but the segment is currently loss-making due to investments
FICO believes DMS will open its TAM to more than financial companies – there is growing demand to augment and automate business decisions. In fact, management believes “every interaction for every B2C company on the planet could benefit from using our optimization of that interaction software”
DMS is supposed to eventually host all of FICO’s software offerings – providing a single underlying cloud architecture
Product roll-out progress is very good so far as most of the desired applications and core functionality will be available on the platform by year-end
DMS bookings grow +90% YoY in 2019
All these changes have dragged down profitability for the combined Software business, as EBITDA has been negatively impacted by higher investments in both the new Decision Management Software suite/platform have + Cloud transition
Mgmt did confirm that peak of the investment phase is already here, so spending should begin to moderate
As Cloud continues to scale, FICO will find efficiencies around development cost, standardization, etc
  4) As Cloud transition continues to accelerate and we get past the investment phase, Software EBITDA can more than double between 2019 and 2022, justifying 1/3 of existing valuation
I believe cloud delivery will be ~60% of Software revenue mix and DMS would make up 30% of revenue mix by 2022
2019 was the first year of Software EBITDA growth since investment cycle started, going forward the incremental margin will be higher on additional revenue growth, leading to sharp EBITDA margin expansion for the next few years for the combined segment (less 50% of FICO’s unallocated corporate costs)
Valuation: putting 7x EV/Revenue on 2022 Cloud revenues (~23x look-through EBITDA at 30x normalized margin), 3.5x EV/Revenue on 2022 On-Premise revenues, and burdening its share of corporate costs at the blended implied EBITDA multiple (21x), we can get to an EV of $3.4bn for the Software business, or $112 per share
    In conclusion, I believe FICO will reach an intrinsic value of $462 per share (+50%) over the next 18 months, consisting of $327 from Scores, $112 from Software, and $23 per share of interim FCF of $700mm (that is typically used to repurchase shares)
 I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise do not hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

SUMMARY
Chef’s Warehouse (“CHEF”) seems to be a posterchild of the euphoric “reopen rally” and “dash to trash”.  More specifically, CHEF is a commodity business (distribution) selling a commodity product (food) to a decimated customer base (fine dining & upscale casual independent restaurants in urban markets).  Yet, CHEF’s share price has risen > 450% since its March low as shareholders seem to expect a very rapid recovery.  For the reasons below, I believe a quick rebound to 2019 earnings is unlikely and therefore CHEF’s share price has substantial downside.
  PRICED AT A SIGNIFICANT PREMIUM TO THE INDUSTRY LEADER
CHEF mgmt provided 2020 guidance in Jan’20 and then updated that guidance in Feb’20. The Feb’20 update incorporated two acquisitions that closed in late Jan & early Feb.  Annualizing these acquisitions and adding to CHEF’s reported 2019 results implies pro forma 2019 EBITDA of $97mm.  Assuming this hypothetical $97mm of EBITDA, CHEF’s 2020 guide for D&A, SBC & tax rate, estimated interest expense given current cap structure, and diluted shares after the May equity offering, I estimate the company’s pro forma 2019 EPS is ~$0.70 implying CHEF currently trades for ~28x. 
  For perspective, the largest & arguably best food distributor, Sysco (“SYY”), has historically traded for ~20x EPS and currently trades for ~20x 2019 EPS.  Due to SYY’s diversification across customer types & geographies, massive scale (industry leader with ~30x more sales than CHEF) and higher growth (2015-2019 EPS CAGR of 18% vs. CHEF’s 7%), I think SYY should command a premium to CHEF’s multiple and therefore CHEF should trade < 20x EPS.  More importantly, I believe it will be many years before CHEF actually reports my hypothetical pro forma 2019 EPS so CHEF should not be valued off this metric. 
  CHEF UNLIKELY TO ACHIEVE PRO FORMA 2019 REVENUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE
Historically, CHEF’s distribution to upscale casual and fine dining independent restaurants in large cities was a tailwind but that appears to have shifted into a major headwind.  CHEF’s 2019 10K reveals that ~25% of revenue comes from the New York/Boston market.  Both 1Q20 acquisitions are also based in Boston, so NY/Boston now represents > 35% of CHEF’s revenue.  Based on responses to an SEC query (filed 11.16.19) and adjusting for recent acquisitions, I estimate CHEF receives another ~20% of revenue from other East Coast markets (includes Philly, DC, and Miami), ~25% from the West Coast (includes LA, San Fran, Vegas, and Seattle) and ~20% from the Midwest/TX (includes Chicago, Dallas, and Houston).  Most of these cities have been severely impacted by COVID and now the George Floyd protests.  Based on OpenTable, I estimate reservations in CHEF’s markets remain down a weighted average of > 85%. 
  According to an April survey by the James Beard Foundation, only 20% of restaurants in shutdown cities were “very certain or somewhat certain” that they could survive until normal operations resume.  To be clear, many independent restaurants have razor-thin margins at full capacity so < 75% capacity will certainly not be “normal”.  As one restaurant owner explained, many restaurants are only surviving right now because of deferred rent and government stimulus.  But as these benefits come to an end, he anticipated a “restaurant apocalypse” with many independent restaurants permanently closing. 
  In addition to the recent shutdowns, COVID is having a long-term impact with many Americans now relocating from the cities to the suburbs.  This is a trend that should shrink CHEF’s market opportunity and extend the timeframe necessary to return to pro forma 2019 revenue. 
  Furthermore, I believe the current crisis will result in CHEF ceding market share instead of gaining it.  Yes, some of its smaller competitors will go out of business, but CHEF faces multiple larger competitors.  Relative to CHEF’s pro forma 2019 revenue of < $2b, its public peers (SYY, US Foods, and Performance Food Group) each have $30-60b of sales.  Amongst private peers, I believe at least two produce > $14b of annual food distribution revenue (Gordon Food Service and McLane) and at least two more generate ~$3b of annual sales (Ben E Keith and Shamrock Foods).  These larger food distributors also sell to large restaurant chains, but earn their highest margins on independent restaurants.  Now, all of these competitors will likely be fighting over a smaller independent restaurant market.  
  Also, CHEF claims to be unique due to the depth and breadth of its food products, but restaurants are cutting menu items/SKUs so CHEF’s supposed differentiation is becoming far less relevant.  To be clear, CHEF’s 2019 revenue mix consisted of ~45% center-of-plate proteins, ~20% dry goods, ~15% pastry, ~15% dairy/eggs, and ~5% oils/supplies so I don’t think the company’s offering is that unique.  Plus, given restaurants will be struggling to earn a profit due to capacity constraints and lower demand, they will likely be pressuring their distributors to cut prices.  As a result, CHEF could lose volume to both larger & desperate smaller distributors able & willing to offer lower prices OR CHEF could be forced to lower prices & therefore collect lower revenue.
  In short, I don’t foresee CHEF rebounding to pro forma 2019 revenue for many years due to significant closures of independent restaurants in urban markets, consumers fleeing these areas, a more competitive landscape, diminished product differentiation, and pricing pressure from restaurants.
  LOWER REVENUE SHOULD RESULT IN FAR LOWER PROFITS
On CHEF’s 1Q20 call, mgmt claimed only ~33% of operating expenses are fixed but I have my doubts.  First off, mgmt wouldn’t disclose this when asked on CHEF’s 1Q18 call.  More importantly, SYY stated 33% of its operating expenses are fixed but it owns ~80% of its distribution centers and trucks.  Meanwhile, CHEF leases > 95% of its DCs and fleet so the company’s leases and therefore fixed costs should be much higher than SYY.  Nonetheless, I conservatively assume only 33% of CHEF’s operating expenses are fixed.  Coupled with assuming CHEF recaptures 90% of its pro forma 2019 revenue by 2022 (which seems unlikely), flat gross margin, SBC declines w/EBITDA, flat D&A, flat interest expense, and 28% tax rate, I estimate the company would still only be generating ~$0.30 of 2022 EPS implying CHEF trades > 60x P/E.
  Supporting my estimates is the fact that a key to distribution is route density.  This is particularly true for CHEF with an average order value of only $1k (per 11.16.19 filing).  It is unlikely CHEF’s restaurant customers will close in clusters of a geographic region.  Instead, each region will likely have fewer restaurants.  Therefore, CHEF should need the same number of drivers, trucks and distribution centers to serve its regions but will have fewer customers going forward.  Clearly, lower revenue over the same fixed costs equates to less profitable routes and lower profit margins. 
  On top of route density, another key to distribution is scale.  With lower revenue, CHEF should have less purchasing power so its suppliers will likely charge more per product, which should reduce CHEF’s gross margins (though not factored into my 2022 estimate) and further squeeze CHEF’s profit margins.
  ACQUISITIONS & GROWTH INITIATIVES ADD RISK TO CHEF’S TURNAROUND
As discussed above, CHEF closed two acquisitions just weeks before COVID decimated the restaurant industry.  Based on combined annual revenue of ~$225mm, these acquisitions represent mgmt’s largest ever.  Mgmt will now be trying to integrate these acquisitions during a very challenging environment.  Furthermore, CHEF was in the process of expanding its warehouses on the West Coast and installing a new ERP system across its disparate businesses.  Mgmt has put the integrations, expansions, and ERP implementation on pause, but I doubt they can delay these projects for too long.  I think the distraction of successfully executing these initiatives further reduces the chances that CHEF will return to pro forma 2019 profits for the foreseeable future, especially given management’s track record as highlighted below.
  CHEF MANAGEMENT HASN’T PROVEN THEY CAN ORCHESTRATE A SHARP RECOVERY IN PROFITS
CHEF last reported a ~7% EBITDA margin in 2013.  Since then, mgmt has been promising a return to 7% margins but was still not close as of 2019 (~5.5% margin).  In Nov’14, mgmt indicated CHEF would approach 7% margin at $1.2b revenue.  CHEF reached ~$1.2b of revenue in 2016, yet margin remained at ~5%.  In Jun’17, mgmt outlined reaching 7% margin by 2020 but guided to < 6% before COVID.  Due to margin degradation, CHEF mgmt increased revenue at a 13% CAGR from 2013 to 2019 but EPS expanded at only a 3% CAGR.
  As another example of milestones not achieved by CHEF mgmt, they guided to being close to break-even in Texas by 2020 on their 3Q19 call.  One quarter later on the 4Q19 call, mgmt stated they hoped to be break-even in 2021 or maybe not until 2022.  CHEF mgmt proved incapable of delivering on its profit targets during a roaring economy with the tailwind of independent restaurant openings in large cities.  As such, I doubt mgmt can execute well in the current environment where tailwinds have quickly reversed into headwinds.  
  Whether they execute or not, CHEF’s founding brothers, who act as Chairman/CEO and Vice Chairman, will likely continue to be compensated well.  In addition to combined annual salaries > $1.4mm, CHEF pays the brothers > $500k per year to lease an owned warehouse and CHEF covers > $100k of annual costs for a private jet.
  ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE IMPLIES > 65% DOWNSIDE
Applying a generous 20x (SYY’s historical multiple) to my 2022 EPS estimate of ~$0.30 implies CHEF is worth < $7 per share implying > 65% downside.  Lower profits coupled with restaurants likely delaying supplier payments should lead to CHEF burning cash this year and next.  But for conservatism, I assume interest expense is flat over the next few years.  The fair value above also does not account for the time value of money.  Applying an appropriate discount rate of 10% then implies CHEF should be trading for ~$5 per share implying ~75% downside.

    A material turnaround is underway and the market value has yet to catch up with the improvements.  Fiat Chrysler has returned from death’s door to the land of the living, and is now thriving.  The dramatic changes go beyond improvements in margins, cash flow, and the balance sheet to include updated exposures to regional trends in growth markets, a better product mix leaning toward utility vehicles, no further dependence on capital markets, lots of functional enhancements, and positive changes in culture. 
    The tripling of the stock price off the very distressed bottom from ~€5 to mid teens, combined with investor perceptions of macro factors in their home market of Italy, masks what is only the beginning of their return to health.   With trailing revenues of €110B doing €13.5B of EBITDA with Capex of ~€8.5B, and a market cap of €25.8B with ~€6B of net debt, it’s a large global company selling beloved brands of automobiles far beyond its Italian roots.  In addition to Fiat, where 70% is sold outside Italy, Chrysler is a core earnings driver with brands that include Jeep, Dodge, & Ram, plus there are profitable halo brands Alfa Romeo and Maserati.  Overall, the NAFTA region supplied 54% of vehicles sold and 83% of Operating Income in 2017, on par with other major OEMs on whom they appear to be gaining incremental market share.
    Adding to their storied automotive design history is Ferrari (RACE), which has put more than a few racing trophies on their walls over the years, and has done beautifully since it was divested in 2015.  RACE success implies a similar premium multiple could be obtained for the remaining halo brands.  If so, we are creating Jeep/Ram, an $85B company within that generates premium margins, at an extremely low valuation.
    Multiples at FCA are not at all high at a trailing EV/EBITDA of 2.2x, EV/EBIT of 4x, and fwd P/E of 5.3.  Pension liabilities are manageable and don’t materially change these levels.  Guidance in EUR (€) is for €120B Revenues, €8.2B of EBIT and €4.7B of Net Profit.  Free cash flow should be at least €3.5B operationally for each of the next few years with an extra €1-2B of one time working capital squeeze-outs.  This excludes the upcoming spinoff of Magneti Marelli, a company with €5B of Revenues and €0.5B of EBIT, which is entirely gravy.  The spin and ongoing cash flow will bring their already comfortable debt level down to a net cash amount in the near term, and all debt currently trades above par with credit ratings climbing into investment grade zones, now at BB+/positive.
    The turnaround includes a bit of cult of personality around the CEO, Sergio Marchionne, who will be leaving in 2019, after being with the company since 2004. Some investors worry about his departure as if it’s an instant setback, but he’s positioned the firm on solidly profitable footing with trends of improving margins already in place for the following forward outlook:
    Continuing organizational fixes leading to better margins include a de-emphasis of fleet sales, which unfortunately carried low margin, substituted with an improved vehicle mix that includes greater SUV & light truck sales which carry substantial margins. Interest expense is way down to €1.2B this year and will stay below €1B going forward, plus they benefit from lower tax rates.  Other levers to pull include exiting their parts business, and establishing a US captive finance subsidiary. 
    The Finco opportunity could be substantial given they are the only major OEM without one, and such financing provides competitors with 10% to 25% of earnings across the auto landscape.  They are currently deciding whether to buy an existing outfit or build a greenfield start-up, but they expect to fund up to €5B of initial Finco equity from available cash on hand on which they expect a 10%+ pretax yield.  The ample funding will allow an adequate credit rating for the Finco funding to be competitive.  Beyond financial benefits, there are strategic reasons to establish a Finco, not only to incent additional sales, but also to enable participation in emerging TaaS (Transportation as a Service) business lines.
    FCA plans ~€10B of cost savings through 2022 via manufacturing efficiencies and purchasing higher volumes across a reduced number of architectures, leading to a combo of cash build, customer pass through, and reinvestment.

      Investor worries tend to harp on FX headwinds, Pension Liabilities, the CEO departure, and survival scenarios if SAAR of car sales drops to recession levels.  While there is little one can do about FX, the cash flows well underpin their liabilities which are soon to be net cash, and the next CEO may well be chosen from several strong internal candidates running business units.  Tim Kuniskis who ran Dodge/Chrysler and transitioned to Alfa Romeo and Maserati has footprints around the business. Mike Manley has made Jeep a best selling brand, and Reid Bigland increased unit sales 50% as head of US Sales.  Despite Marchionne’s shadow, this is a tight management team and any of the above would be fine leadership choices.
    For downside scenarios, the company stress tests to a down 30% SAAR scenario where it expects to be able to remain operationally free cash positive.  Savings would come from variable labor costs, advertising cost cuts inline with volume declines, and other fixes.  In such a downbeat scenario, EBIT would be down ~€4B, and the €11.5B and growing cash cushion would be helpful if such a situation persisted.  The risk of such a stressed environ becoming real is currently perceived as remote, and I think the valuation and likely growth trajectory provide an interesting risk/reward.
    In a rosier case where EBITDA grows from €13.5B to €15B over the next two years while the company becomes a net cash holder, the implied stock prices are significant increases on the market cap which is currently €25.8B:

  Summary
  Ameresco is a well-managed, owner-operated business that is likely to grow significantly over the next five years.  Ameresco is what is commonly referred to as an “ESCO” (energy service company), founded in 2000 by the current CEO George Sakellaris.  Sakellaris is a key piece of the thesis - he is a pioneer in the industry, owns 50.4% of the company, never sells shares and has added to his stake in the business numerous times. 
  At a high level, Ameresco can be broken down into two main segments: services and owned assets.  Please note that in this report, we use adjusted numbers to estimate the financials of each segment, though the company reports in a different manner – we are happy to go into that detail in the Q&A.  A concerted effort to expand the company’s ownership of small-scale, renewable energy assets during the last five years has resulted in this business becoming a material proportion of the total value of the company. 
  We expect the company to triple EBITDA from company-owned assets during the next five years.  Combined with a modestly growing services business, an equity owner ought to be able to achieve returns approaching 20% compounded during the period.  Given the substantial visibility in the services business from the company’s growing, higher-margin backlog and the long-term contracted nature of the owned assets, the return offered by Ameresco is particularly attractive on a risk-adjusted basis, and we believe it can continue to compound at attractive returns beyond the next five years. 
  Summary Return Potential
  Ameresco’s backlog of existing projects, owned asset pipeline, continued growth of the owned asset pipeline, and modest earnings growth in the company’s services business combine to provide attractive returns over a multi-year period. 
  By 2023 we estimate that nearly 2/3 of the company’s value will reside in its owned asset portfolio.  As previously mentioned, base case returns approaching 20% appear attractive in relation to the predictability of the business:
    Why Does Opportunity Exist?
  While Ameresco is by no means a micro-cap, the high insider ownership limits the float to approximately $280 million.  There is limited analyst coverage and conference calls are usually brief. 
Ameresco doesn’t screen as immediately cheap.  On a P/E, P/B or EV/EBITDA basis, the company doesn’t immediately stand out.  The shares have also tripled from the 2016 lows.  It takes a deeper appreciation of the ongoing business transition (from pure energy efficiency contractor toward owning significant producing assets) and of the meaningful growth in pipeline assets yet to be delivered. 
It is easy to take a cursory glance at the business and assume that the company is highly levered to federal energy policy that, in the current climate, may be a poor place to be exposed.  And while Ameresco does have exposure to tax and regulatory policies at the national level, its exposures are more nuanced.  In particular, the company is highly exposed to state policies that, while a risk, appear quite supportive.
The accounting at Ameresco, admittedly, is complex.  The cash flow statement looks awful on the surface, and it is easy to take a quick pass on that basis alone.  On top of the accounting peculiarities, given the nature of the services business, earnings from quarter to quarter can be quite lumpy.  There are valid reasons for this complexity and the company has not raised equity capital since its 2010 IPO.  
    Management and Incentives
  Ameresco is led by founder and majority shareholder, George Sakellaris.  Sakellaris is 71 years old and founded the company in 2000.  He immigrated to the United States from Greece to attend college and ultimately built a distinguished career in the energy efficiency management space.  Sakellaris owns 50.4% of the equity, and, by virtue of super-voting B shares, controls 80.4% of the vote. 
Sakellaris began his career at New England Electric Corporation (“NEEC”) and in 1979 convinced the utility to launch an energy efficiency consulting business named NEES Energy.  He later pioneered the use of the energy savings performance contract (“ESPC”) model and bought NEES from NEEC in 1990.  Sakellaris renamed the company Noresco and built the company for several years before selling to Equitable Resources in 1997 for $77 million.  Noresco was later bought by United Technologies and remains a competitor today.  In 2000, he founded Ameresco.  The company made a number of acquisitions over the years, including several efficiency subsidiaries of major utilities at, reportedly, attractive prices.  Sakellaris has been instrumental in the development of two of the top energy efficiency firms in the industry.
Sakellaris was compensated with a $733,000 base salary and earned total compensation of approximately $1.17 million in 2018.  His equity stake of approximately $336 million at recent prices is 458 times his most recent base salary and 287 times his most recent total compensation.  Sakellaris is well-incentivized to focus on the long-term, per share equity value of the company.
We believe Sakellaris would be open to a sale of the business at the right price and, in the absence of a transaction, will continue to take steps to maximize shareholder value.  A few years ago, the company investigated the creation of a yield-co for the company-owned assets when favorable market conditions existed, and he previously sold a business in this very industry.  In an interview shortly after the company’s IPO, Sakellaris told a Forbes reporter that he kept voting control of the company to be able to negotiate the best possible price in case the company is sold. 
Sakellaris and the remainder of the team are incentivized on a variety of well-defined metrics versus targets.  Metrics include revenue, EBITDA, new contracts and new awards by business line, SG&A expenses, and growth.  The team is also incentivized on achieving total EBITDA above certain thresholds to an unlimited degree.  The thoroughness and specificity of the targets is laudable, though one might take issue with the significance of EBITDA in a business that is rapidly becoming more dependent on the efficient deployment of capital into owned assets.  Management, nonetheless, appears focused on making rational decisions in the asset business despite the reliance on EBITDA.
We utilized Tegus to speak with a former VP at Ameresco, who said the following about Sakellaris: “I guess the first thing I'll say is the CEO was, not only founded the companies, kind of almost founded of the industry. Just conceptually, I believe he was one of the first people to identify this potential with ESPC. And that is a business that he loves and wants to do as much of that as possible. I don't know what his current age is, 72 or 73. And I expect him to, my expectation is he is going to stay in that position for quite a while. He's very healthy, he's very mentally quick. Great with numbers, good financial mind.”
    Business Overview
  From a high level, Ameresco owns two different business, a services business and an owned assets business. 
  In the services business, a client, like a university or DoD defense base, will solicit proposals seeking to reduce energy consumption and build redundancy into their energy network.  Ameresco will conduct audits, propose a series of improvements and guarantee certain performance outcomes.  If successful in its bid, Ameresco will implement the solution and, in some cases, provide long-term oversight, repairs and maintenance via the company’s operating and maintenance (“O&M”) business.  The investment in the efficiency project is financed either by the client with the assistance of Ameresco (in the case of non-federal clients) or by Ameresco selling its rights to payments from a federal entity to third parites (in the case of federal clients).
  In the owned assets business, Ameresco seeks small-scale energy projects in solar and “green gas” (low carbon natural gas) to develop for its own balance sheet.  It must finance a project, design a solution and find a third party offtake customer for the energy production, while assuring itself an appropriate return on its equity.
  Services Business Details
  The services business has two components: an energy efficiency business and an operating and maintenance (“O&M”) business.
Ameresco’s energy efficiency business helps clients overhaul major building systems, including heating, ventilation, cooling and lighting.  Lighting, heating, and cooling represent approximately 50% of the addressable market.  Measures taken include water reclamation, installing LED lighting, smart metering, micro-grid and storage implementations, combined heat and power development, and installation of renewable energy production.
Ameresco also operates a business that provides operation and management services (“O&M”) to client projects under multi-year contracts.  These services are often associated with projects the company has completed in its energy efficiency business.  While Ameresco now discloses an O&M backlog, it does not segment these results.  In this report, the O&M business is included within the services business.
Competition in the company’s energy efficiency business is material.  The top five or six players represent approximately 50% of the industry, and there is a long-tail of perhaps 100 smaller players.  There are some modest barriers to entry to large ESPC contracts given the qualifications contractors must achieve and the financial investment required to continually bid and quote projects with varying odds of success on a per project basis.  Depending on the year, Ameresco is either the number one or two player in the industry and distinguishes itself from the other large players given its independence from any equipment manufacturer.  On the other hand, those manufacturers have large installed bases that, in certain circumstances, provide an advantage.  At approximately an 8.5% EBITDA margin (and modest D&A), margins are reflective of the competition.  Much to the company’s benefit, Ameresco is seeing the emergence of contracts requiring more integrated solutions that require deeper engineering expertise.  This may lead to further industry concentration and higher margins.

  The market for energy efficiency is more than $7 billion annually and has been growing for several years.  The potential for a long runway seems to exist.  The charts below illustrate some of the historical progression of the industry.  More recently, growth has slowed and industry revenues are likely flat during the last few years, but energy efficiency projects remain one of the cheapest forms of energy production, and Navigant Research sees the market compounding at about 7% through 2024.  In a landmark report in 2009, McKinsey estimated an incremental $50 billion of spending per year for ten years (25% of which would be in Ameresco’s commercial end market) would be required to close the gap on an estimated $1.2 trillion in savings that could be had in the United States from energy efficiency alone.

      Backlog progress in the services business during the last three and a half years has been promising.  Below is a chart of “fully-contracted backlog” (where the progress is more pronounced) and “awarded backlog” (where the progress is more muted).  Fully contracted backlog has grown at an average of 22% annually since the start of 2016.  Disclosures on backlog duration (12 month versus post 12 month) suggest some extension of the duration of the fully contracted backlog over this period.  Also below is the recently disclosed backlog progress in the company’s O&M business.  While it has shown modest growth year-over-year, the backlog has declined marginally each of the last few quarters.  The company is confident that this is the underlying lumpiness and timing associated with adding to the backlog, as opposed to a worrying trend.

  Ameresco is optimistic about margin growth as a result of the improving quality of the services backlog.  It appears the market is moving toward, and Ameresco is capturing, more technical, engineering intensive solutions at higher margins.  Here is a selection of recent quotes:
    “Importantly, we are seeing an increase in gross margins embedded in our backlog as lower-margin contracts progress and are replaced with higher-margin contracts. We believe the increasing complexity of both government and institutional projects will continue to lead to not only larger but higher-margin awards.”
  - 2019 Q2 Conference Call
       “Importantly, our anticipated gross margin on the backlog is about 1 percentage point higher than a year ago driven by large and more complex projects.”
  - 2019 Q1 Conference Call
      A 1% increase in margin would raise EBITDA (and EBIT) at the unit level by approximately 12%.
    Owned Assets Business Details
  In the owned asset business, Ameresco is primarily a developer of new projects and it participates in two distinct markets: solar and green gas (mostly landfill natural gas).  A diagram of the relevant competition in each field is below (solar left, green gas right).  In the solar development business there are many small developers beyond these top players.  Competition for projects is generally intense, and the barriers to entry at the local level are minimal.  On the other hand, the company's green gas projects face much less competition, and industry dynamics provide some barriers to entry.  In landfill gas, for example, the company typically works with a landfill which faces significant liability issues from poor project development (puncturing landfill caps for instance).  Given the small incremental economics for the landfill operator and the higher degree of custom engineering on a project (relative to solar), landfills work with a small number of proven firms.  Ameresco is one of those developers and its reputation in the niche is quite strong.  Returns to equity in this business are, as a result, more attractive.

  The market in which Ameresco participates through appears set to grow for an extended period of time.  The US Energy Administration sees generation capacity growing meaningfully, particularly for solar over the next several years. 
      Source: US Energy Administration
  Owned assets, both operating and in the pipeline, have grown meaningfully, as the charts below suggest.  Pipeline, as used in this report, reflects assets that are either under construction or in development with at least a 90% probability of completion.  Operating assets have risen from 164 MW at the end of 2016 to 250 MW at the end of Q2 2019.  The pipeline during that period has risen almost 3x from 99 MW to 258 MW.  Most of the growth has been from adding solar assets, though several potential additions to the pipeline in the green gas market are being discussed by the company and were again highlighted on the Q2 2019 conference call.  As a percentage of pre-corporate EBITDA, owned asset EBITDA exceeded 50% in 2018.  In 2019 this has continued and may approach 60% for the full year.
      “We have a good pipeline of green gas projects, both in our reported assets in development metric as well as the 5 to 6 earlier-stage projects we have spoken about in previous calls.”
  - Q2 2019 Conference Call
  To an extent, the owned asset business may benefit from the association with Ameresco’s services business.  The strong relationships the company maintains with local municipalities and federal agencies serves them well when contemplating asset development opportunities.  However, there appears to be less overlap between the segments offers than might first be assumed.
When Ameresco is developing an asset, the company typically signs a power purchase agreement (“PPA”) with an offtake party.  These deals are typically 20 years with high credit worthy counterparties like local utilities, providing substantial visibility into future revenues
The economics of Ameresco’s owned assets have improved as the business has scaled in recent years.The following table, based on various company disclosures, highlights an estimated 2018 ROE in the owned assets business of 10.6%.  This is inclusive of a considerable pipeline of projects under construction, but non-producing at that point in time.
  In addition to the overall estimates above, we analyzed the unit economics of individual projects and find them to be attractive as well.   Work suggests that at current investment levels of approximately $200,000 per MW in solar and $1 million per MW in green gas that the company is earning adequate unit-level economics.  On a levered basis, in solar, returns to equity appear to be around 13% and in green gas returns to equity appear to be in excess of 20% (though as noted elsewhere in this report are subject to incremental price risk).  The returns to Ameresco’s equity in the solar business appear to be superior to other developers in the industry.  Research suggests that Ameresco’s deep relationships with local municipalities and building owners, along with a willingness to invest in incrementally more technical projects, account for the attractive returns. 
Ameresco’s debt is, primarily, associated with the company’s owned assets and, in the case of owned assets, is non-recourse (in all but a few immaterial cases).  Leverage, including all operating and development debt, was 3.1x TTM EBITDA in that portion of the business as of Q2 2019.  71% of all Ameresco debt is associated with these projects.  Ameresco also has approximately $83 million of corporate debt as of Q2 2019, which is slightly elevated on account of funding a recent working capital build.  While there is considerable noise quarter to quarter based on working capital, net debt is typically about 1x EBITDA inside the services business.
      Taxes and Incentives
  There are three tax and funding regimes that must be considered when evaluating Ameresco: Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs”) granted to qualifying renewable energy production, Tax Equity Financing (“TEF”), and §179D of the tax code.  A full discussion of each can be found in the Appendix.  The most consequential of these considerations is RINs, which are granted to qualifying producers of various energy sources to incentivize supply.  In particular, the specific credits Ameresco is eligible to receive drive a substantial portion of the economics of the company’s green gas owned assets.  TEF is one of a number of funding mechanisms available to developers of green energy projects that is being sunsetted over the next several years and  §179D is a federal tax incentive that was historically available to Ameresco but has not been renewed.
    Accounting
  Variable interest entities (“VIEs”) are a consideration when studying Ameresco.  At the end of 2018, approximately $123 million of the company’s $460 million owned energy assets were held in VIEs.  These VIEs consist of four investment funds whose structure allows Ameresco to raise third party equity from investors who are seeking particular tax benefits.  These VIEs are consolidated on Ameresco’s financials as it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. 
The accounting for federal ESPC contracts is distracting when examining Ameresco’s cash flow statement.  Ameresco financial statements include “Federal ESPC Receivables” and “Federal ESPC Liabilities.”  Details can be found in the company’s 10-K, but, in effect, expenditures on these contracts flow through operating cash flows while proceeds flow through financing cash flows.  This is because the receivables under these contracts are effectively sold to third-party investors and don’t qualify for sales accounting. 
    Projections, Valuation and Potential Return
  Meaningful upside for Ameresco is dependent on the company growing and delivering on its current pipeline of owned assets during the next five years.  Below is a chart showing the potential growth in EBITDA during the next few years given the pipeline size, mix, and anticipated economics as of year-end 2018 without any further pipeline additions.  On that build-out alone, owned asset EBITDA has the potential to double during the next few years.
One must, of course, also consider the potential additions to the pipeline over the next few years.  In H1 2019, for instance, Ameresco added 101 net MW to its portfolio (operating and developing).  At the end of 2018 the portfolio contained 407 MW.  While it will be lumpy, we expect Ameresco will meaningfully add to its portfolio over the next five years:
Combining projections of the current backlog plus new additions to the pipeline results in meaningful EBITDA growthIt is quite possible that Ameresco more than triples 2018 EBITDA from owned assets by 2023 with meaningful upside beyond that year from the portfolio pipeline that would exist at that time as shown in the “Potential Bar.”
In the services business, assuming modest revenue growth and expansion of pre-corporate margin by 1% during the period, we project the following:

  Combining both sets of projections with modest multiples results in annualized returns approaching 20% compounded from today's share price levels:
      Risks
  While an investment in Ameresco appears attractive, the businesses owned by the company are unlikely to afford one a “lollapalooza-type outcome.”  The company is essentially investing cash flows from a low capital intensity business into long-lived, stable, income-producing power generation assets.  Meaningful surprises to the upside are unlikely.  Additional risks include:
  The departure of Mr. Sakellaris would be a meaningfully negative development.  While 71 years old, he remains heavily involved in the business.
Under an ESPC contract, the engineering firm is responsible for guaranteeing a level of energy savings performance.  This historically hasn’t resulted in meaningful losses and projects are designed with a significant margin of safety.
Additions to backlog in the services business are lumpy and subject to timing issues.  New contracts and awards in the first half of 2019, for example, were down on average 31%.  The company has reiterated that the second half should compensate for that performance simply because of timing. 
RIN D3 pricing is a primary risk.  The chart below shows recent D3 pricing (top blue line) which has declined meaningfully in 2019.  This appears due to the 2019 Renewable Volume Obligations that are in the process of being decided.  For a variety of technical reasons, the volume obligations instituted this year will last for three years.  Some experts we have spoken to believe current pricing is not reflective of underlying supply and demand and that future D3 pricing should improve. It is difficult to tell how much owned asset EBITDA is associated with RIN D3 pricing, as just a portion of the gas portfolio is levered to this particular credit.  Approximately 10%, or 25 MW, is levered to the D3 pricing, but Ameresco does engage in some amount of hedging or forward sales in the business for periods that extend beyond a year.  A reasonable estimate of the owned asset EBITDA contribution from these projects, based on the higher profitability of the projects, might be 35%. 
    Source: Environmental Protection Agency
  The owned asset business is subject to underwriting risk as the company continues to deploy capital into new projects. 
The sun-setting of Tax Equity Financing incentives appears to be bringing forward demand.  There is a risk that as these incentives decline, the could face a demand cliff.  Most experts in the industry suggest this isn’t as dire as would be perceived.  In the solar market for instance, panel pricing is on a continual decline which should continue for the next several years.  Further, historically, the burdens and excesses of the industry have been shared throughout the value chain and have not fallen on just one function within the chain (like the developer in Ameresco’s case). 
    Source: UBS
  Federal renewable energy policy is a risk.  Many would describe the current administration’s policies as potentially hostile toward the interest of a renewable energy developer.  Ameresco is levered to tax and incentive policies to varying degrees across its businesses.  It is also subject to energy efficiency priorities at the federal level in its services business.  While in certain respects we take comfort knowing Ameresco is aligned with certain politically sensitive constituents in, for example, the green gas business, these policies can be unpredictable.  We also take comfort in the fact that state renewable energy policies are a bigger driver of outcomes in many circumstances. 
State renewable energy policies also present a level of risk.  States mandate renewable portfolio standards (“RPS”) and, currently, 29 states and DC have such standards.  These standards target levels of renewable power generation and push demand for renewable projects, including the small-scale projects in Ameresco’s portfolio.  These standards are reviewed every several years and the renewal patters, at times, change demand.

  - Former VP Ameresco
  “… a Johnson Controls is my competitor I'm going to say, ""Listen, all those employees over there are driven to make sure that they put in York International equipment, owned by Johnson Controls. Of course, Johnson Controls is known for Johnson Controls control system. So they're surely not going to want to put in a Siemens or a Honeywell, and what we're going to do as Ameresco is we're going to give you the best fit and function of your building whether that be a Siemens system or a Honeywell system or a Train system or a JCI system, and we're going to put in the most energy efficient component for you that we can… So could that be an advantage for a particular client? Yes, it could. Would I find that to be a complete knock out across the space? No, absolutely not. Because most of the time the customer if they've got a 25 year old carrier unit and it's not working and they need air, their guideline is, get the air conditioning The opposite side if you work at Train or if you work at Johnson Controls is, listen, we have the most energy efficient equipment in the industry, our advantage is we engineer it, we manufacture it, we build it, and we have local branch businesses that can support it after the ESPC work is done. When I put in my train control systems again we engineer the control system, we manufacture it, we have people locally that know how to install it, it's our own Train people that do the installation. And by the way we're here for the next 18 years to maintain that control system for you, can Ameresco do that?” 
  - Former VP and GM Johnson Controls 
  “So if Johnson Controls already has the existing relationship at the university or at the local government level and it has their products and services in there, the batting average if the customer pursues the project is usually above a 75% close ratio”
  - Former VP and GM Johnson Controls 
  “I would say sitting at Train and then also sitting at Johnson Controls they were viewed as a good competitor. If you saw Ameresco being one of the bidders you respected the fact that they were going to look at the project very professionally and that they would put their best foot forward and be a formidable competitor. So it was not like who are these guys? And quite honestly a lot of the people that work at an Ameresco were ex Honeywell or ex Johnson Controls people.”

  Quotes from Tegus Calls - Owned Assets 
  “Our work is primarily driven by state incentives… each market's unique… And so because we're driven by incentive markets that develop finite capacities for development, we're constantly dealing with a rollercoaster of tracking policy, helping craft policy, to be able to implement the type of projects we want, and typically that's a commercial-scale project on a piece of land, like a farm field, forest, or a very large roof.” 
  - Former Senior Manager Solar Development at Ameresco
  “Ameresco has impressive in-house talent. And I've seen that pretty clearly in the other developers I've worked with… Ameresco, they're almost unique in the industry in that they do want to own and operate assets that they develop. While they don't have a large risk appetite to spend cash at risk, they have incredible in-house resources… The difference at Ameresco was that they had such strong depth in engineering, construction management, and legal counsel that they were able to design projects that molded better or fit better to the program, like I've talked a bit about landfills and carports in Massachusetts.”

  “I would be concerned, footnote is the reset rules, right? If EPA comes out very aggressive on the D3 requirement, then I don't think I would be very concerned at all. If the reset rules come out, again this is going to dictate what happens through 2022 and those D3 requirements are set too low, then that's the ultimate risk right there.” 
  - VP Alternative Fuels Council 
  “The biggest risk on their renewable side is in the landfill gas, because you can get a lot of variability in about how much gas you're getting just depending on, there's an art and a science to predicting the gas yield out of landfill. But it is a little bit of an art to it. There's also contaminants that you have in landfill gas in some places. There can be a fair amount of variability to that from landfill to landfill.”

  Taxes and Incenives
  Renewable Identification Numbers (“RIN”s) are EPA granted serial numbers attached to qualifying biofuel production units in the United States.  These RINs are freely tradeable and used to incentivize the production of biofuels.  There are several RIN classifications, but for Ameresco the most material RIN is the cellulosic biofuel D3 RIN that attaches to the green gas the company produces in its high BTU landfill natural gas portfolio.  Given the carbon reduction efficiency of high BTU landfill gas, these RINs are the most valuable RIN available, with prices typically several multiples of other RINs like the D6 ethanol credit.  Given the cost of high BTU landfill gas projects, the incentives derived from the pricing of these RINs account for a substantial portion of the economics of such a project.  Each year, the EPA sets Renewable Volume Obligations (“RVOs”) that, when combined with supply dynamics in each of the individual markets that produce RINs, help determine RIN prices.
Tax Equity Financing is a funding mechanism that renewable energy companies utilize to develop projects.  The federal tax incentives granted to qualifying projects can be separated from the underlying project and sold to investors.  Such investors are typically tax-paying corporations and other investors.  There are multiple structures that can be utilized, with the most common being the flip structure and the sale leaseback structure.  Ameresco utilizes both vehicles depending on the particular circumstances.  As depicted in the exhibits below, in the flip structure, a third party tax equity investor is entitled to not only project cash flows, but more importantly the vast majority of all tax benefits.  The US is slowly sun-setting these tax credits toward a 10% credit in 2022.  In the past, these credits have been extended prior to sun-setting, but that appears unlikely at this juncture.  There are various project construction hurdles in each step-down year that must be met to qualify for the then-existing incentives.  It would appear that these timelines and construction hurdles may be bringing forward demand.
  §179D of the tax code provides for federal tax deductions on qualify energy efficiency improvements under government contracts.  Under the pertinent codes, Ameresco qualified for these deductions as a contractor on these federal and state projects.  In commercial end-markets, the tax deductions are available to the firm making the investment as an incentive.  For several years, these incentives have been scheduled to expire, but have been extended or retroactively implemented.  It would appear unlikely that these deductions will be available to Ameresco in 2019 or the near future.

I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

INTRODUCTION

I believe that Kronos Worldwide (KRO) is a short. The thesis is that a fair cycle average EBIT for KRO should be 40% - 50% below what the market is implying today, and there will be multiple potential catalysts over the next 1 - 2 years that can help the market realize this.

As of Jan 29, 2018, KRO has a market cap of $3.3bn, a TEV of $3.4bn, and is majority controlled by the Simmons family. 18.8% of shares outstanding are public float (i.e. $613mm). Average daily trading volume is 2.2% of public float (i.e. $13mm), and 12% of the public float is sold short. On a LTM basis, the Company generated revenue of $1.6bn, EBIT of $258mm, and FCF of $200mm.

KRO was formerly written up as a long idea by yarak775 in November 2010.

COMPANY BACKGROUND

KRO is one of six major global producers of titanium dioxide (“TiO2”), a white inorganic pigment that provides whiteness, brightness, and opacity (i.e. ability to mask something) to everything from paints, plastics (white bottle caps, white yogurt containers), coatings (cars, washing machines), paper, personal care products (toothpaste, face cream), and food products (mayonnaise or frosting). TiO2 pigment accounts for 70% of global pigment sales, and is considered a “quality of life” product for its ubiquitousness in everyday life.

INDUSTRY BACKGROUND

Because TiO2 is ubiquitous in daily life, demand for the pigment is strongly correlated to general macroeconomic conditions. The long-term compounded growth rate of TiO2 consumption is around 3%, in-line with the long-term growth rate of GDP in developed countries.

There are three main groups of players along the supply chain: feedstock ore providers, TiO2 pigment producers, and end consumers. Both the feedstock ore and TiO2 pigment segments of the supply chain are highly consolidated with a handful of players controlling a majority of market share. End consumers are fragmented, numbering in the thousands. 

TiO2 is manufactured using either a chloride-based process or a sulphate-based process. The feedstocks for each manufacturing process are generally not interchangeable. Chloride-based TiO2 pigments account for 80% of global demand, and sulphate-based TiO2 pigments account for the remaining 20%. 

WHAT THE BULLS ARE SAYING

TiO2 prices have risen by 25% over the past year, buoyed by a strong economy and tight TiO2 pigment supply. As a result, market optimism has soared, and KRO’s TEV and market cap have doubled during this period. The bull thesis is anchored by a single belief, that today’s higher TiO2 prices will be the new norm. To give a sense of the market’s optimism, please see the below table, which illustrates that KRO's current valuation implies a belief that cycle average EBIT is 87% greater than the Company's average EBIT over the past 10 years.
   

However, for KRO, a company with no vertical integration for the majority of its production capacity, price is not the sole indicator of profitability. Feedstock ore costs are an equally important piece of the puzzle. Currently, KRO’s gross margins are the highest they have been since the last cyclical peak in 2011, yet no one seems to be talking about why these margins are sustainable over the long-term. 

Research, not just on KRO, but across the industry uniformly hones in on price and demand, with little to no mention of raw material costs. Based on historical precedent, coupled with comments made on earnings calls by KRO’s feedstock suppliers, there are good reasons to believe that KRO’s gross margins will erode as their suppliers also look to benefit from higher TiO2 pigment prices.

WHY WILL GROSS MARGINS REVERT?

75% of KRO’s manufacturing capacity is chloride-based and is not vertically integrated. As a result, KRO relies on Rio Tinto and Iluka, two large global mining companies, for the majority of their supply. This dependence is likely to get even stronger if Tronox, a vertically integrated TiO2 pigment producer and one of the few remaining chloride feedstock providers of scale, successfully merges with Cristal (another TiO2 pigment producer with some feedstock assets). Pro forma for the merger, Tronox will cease to sell feedstock on the open market, and will instead be using all of it internally to produce TiO2 pigment. With a limited pool of viable global suppliers (Rio Tinto, Iluka, and PF Tronox would control 72% of the market), KRO is a price-taker with little bargaining power.
See above chart for reference on the following commentary. Prior to 2012, the feedstock industry was stuck in long-term price contracts that provided artificial stability and terrible economics. As a result, KRO, and other TiO2 pigment manufacturers, were able to capture significant margin improvement when pigment prices rose. Post-2012, the feedstock industry moved off legacy long-term contracts, with KRO now negotiating prices quarterly for the majority of their feedstock supply. The gross margin difference between these two periods has been stark. For the 5-year period leading up to 2012, KRO's average gross margins were 24%. Even in the middle of the recession, with revenues down 13% and average capacity utilization at 75%, the Company was able to maintain gross margins of 11%. Since 2012, KRO has had an average gross margin of 19%, with gross margins dropping to an average of 7% during FY 2013 (86% average utilization) because the Company got squeezed by falling TiO2 prices and rising feedstock costs.

Over the past three quarters, KRO's gross margin has expanded to over 30%, well above their post-2012 average of ~19%. It is my view that these gross margin levels are unlikely to be sustainable. It has taken time for tightness in the TiO2 pigment industry to trickle into the feedstock industry. At the same time, despite the favorable environment, KRO's feedstock suppliers have deliberately moderated the pace of feedstock price increases, because they believe it is a more sustainable strategy than spiking prices for short-term gains. The reality is that there is tightness in the TiO2 feedstock markets, KRO has little bargaining power, and if increases in TiO2 pigment prices prove to be sustainable, I see no rationale for why KRO's suppliers won't also look to benefit by raising their own prices. In fact, both Iluka and Tronox have alluded to not just the possibility, but the need for higher feedstock prices on their recent earnings calls.

Another bullish scenario is that KRO is able to raise prices at or above the rate of any raw material price increase, thereby preserving their gross margins at current elevated levels. I also view this as a highly unlikely outcome. Large paints and coatings manufacturers have already started voicing concerns regarding higher TiO2 pigment prices. Sherwin-Williams on their Q3 2017 earnings call voiced their skepticism that further price increases sought by TiO2 pigment manufacturers would be successful. PPG on their Q3 2017 earnings call went the farthest by warning that further price increases could cause demand destruction similar to what happened in 2011. As a refresher, in 2011, with TiO2 pigment prices rising by nearly 50%, many end customers resorted to thrifting (reformulating products to incorporate less TiO2) or substitution (reformulating products to incorporate cheaper grades of sulphate TiO2, a non-core product for KRO), causing temporary if not permanent demand destruction for the industry. As of Q3 2017, TiO2 pigment prices are only 20% below peak levels in 2011, suggesting that a price ceiling is likely within view if overall industry health is to be maintained.

Over the next 12 - 24 months, I believe slowing growth / stagnation in TiO2 pigment prices, coupled with decreasing gross margins as feedstock suppliers begin increasing prices, will be the catalysts needed for the market to realize that KRO's operational performance in 2017 is not the new cycle average.

WHAT ABOUT OTHER UPSIDE DRIVERS?

If I'm right on gross margins, I don't see threats to my short thesis emerging from other areas. KRO’s manufacturing capacity has maxed out at 555,000 tons since 2014. The Company has publicly stated that small incremental capacity might be unlocked through de-bottlenecking projects, but no meaningful capacity increases can happen without a greenfield / brownfield investment. For reference, the Company has grown capacity by 8% over the last decade, an average of 4,000 tons a year all from debottlenecking. KRO has also been operating at 100% capacity utilization since Q3 2016. Limited room for additional capacity coupled with 100% utilization means that volume growth is not a credible growth driver.

New greenfield / brownfield investments aren’t happening anytime soon either. Facilities take 3 - 5 years to construct, are very costly (~$1.0bn for a reasonably-sized facility), and KRO has publicly stated for multiple years now that until they see less volatility around pricing, and sustainable / high gross margins (my guess is high-20%), they won’t consider doing any expansions. In fact, a new greenfield expansion, by KRO or anyone else in the industry, will decrease TiO2 pigment supply tightness, sending prices lower such that it potentially offsets any gain in volumes.

Operating costs have remained relatively steady over the last decade. Taking into account that KRO recently completed a headcount restructuring in 2015, wringing additional cost efficiencies from OpEx seems unlikely. CapEx, which is comprised of regular maintenance and environmental compliance costs, is a similar story, also offering no obvious room for trimming. 

All this taken together means that there aren't any obvious growth drivers that could offset a price / gross margin decline.

VALUATION & SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

  If history is any guide, operating expenses should be relatively flat over time. CapEx should also be flat, as management has made it clear for a number of years now that they are not interested in new greenfield / brownfield developments. As a result, I’m flexing pricing and gross margins, KRO's two main historical drivers of profitability, to see the range of potential outcomes.

I am using a cycle-average EBIT valuation multiple of 12.6x, the median of the TiO2 peer set since 2009, defined as KRO, TROX, HUN, VNTR, and CC. I’m choosing EBIT over EBITDA because KRO has near-mandatory capex they need to do each year, and D&A should closely approximate capex. As a sanity check, the median TEV / EBIT multiple of publicly traded inorganic chemical companies, a sample set of over 100, is 12.1x. Narrowing down to just U.S. and European publicly traded inorganic chemical companies gives a valuation multiple of 10.3x. The average multiple of the last 5 years for these two sets doesn’t deviate significantly from today. As a result, I think 12.6x is fair, and seems to bake in the premium TiO2 companies should get for operating in an oligopolistic structure. At 12.6x, using cycle-average EBIT of $146mm (see above table for reference), I believe KRO’s fair value TEV is $1.8bn, and fair value market cap is $1.6bn, 48% lower than today’s market cap of $3.3bn.

To sensitize how cycle-average price and gross margins will affect fair value, please see the following chart, which shows KRO's fair value as a premium or discount to current market cap under various pricing and gross margin assumptions:
 

Base Case: Cycle average pricing and gross margins settle at long-term averages. To be conservative average gross margins includes pre-2012, when suppliers were locked into long-term, low-priced contracts
Upside Case: Cycle average pricing settles at long-term average. Gross margin settles at post-2012 averages of 18% - 19%
Downside Case: Cycle average pricing settles near 2011 peaks, and cycle average gross margin ends up significantly higher than historical

The following table lays out an expected value calculation based on the scenarios outlined above:
 

In conclusion, I arrive at an expected fair value for KRO that is 34% below current market cap.

OTHER CATALYSTS

Besides pricing pressure and rising feedstock costs, I believe there are additional events that could act as downward pressure on KRO's market cap:

1) Probably the most important unknown is how the economy will trend over the next two years. KRO is levered to U.S. and Europe, generating over 80% of sales to those two regions. A downturn in either region could negatively impact demand, causing volume and TiO2 pigment price declines. Conversely, for the reasons discussed above, a continuance of current strong economic conditions is unlikely to result in additional price gains or gross margin increases 

2) New chloride-based TiO2 pigment capacity builds are announced by a major Western producer. This new capacity could potentially reverse a favorable supply-demand dynamic for pigment producers

3) China reverses course on environmental policy, allowing low-cost, low-quality TiO2 plants to operate. Such action would offer end customers a significantly cheaper, albeit low-quality, substitute than is currently available in the market, and one which they have turned to before in 2011, amidst sky-rocketing TiO2 pigment prices

4) China brings on more high-quality TiO2 pigment manufacturing facilities in the next few years than anticipated. This new capacity further strains high-quality feedstock supply, sending feedstock prices higher while lowering TiO2 pigment prices

5) End customers, who have already voiced concern regarding current TiO2 prices, find ways to either materially lower their use of TiO2, or substitute cheaper products, potentially causing permanent demand destruction

RISKS

1) Due to low inventories and an inability to implement additional thrifting / substitution methods, end customers are forced to accept ever increasing prices from TiO2 pigment manufacturers. This allows TiO2 pigment manufacturers to increase prices at or above the rate of feedstock cost increases 

2) Significant new chloride-based feedstock ores are discovered and commercialized. This action creates a large feedstock supply surplus, keeping feedstock prices low over the mid-term

3) Feedstock suppliers move back to long-term pricing contracts, preferring to forgo margin on the upside for margin stability on the downside 

WHY THIS OPPORTUNITY EXISTS

To conclude, I have two hypotheses for why this opportunity exists:

1. KRO is a covered by only three research analysts. The Company hasn’t done an earnings call since Q2 2012, and doesn’t do investor presentations. TROX is probably KRO’s closest comp as it is the only other relatively pure-play name in the space. Both TROX and KRO have doubled their stock price over the past year, leading me to believe investors may be assuming that tailwinds benefitting TROX are also applicable to KRO. This would be a false assumption. TROX can supply 100% of its feedstock internally, so higher TiO2 pigment prices for TROX will translate into higher gross margins. 

2. Generally, the same set of wall street research analysts cover both TiO2 pigment producers and their end customers, whereas feedstock suppliers are covered by a different set of research analysts. As a result, research analysts for TiO2 pigment producers are more likely to focus on the demand / price side of the equation because that’s where they have the greatest insight / expertise.
I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise do not hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.
Catalyst
1) TiO2 pigment price increases slow or stagnate over the next 12 - 24 months, signaling a cyclical peak
2) TiO2 feedstock providers begin to raise prices amidst a tight-supply environment, reducing gross margins for KRO
3) U.S. or Europe economy slows / turns in the next 12 - 24 months, decreasing demand, and negatively impacting both volumes and price
4) New TiO2 pigment capacity is announced, alleviating supply tightness, and leading to price pressure in the mid-term
5) End customers reformulate end products amidst a high TiO2 price environment, discovering ways to materially reduce high-quality TiO2 consumption (the majority of KRO's products) through thrifting and substitution",-14.642353949326008,-15.659863308678961,-46.6952413971019,-40.618865928929836,-6.178360031461836,-0.702580204456955,-5.586318374371457,6.9844117206671275

JAKKs Pacific (“JAKK”) is down about 25% in the last 2 weeks and is currently trading at attractive levels; ~4.4x normalised EV/FCF and 2x Total Debt / FCF ( -$135 net debt). Stock got recently crushed after management revised guidance for the year (15% lower revenue estimates for the year) after sales in the beginning of the holiday season were disappointing.
Annual revenues revised to $660 mm from $770 mm estimated earlier
EPS expected to be ~$0.38 vs. $1.37
The significant revision in earning was unexpected by investors. Management didn’t give any indication of lower revenue estimates during its Q3 earnings call despite being questioned by an analyst specifically if the company could maintain revenues for the year.
Drew Crum - Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst: The revenue guidance you kept for 2011 would imply a pretty hefty increase in the fourth quarter, if my math is right – high teens type growth. Was there anything timing related in the third quarter that shifted revenue into the fourth quarter? Or could you explain what you are seeing for the fourth quarter behind the guidance?
Joel Bennett - JAKKS Pacific Inc - EVP, CFO: In general, we [can't time it]. And that's part of the reason why we don't give quarterly guidance, because there is a continuous flow. Sometimes it picks up sometimes it slows down. But what we do is monitor our POS information, rate of sale at retail and basket configurations and such. So we're on track for the year. But as we can't time the quarters, we don't give the quarterly guidance.
This is despite the fact that the company had to generate ~$230 mm in Q4 sales to meet annual revenue estimates ($198 mm in 2010 Q4).  But two months into this call, management revises its Q4 estimate to ~$125 mm claiming disappointing product sales thus far in the holiday season triggering higher mark downs and royalty expenses. 
Despite the poor handling by the management, the Company is fundamentally sound and the stock has good potential to be around $17 to $18 in the next 8 to 12 months. A quick background on the company and the industry before I delve into my thesis.
Company background: JAKKS Pacific is the 3rd largest toy-maker in US.  Mainly operates in two product lines. 1)  Traditional toys and Electronics – includes Dolls, Action Figures, Vehicles etc.;  2) Role Play, Novelty and Seasonal toys – include Role Play products, Halloween costumes, kids furniture and pool toys. Revenues are evenly split between both the product lines. Distribution channel is dominated by sales in store like Walmart, Target and Toys ‘R; Us. JAKKS currently distributes in over 65 countries with about $55 mm in revenues and is focused on expanding international distribution.
Industry: Market size for traditional toys is around $24 bn and has grown at a very slow rate in the last 10 years, mainly due to rapid industry growth in the video gaming and casino gaming industry. Though there are 1000s of toy manufactures, top 5 industry players dominate most of the market. Mattell has the largest market share ($6.2 bln revenues) followed by ($4.2 bln revenues). Though market growth is slow, product life for toys (Barbie doll, superhero characters etc.) are relatively longer than the video gaming industry products, making revenues less volatile.
Brief positive for the stock are:
Strong product pipeline for 2012: Market has been anticipating couple of new products from JAKK including Monsuno (JAKK owned IP expected to debut in spring 2012) and other entertainment tie-ups.
Strong balance sheet: Approx $235 mm (65% of market cap) in cash holdings. $100 mm of convertible unsecured debt (~3 years to maturity). 
Low trading multiples: ~4.4x EV/ normalised pessimistic FCF.
Strong fundamental investor following: In September, Oaktree expressed interest in acquiring the company for $20 per share (+38% to current stock price). The board of JAKK unanimously rejected the offer claiming the bid was inadequate. Excerpts from Q3 call “Our Board believes that this is not the right time to sell the Company and that the execution of the Company's strategic plan, including potentially transformative products planned and already underway, will provide significantly greater value to the Company’s stockholders”. I believe next time around the BOD would consider any such offers more seriously.
Acquisitions: with strong cash balance and low trading industry multiples, JAKK could find cheap targets to acquire and growth its product pipeline
There are couple of considerations to the price target:
Low consumer spending due to the ongoing economic uncertainty
Pipeline products are not successful as expected
Low insider holding: CEO and CFO hold negligible amount of the Company’s stock.
Dilution from convertible bond: Bond has a conversion price $15.64 (with 3 years life) beyond which it will be dilutive to the company. This is not a major concern to the company has it can always tender the bonds at the right time with available cash or refinancing with new debt at current low interest rates.

I believe EA today presents investors with an opportunity to buy into a well-positioned compounder at a low valuation (around 15x P/E ex cash) that will also see limited headwinds (maybe even tailwinds) from the Coronavirus. As I detail below, I see the video game industry as enjoying 1) LT margin tailwinds from the transition to digital gaming, 2) a very cost efficient entertainment product that should enable strong medium term growth and 3) favorable gamer demographics that will enable longer-term growth. We particularly like EA (see 30%-40% upside to the stock today at 20x P/E adj for cash) as we favor its durable sports franchise with associated growth opportunities.
Why the Video Game Industry is Well Positioned
Gaming industry has gotten notably more profitable and stable for publishers (EA, ATVI, TTWO)
Over the last ~10 years, the videogame publishing industry has seen its profitability improve as the gaming industry has shifted to digital. Today, around 50% of the console gaming unit sales are digital (with the digital mix increasing ~5% per year). By comparison, 90%+ of the PC gaming industry is digital.
The first order benefit of digital gaming is obvious, packaging costs of ~$12 per game go away with digital sales. However, with the rise of digital gaming, we have also seen publishers monetize their games via microtransactions and downloadable content. In both cases, players are able purchase new gaming content and/or features after a game purchase with publishers keeping around 70% of the revenue. Not only are these revenue streams highly profitable but they have also pushed the gaming industry away from the boom/bust cycles of the 2000s to a more stable, compounding sector. 
    Videogames are 1) among the cheapest forms of entertainment that will support continued sector growth in the near-to-medium term and 2) enjoy favorable demographics trends as we are seeing the average gaming get older.
Console/PC games are a fairly inexpensive form of entertainment per hour. The cost of entertainment is most comparable to OTT video. 
    As a result of gaming’s cheap entertainment value per hour, we have seen an increase in consumer time playing video games. The rate of revenue increase for video games has come just under OTT video. 


While the below chart is a bit dated, it shows that has been also been a trend toward gamers being older. This is likely as a result of the rise of Nintendo in the late 80s (which created a first generation of gamers). This further implies more near-term upside to gaming growth if the “Nintendo generation” of gamers keeps player (and older, non-gaming generations are replaced with younger gamers). This trend will be discussed more below.
Over the long run, the rotation to cloud-based gaming looks poised to support longer-term sector growth with additional potential for margin expansion
Over the next 5-10 years, the future of gaming is likely on the cloud. Cloud-based gaming effectively just replaces the console with a cloud server. Today, cloud based gaming is small. For example, Sony offers PS Now which only had ~700k subscribers in March 2019. The services are still small because no one offers a seamless cloud service yet. However, the likes of Microsoft and Google are working to leverage their cloud platforms to develop this technology. The question is more likely when rather than if. 
When cloud-based gaming becomes mainstream, it will likely significantly reduce the barrier to trial for the consumer (after all, he/she will no longer need to spend the $400 required to buy a console). With the below analysis is highly illustrative, if we think that 1) cloud gaming increases gamer penetration in the 5-9 age cohort from 60% to 80% and 2) those new gamers are 75% as sticky through their life as current gamers, it’s easy to underwrite ~4% gaming growth for decades to come.  
Final note is that cloud gaming is also likely to be benefit to MTX take-rates for the publishers. More platform competition means there will be fighting over quality AAA content. While the savings are difficult to exactly quantify, we can look to the PC space where new entrants are undercutting incumbents on tax rates down to as low as 12-15%.
Barriers to entry in the gaming space are increasing as AAA games are increasingly in favor
Gamers are increasingly playing the same games for a longer period of time that has dramatically increased game development costs as publishers 1) try to attract gamers to purchase their titles for longer game play and 2) develop add on products/features for future purchase.
Budgets for flagship games can now exceed $100mm (Destiny and GTA5). This was further echoed by Ubisoft’s CEO who explicitly has said the usual cost of developing AAA game is over $90mm. 
As a result of these high development costs, we have seen the market share of each of the major publisher’s flagship games increase (crowding out other smaller studios). 



Game concentration with a select few publisher incumbents helps to prevent the industry from being invaded in a way that Netflix did to the TV networks. Disrupters in gaming cannot access compelling content because the publishers simply won’t license to them if the economics are not compelling. It also helps that all of the big three gaming companies are also extremely profitable with net cash positions.
Gaming industry appears to be a (relative) Coronavirus winner again supported by its cheap entertainment price and convenience compared to alternatives. 
Recent indications are that the Coronavirus has been a positive for videogame usage. Twitch hours were up 66% in Italy and Verizon CEO noted that internet traffic related to gaming was up 75%. Steam has also seen a marked pick up in hours of gameplay since the world went into quarantine.  
This year was shaping up to be a very quiet year in the gaming industry as publishers waited until the new Xbox and Play Station were released in late 2020 before releasing new games. Thus, if there had to be a year when the Coronavirus would shut down the global economy, 2020 isn’t a terrible year for the gaming industry. Finally, while I’m not sure I subscribe to the view that gaming stocks need to outperform upon the release of new game consoles (particularly now with the new consoles supporting legacy games), the stocks have historically at least modestly outperformed the NASDAQ in these time periods. 


Electric Arts (“EA”) Overview
EA is a $24bn TEV video game publisher and the second largest US video game company behind Activision Blizzard. They are predominantly a Console/PC business (~85% of revenue) and Sporting Games (FIFA/Madden) make up the majority of the business’s revenue.
  EA revenue has historically grown at a MSD rate (a bit below industry average rates likely from EA’s focus on more stable sports platforms- more detail below). EPS/margins for the business have compounded up as the industry structure as improved as discussed above.  
Why I favor EA’s position in the Video Game Space
Sport franchise gaming has the highest moat in the space
FIFA (~45% of EA revenue)’s dispersed contracts makes competition from rival gaming companies almost impossible
In creating FIFA, EA has a wide set of agreements that includes over 400 licensing agreements each negotiated independently and expiring at different times. EA’s near universal coverage of larger leagues gives them a nearly impenetrable moat as soccer fans care most about playing with their favorite clubs. Rival publishers simply cannot amass a comparable number of leagues. For example, notable rival PES doesn’t have even close to FIFA’s team roster (likely due to individual club exclusivity agreements) and sells a modest sliver of FIFAs ~20mm in unit sales. 
  Madden (~10% of EA revenue) has over 16 years as the only mainstream football game in the market with incumbency only further entrenched with the proliferation of multiplayer mode
Videogame publishers negotiate a contract with the league/players association once every 7 years for US sports (NBA, NFL). The contract that EA has with the NFL is exclusive (and has been since 2005). While there is some risk of a deep pocked bidder coming in and stealing the NFL licensing rights from EA, the complications around creating a AAA sports game makes this an incredibly hard feat. EA developers have spent decades getting the exact details of each NFL player (along with the sports stadiums, commentators, etc) right. We have directly seen just how big the incumbency moat is with the NBA (which has similar concentrated, exclusive licensing rights). EA tried to re-enter the NBA franchise with NBA Elite 2011, but it flopped against the incumbent NBA 2K (which outsells it 20:1). Moreover, incumbency positions have likely only become more entrenched with the expansion of multiplayer/live services. 
While there is some concern over the recent NFL contract renewal for EA, I see little reason to worry. There has literally not been a rival NFL game launched in over 16 years. Additionally, TTWO recently renewed its NBA2K contract with the NBA whereby it said it didn’t expect margins to be meaningfully impacted (and here, there is an active competitor in EA’s NBA Live)
Live Service Revenue has been a tailwind for years driven by Ultimate Team. Ultimate Team revenue (estimated to be half of live services revenue) looks set to keep growing. 
As shown below, EA live service revenue has grown at around 20% per year for almost a decade. Ultimate Teams, a multi-player game mode on FIFA/Madden where players can purchase packs of characters to use in-game, has been a huge component of that growth. 

While Company disclosure around components of live service revenue isn’t great, we know that in 3Q’20, Ultimate Team Live Service Revenue was up double digits while FIFA Ultimate Team Matches were up 40% in 3Q’20. Madden/FIFA Ulitmate Team players were also up 20%/22% YoY in 2Q’20.  On the 3Q’20 earnings call, the EA CFO noted that its not ARPU increases that are driving Ultimate Team growth; rather, it is user engagement. 
“Team, really has benefited from more people and more engagement versus, once again, trying to change the ARPU in some fashion. We're very conscious about not trying to get people to spend beyond what their spend levels are. And so the best way to get people is to -- get people to spend in that is to engage them in better and more events that they'reexcited in.” EA CFO on 3Q’20 Earnings Call
  I believe this sets Ultimate Teams up very well to grow given the large improvement in user experience that will come with new game console launches at the endof this year. As you can see from the specs below, computing rates in the new consoles are twice as good along with big improvements to memory/display.
Gaming Portfolio is resilient with optionality for business to surprise on new releases
EA expects revenue and EPS growth in FY2021 (even as game launches are light ahead of new console launches) with growth than accelerating in 2022 as new games (Battlefield) are launched. In part, this likely again speaks to the positive trends around live service/Ultimate Team revenue. However, it also supports my belief that the EA ex-sports franchises aren’t terrible. 
Many people would probably rate the ex-sports EA portfolio as “B-” at best. However, the Company does have some other reliable cash cows such as Sims. Sims business generates $300-$400mm of revenue and has grown basically every year since launch. The Star Wars franchise (which has seen more misses than hits) also still does generate good revenue for the company with its latest launch (Last Jedi) poised to sell at least 6mm copies this year. 
While the below chart isn’t exactly apples to apples (ATVI for example capitalizes some of its R&D), the basic message is EA does spend a ton of money on R&D. While product cycles can definitely surprise to the downside (Battlefield V in 2019), what you don’t know about in a publisher’s portfolio is normally your friend. For example, Apex legends basically showed up out of the blue and now generates $300-$400mm of revenue for EA (with further monetization likely).


Valuation
Company looks poised to sustainably generate a 14% TSR compared to its ~10% WACC (implying 40% upside to the stock)
Recent incremental margins have been around 60% (with 9 year average a bit higher than that). Again, I believe the longer-term trends (more MTX, DLC; more competition among platform operators; higher game moats) will continue to support incrementals in this 60% zip code. As outlined above, I don’t think underwriting 5% annual revenue growth seems crazy in light of longer-term favorable trends in gaming (cloud computing opening up TAM, inherently young population of gamers who will continue to play as they get older, etc). 
Given net income margins today are around 30%, a 5% increase in revenue at 60% incrementals will allow EPS to compound at 8-10% growth rate. The company also will generate around $1.3bn of equity FCF (where I deduct SBC) in FY2020. This is around a 6% FCF yield on the current market cap of EA (after removing cash). Thus, the business generates a sustainable ~14% TSR annually compared to a WACC of around 10%.  Thus, I see around 40% upside to EA today (14% TSR divided by WACC of 10%). 
Another way to look at EA is on P/E. Today, you can buy EA at ~15x P/E (adj for cash) and a modest (~.3x premium to the market multiple) when it has recently averaged a 2-3x premium. If you assume the stock should trade near its 2018 average P/E of 20x, it implies 26% upside to the stock.
    I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise do not hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

Executive Summary
General Motors (""GM,"" the ""Company,"" or ""New GM"") is a leading global automotive manufacturer with operations in over 120 countries.  Including joint ventures in China, the Company sold 8.2 million vehicles over the past twelve months ending 9/30/10 which represents 11.5% of total vehicle sales worldwide.  North America accounted for 32% of sales, Europe accounted for 20%, and the rest of world accounted for 48%.  Of note, GM has the largest market share of all the global OEMs in the fast growing BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China).
The New GM is a much better quality company than the Old GM.  Through the bankruptcy, GM eliminated the majority of its debt (the Company now has net cash and plans to repay outstanding debt over the next 2-3 years) and cut a substantial amount of cost from its business.  For example, in North America GM eliminated approximately $9 billion from its $84 billion cost structure (11% of total) and now breaks even at the bottom of the cycle (10.5-11.0 million SAAR) instead of the middle of the cycle (15.0 million SAAR).  The industry is also much healthier.  During the recession, OEMs around the world reduced capacity significantly which led to improved pricing and more rational competition.
GM is cheap on an absolute basis.  At $36.50, the Company trades at 4.5x 2012 EBIT, 2.7x 2012 EBITDA, and 5.9x 2012 earnings assuming the Chinese JVs trade at a relatively inexpensive 10x earnings.  These multiples are cheap given GM's improved quality and strong cyclical and secular growth prospects.  On the cyclical side, both U.S. and European vehicle SAAR are currently well below replacement demand at 12 and 18 million, respectively, and should rebound to 14 and 20+ million by the end of 2012 as the respective economies continue to recover.  On the secular side, auto penetration in the BRIC countries is still well below the developed markets and should increase as these countries grow wealthier.  Given GM's #1 market share in these countries, it is best positioned to benefit from this secular growth dynamic.
On a relative basis, GM is also cheap.  Ford, its closest peer, trades at 4.7x 2012 EBITDA and 8.2x 2012 earnings.  Assuming GM trades at 4.5x 2012 EBITDA, which is a slight discount to Ford, there is 45% upside from a limit of $36.50.  This seems reasonable given GM's better growth prospects in the BRIC markets.
In summary, GM is an improved company in an improved industry with strong cyclical and secular growth prospects.  This, combined with its cheap valuation, make GM a compelling investment.  Furthermore, downside is limited given you are buying GM at the bottom of the cycle with significant pent-up demand, especially in North America.
Investment Thesis
Cheap valuation.  At $36.50, GM trades at 4.8x 2012 EBIT, 3.1x 2012 EBITDA, 5.3x 2012 earnings, and 0.39x 2012 revenue.  If you back out the Chinese JVs at 10x net income, the multiples fall to 4.5x 2012 EBIT and 2.7x 2012 EBITDA.  A 10x earnings multiple for the JVs is arguably conservative given that the comparable publicly traded Chinese companies trade in the mid-teens.  At this valuation, GM is cheap on an absolute basis given its solid growth prospects driven by the cyclical recovery in North America and Europe and the secular growth opportunity in the BRIC markets, where it is the market share leader.  On a relative basis, GM trades at a significant discount to Ford (4.7x 2012 EBITDA, 8.2x 2012 earnings, 0.49x 2012 revenue), its closest peer, even though its growth prospects are better.  In my view, GM's relative value gap vs. Ford will close as it continues to execute and the overhang from bankruptcy lifts.  In addition to being cheap on a relative basis, GM is in an industry where there is an opportunity for a multiple re-rating.  Overall, the industry trades at similar multiples as it did in the past despite increased stability of earnings due to capacity reductions and cost cuts, and a lower risk profile due to less levered balance sheets and increased revenue diversification.  Due to these improvements, the companies are earning similar profits at the bottom of the cycle as they did at the top of the last cycle.  For example, GM will earn approximately $15 billion of EBITDA in 2010, which is 10% higher than 2007, despite U.S. and European vehicle SAAR being 29% and 20% lower, respectively.  As SAAR continues to recover, there will be a significant opportunity for growth that I believe is underappreciated by investors which should lead to further multiple expansion.
Strong cyclical growth prospects.  Current demand in North America and Europe is well below replacement.  As consumer sentiment improves, demand should continue to rebound back to the normalized level and may even overshoot due to pent-up demand that has built up over the last few years.
Strong secular growth prospects in the BRIC markets.  At 13%, GM has the largest market share in the BRIC markets and is best positioned to benefit from the rapid growth as car penetration increases.  This compares to GM's closest peer Ford, which has a low single digit market share (1.9%).  CSM, the leading automotive market forecaster, projects that production in Asia (excl. Japan and Korea) and South America will be 49% and 36% higher in 2015, respectively, vs. 2010.  This increase will be driven by a rise in car penetration as the BRIC countries grow wealthier.  In my view, there is plenty of upside on top of CSM's forecast.  Sales in the BRIC markets would have to triple to reach the average sales per person in the non-BRIC markets (weighted avg. non-BRIC vehicles sold per 100 people = 2.8, weighted avg. BRIC vehicles sold per 100 people = 0.9).  In addition, the vehicle penetration in the non-BRIC markets is over 10x greater than the vehicle penetration in the BRIC countries (weighted avg. non-BRIC vehicles per person = 0.51, weighted avg. BRIC vehicles per person = 0.05).
Improved cost structure.  During the bankruptcy, GM cut approximately $9 billion of cost from its North American cost structure causing its break-even to improve to 10.5-11.0 million U.S. SAAR from 15.5 million previously.  The largest component of GM's cost savings is labor - from 2007 to present, GM cut its North American labor cost by 55% from $11 billion in 2007 to $5 billion presently.  GM's labor savings were driven by a 36% reduction in its workforce and the elimination of its retiree healthcare obligation.  In addition to these labor cuts, GM reduced production capacity by 40% and its dealer network by 28%.  Outside of North America, cost has been more difficult to cut.  In Europe, GM is in the process of cutting capacity by 20% mainly through the closure of its Antwerp, Belgium plant.  As a result, GM hopes to break-even in Europe next year.
Solid balance sheet.  Through the bankruptcy and IPO, GM was able to reduce its debt from over $50 billion to $11.1 billion comprised of $5.6 billion of debt and $5.5 billion of preferred stock (excludes mandatorily convertible preferred stock).  GM now has $14.2 billion of net cash, which is a stark contrast to the past decade when it ran its business with well over $10 billion of net debt on a regular basis.
Improved pricing.  Global capacity reductions have led to improved pricing throughout the industry.  A main driver of the improved pricing has been lower incentives, especially for GM.  During the last three quarters, incentives for GM have fallen from over $4,000 per vehicle to approximately $3,000 per vehicle.  In addition to lower incentives, over the past 12-18 months, GM increased price by 11% which equates to an additional $8 billion of revenue.  This pricing power will likely grow stronger when GM refreshes approximately 56% of its fleet in 2012 and 2013 while the rest of the industry only refreshes 42%.  Note that fleet refreshes typically lead to increased pricing power and market share.
GM will gain market share in the leasing segment of the auto market due to its recent acquisition of AmeriCredit.  Over the past 12-18 months, GM has lost share in the leasing segment of the auto market due to GMAC's increased focus on prime/non-lease lending.  In 3Q10, leases accounted for approximately 7% of GM's sales vs. the industry at 21%.  To address this market which the Company underserves, GM announced in July 2010 that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire AmeriCredit for $3.5 billion.  In my view, this acquisition should allow GM to gain back its lost market share in the lease segment of the market over the next few quarters.
Investment Concerns
Double dip recession.  During the 2008-2009 recession, U.S. and European vehicle SAAR fell below 10 million and 18 million units, respectively.  GMNA's current break-even is 10.5-11.0 million units and GME's break-even after the closure of its Antwerp, Belgium facility will be approximately 19 million units.  If these recession lows are tested again, both GMNA and GME will lose money.  However, unlike the prior recession, GM has a strong balance sheet with nearly $30 billion of liquidity including its $5 billion undrawn revolver.
Higher oil prices cause the mix to deteriorate.  If oil prices rise, demand for trucks, which are less fuel efficient, will likely decline.  Nearly 65% of GM's production in North America are trucks.  Based on my estimates, the contribution margin of trucks are more than double that of cars.  For every 1% mix shift to cars, GM will lose $136 million of EBIT.  To take this risk into account, I assume the mix will deteriorate to less than 60% by 2012.  Note that the mix bottomed at 55% in 2008 when oil spiked to over $130 per barrel.
Pension overhang.  GM's retirement obligations are underfunded by $32.8 billion.  Note that this includes the $2 billion of cash and $4 billion of stock that GM contributed to its U.S. pension as part of the IPO.  The $32.8 billion gap is comprised of $13.0 billion for the U.S. pension, $10.3 billion for the non-U.S. pension, $5.6 billion for the U.S. OPEB, and $3.8 billion for the non-U.S. OPEB.  GM plans to contribute over $10 billion to its U.S. pension over the next two years and I expect it will be fully funded by the end of 2012.  GM is not required, and has no plans, to fund the OPEB and non-U.S. pension liabilities.  To account for this large liability, I tax effected it at 35% and included it in the enterprise value as debt.
China.  GM's large exposure to China provides the Company with a significant growth opportunity, but is also risky.  The largest China risk is the economy.  Many investors are concerned that it could be overheating and that there is a property bubble.  If this bubble bursts and wealth disappears, demand for autos will decline.  Another China risk is the joint venture structure that GM and other multi-nationals are forced to operate under.  GM's partners could potentially steal its proprietary technology and use it to compete and for their own profit.  In my view, this risk is lower for GM than the industry.  According to many analysts, GM's relationship with its largest partner, SAIC, is the strongest within the auto industry.  Moreover, SAIC recently bought $500 million of GM stock during the IPO to further strengthen its relationship with GM.  The last China risk is the government, which is unpredictable and could intervene to make operating in China far less attractive to GM.
Poor product refresh.  As previously mentioned, GM is in the midst of refreshing its product line-up.  Typically this leads to market share gain and strong pricing power.  However, there is a chance that the new line-up fails to attract interest and leads to market share loss.  The management team is new and GM has not done a major refresh for several years.  Even with a lack of track record, I am optimistic based on management's comments to date.  For example, management has committed to spend $7 billion per year on capex (even during downturns) to maintain and build its brand value.  The Old GM was forced to cut capex to $5.5 billion during the downturn due to liquidity constraints, which delayed product refreshes and led to share loss.
Ownership overhang.  Even after significant sales during the IPO, UST, the Canadian government, and the VEBA still collectively own nearly 50% of the shares outstanding.  These shareholders will likely be sellers over the next 1-2 years, which could be an overhang on the stock.
Is the industry really different?  Over the past 12-18 months, significant production capacity was cut from the industry and balance sheets were solidified.  More importantly, pricing has improved which has led to much better profitability at the bottom of the cycle.  In summary, the evidence to date that the industry is healthier has been positive.  However, I think a healthy amount of skepticism is needed given the industry's past track record.  What will happen if we enter a double dip?  Will the OEMs get more aggressive with price to try to steal share to maintain volumes?  Unless we enter a double dip, we will not know the answer to this question.

Shares out 138.9m FD

A purchase of Grove shares represents a timely and compelling speculation
right now. I believe there is an opportunity to make a very high percentage
return in a relatively short time frame. On a risk adjusted basis, I value the company in excess of $C 1.20 today.

Grove is a well financed development stage company that currently has no revenues and no reserves booked. However, the company has assembled an impressive resource package that, if proved up, could transform the valuation of the company.

Grove believes there is a significant opportunity to arbitrage smaller gas fields in Continental Europe that may be too small for major oil
companies to bother with, but can be quite meaningful for a smaller company.
Junior explorers got a new lease on life when the majors exited the shallow Gulf of Mexico. Oilexco is implementing an analagous strategy in the North Sea and has seen its stock rise substantially.

By pursuing opportunites in Continental Europe, Grove may be doing them one better, in my opinion. Because of the advancements in drilling technology in recent years and the sometimes primitive methods used by eastern european countries historically, Grove has a real chance to create value by applying modern methods to fields that have not been given the proper attention. Grove currently has prospects in Italy, Romania and Slovenia.

The CEO, Glen Whiddon, has put a good chunk of his own cash into the deal and owns over 6 million shares. He has an entrepreneurial background and is complemented by solid technical people.


Property Portfolio

Slovenia

is now a member of the EU (formerly part of Yugoslavia). The gas
field the company is developing is located in a panhandle wedged between
Hungary and Croatia. Recoverable reserves have been pegged by a third party engineering firm at between 150 and 400 BCF. Since gas prices run about $US 5.40 per mcf, and are readily marketable, reserves discovered here would be quite valuable indeed. Grove owns a 45% interest in the field.


The first well ""D-14"" reached total depth in October of this year. Fracing operating are now ongoing. When fracing is completed the wells will be flow tested. Indications are that the fracing is going extremely well. There should be additional information released within days. Plans are underway for a second well already, which indicates management likes what they see so
far.

Valuation:
Taking the low end of the engineer’s report of 150 BCF x 1 euro mcf value x 1.62
Exchange rate to CAD = 243m $C – Capital Cost (15 wells at 2m euros each) $C 49m
= $C 194m x 45% = 87m / 138.9m shares = 63c share x .8 chance of success =
= 50c share

Alternatively one could use the market value of GRV’s junior partner in Slovenia to value Grove’s position. Loon Energy (LEY in Canada) owns a 10.5% interest after an initial accelerated payout.
Loon’s current market cap is almost $C 19m. Since the stock has moved a bit and there are a few assets outside of the Grove deal, let’s call it $C 15m. This market value of Loon implies an EV of the Slovenian field of about $C 142m x 45% = 64m = 46c share

Italy-

San Marco concession, Abbadesse- well spudded in November and should reach total depth within the next week or so. After reaching certain thresholds, the company retains a 94% interest in the well and is obligated to sell the Gas to Blugas, an Italian Gas company. Grove was looking for 80-100 BCF in two zones. While no results have been released, I believe there is a very high degree of excitement with what's been encountered so far. An analyst report has indicated a $1 dollar per share in value to the company should the company find success here.

Grove has identified additional prospects that would be pursued should the current well prove successful.

Valuation: 30% chance of $1 per share = 30c per share



Offshore Sicily -
The company is shooting seismic on this prospect which is located off the island of Pantelleria, located not far from the Tunisian coast. Should seismic confirm potential, I would look for the company to bring in a partner. While a play like this could have home run potential, it’s a bit premature to assign much value to it.


Romania-

While the company only secured the deal recently, drilling is ready
to begin this January. This is a high impact opportunity. Target is 40-50 million bbls of oil, of which Grove's interest would be 30%.
Valuation: 40mm bbls x .3 interest x .3 confidence level x $C 10 bbl = $C 36m

Balance Sheet – Grove has conducted a number of financings in the last year, including the most recent AIM listing in London in early December. The company indicates there should be 20c share left in the kitty after financing the Slovenian and Italian wells currently drilling.

ENDO was presented by omar810 earlier this year. We are resubmitting the idea as we think the thesis has evolved significantly and in addition the stock has fallen over 40% since then. We beleive that ENDO is one of the most undervalued special situations in medical technology that we've seen in a long time.

Basic Thesis
- Institutionally abandoned equity due to accounting issues and former management team – problems almost entirely fixed now
- Clear leader in the fast growing space of curing prostate cancer with cryoablation (freezing of cancer)
- 2Q procedure growth was 22% sequentially and 55% YOY – running at less than 3% penetration of target market
- Cheap stock given the growth rate and earnings potential - Trades at low multiple to future revenues, has very solid gross margins, and will only require minor Capex going forward
- Opportunity to buy Endocare for 1/8 of the price that a large pharma/device company offered to acquire ENDO a few years ago before the accounting problems
- Approaching milestones in 2nd half of 2004 that create clear catalysts for stock price appreciation

Description
Endocare (Ticker: ENDO) is the leading company in the freezing of prostate cancer. Company has ~200 boxes in the field and generates revenue through the sale of disposable cryosurgical probes and through procedure fees for each cryosurgery performed.

Target Market
Last year about 220k thousand men were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Of these about 40k went into ‘watchful waiting’ (no procedure is performed while the progress of the cancer is monitored) and some die before a procedure is performed. Of the remaining patients about 40% (72K) got RP (radical prostatectomy = surgery = removal of the prostate) and 60% (108K) got some form of radiation therapy. It is this population of 180k patients that represent potential candidates for cryosurgery. In 2003 ENDO did 3584 procedures (2.2% penetration) and on a TTM basis they did 4308 procedures (2.4% penetration). Clearly cryosurgery of the prostate has significant growth potential as the benefits over other forms of treatment become understood by more doctors and patients.

Why Cryo? Efficacy
- Comparable efficacy to leading treatments (RP/radiation) with lower side effect profile (see www.endocare.com for complete efficacy data). “In the August 2002 peer-reviewed supplement of the journal Urology results of a seven year study of 590 cryo patients found that 92% of low-risk cancer patients, 89% of moderate-risk patients, and 87% of high-risk patients were disease free.” (Source: Endocare Website)
- Equal efficacy to surgery and radiation in low risk cases and likely better efficacy in high risk cases
- Endorsed by a number of top urologists including leaders at Mayo Clinic and Columbia Presbyterian

Why Cryo? Other Key Benefits
- Cryosurgery can be repeated. This is often not the case with radiation therapy because the body will have received too much radiation. Also, having radiation therapy limits a patient’s ability to employ radiation if needed for another indication further down the line.
- With focused ablation (partial freezing of the prostate) rates of impotency and urinary incontinence are much lower with cryosurgery. This is key since with improved PSA tests men are discovering younger and younger that they have prostate cancer. Quality of life (i.e. potency) is much more important to a younger patient. With older patients, RP related side effects are less of an issue as patients are less likely to be sexually active
- RP is not reversible (can’t put prostate back in!) and thus surgery is a permanent decision. Surgeons tend to have a ‘cut the whole thing out’ mentality. This was similar for a long time in breast cancer where the solution was to remove the breast. It took a long time to break that mentality and for doctors to look to lumpectomy to treat early stage breast cancer. Cryoablation is essentially the male lumpectomy and this thinking is beginning to take hold.
- Cryo is significantly cheaper than surgery
- Cryosurgery is minimally invasive and requires shorter recovery times

Thus, leading doctors are increasingly looking to cryosurgery as a front-line therapy. It can be tried first before needing to subject the patient to radiation or taking the irreversible step of surgery. Also, urologists like cryo because it keep patients within their fold. They do the cryo procedure themselves rather than referring their patient to an interventional radiologist or to surgery. Control over the patient and reimbursement stay with the urologist. (Reimbursement has been established for a number of years with government agencies and private payors. Cryo got its own code at the begging of 2004 - rates in 2005 look to be flat).

Procedure Growth and Trained Doctors

TTM at 2Q Annualized
2002 2003 30-Jun-04 30-Jun-04
Procedures 2,474 3,504 4,308 5,168
Total Trained Docs 275 536 682 n/a
Boxes in the Field 190 203 193 n/a

As seen above, procedure growth has been strong with Q2 2004 procedures running at a rate 55% higher than in Q2 2003. In addition, Endocare has been aggressive about continuing to train doctors (despite the substantial expense). This is essential as there will someday be more competition and ENDO must make sure that docs are trained, qualified, and comfortable on their system.

What the data above does not illustrate is that doctors who’ve been performing the procedure for a few years now do so on a far more regular basis – trained docs grow increasingly comfortable with performing the procedure and with patient outcomes. Thus, even if ENDO stopped training docs (which they have no intention of doing) we could expect to continue to see strong increases in procedure growth. We estimate that by mid 2005 ENDO will be annualizing at 10k procedures per year (represents only 5.6% penetration). This would require about 18.6% sequential growth each quarter for the next four quarters (last four quarters were 16.2%, 15.7%, 10.2%, 21.7%). At the very least we expect procedures to be running at 10k per year by 3Q 2005 (14.6% sequential quarterly growth from 2Q 2004).

Economics of Cryosurgery

For Cryo procedures, hospitals get reimbursement for about $6.5k to $14.0k primarily depending if cryo is done on an inpatient or outpatient basis. Cryo is a very viable outpatient procedure but hospitals still make better money if they do it on an inpatient basis. The hospitals must pay out about $5k related to cryo probes and procedure fees so the procedure is still reasonably profitable for them.

Endocare’s cryo division earns money in a number of ways
1. Of last years 1292 cases we estimate that about 500 were done on ENDO owned boxes. In this case ENDO earns the full $5k. We expect this number to be flat at 500 going forward.
2. For about 200 of the cases ENDO simply sells the probe kits directly to hospitals. We believe this is primarily in cases where kits are being sold to interventional radiologists for other forms of cancer treatment. There also may be some cases where the procedure will not be subject to traditional reimbursement and therefore the hospital buys the kits directly. In these cases ENDO simply charges $2.75k for the probe kits.
3. For the remaining cases, ENDO bills the 5k but the procedure is done on a box that is not owned by ENDO (built by Endocare but owned by a hospital or urology partnership). ENDO passes along $2.25K of the $5k procedure fee to the owner of the box. The net economic effect of this transaction type is the same as item #2 above (same gross profit) but it generates higher revs and a narrower gross margin because there is essentially pass-through income.

Going forward Endocare expects more procedures to be done without using ENDO owned boxes and thus blended gross margins will trend down over time. Having said that, they are in the process of successfully negotiating about $250 more per kit (thus they will get $3.0k per kit) and lowering mfg costs on probes which should mitigate this gross margin trend.

TIMM Medical

Endocare also has a division called TIMM Medical. This division was acquired a number of years back and is not integrated with the cryo business (i.e. separate sales force etc.). TIMM sells pump products for erectile dysfunction (patient population have conditions that Viagra and similar drugs do not work for). TIMM does about $9mm-$10mm per year with about 50% gross margins. We believe that at some point down the line TIMM will be sold to some strategic buyer with a sales force in urology. We would expect 1.0x to 2.0x sales or roughly 2.0x to 4.0x gross margin dollars (sales force could be eliminated so much of gross profit will drop to the operating line of acquiring company). For modeling purposes we have used a transaction price of $15mm less transaction costs of $1.0mm for a net of $14mm. ENDO should have no tax on this transaction since they will be taking a loss on the deal (ENDO also has $50mm in NOLs). (Note that the former management team paid about $37mm in cash and stock for TIMM Medical. Since that time the company has taken a ~$20mm write down on the transaction)

History

Endocare has a long and somewhat sordid history and previous management alienated a lot of investors. The stock fell from $23 at 10/24/01 to a low of $1.06 on 10/16/03 amidst mgt. fraud allegations and an accounting scandal. There is not sufficient time here to replay everything that happened except to say that old management’s accounting/reporting was aggressive and sloppy to say the least. Since this time ENDO has been in the ‘penalty box’ with investors, the SEC, the DOJ, plaintiffs’ attorneys, etc.

Recovery Process / Future Milestones

Relegated to the PINK sheets, ENDO needs to do a number of things to once again become an institutional quality security. These include:

- Settle their outstanding shareholder lawsuit: We predict this is the first thing investors will see. The liability should fall within the bounds of their $20mm D&O policy. ENDO’s insurance companies of course are making things a bit difficult in an attempt keep restitution low. In addition, despite not being liable, ENDO will likely have to pitch in a few million dollars as part of any settlement in order to keep the case from going to court and incurring more costs.
- Settle the SEC investigation: In spring 2004, ENDO finally filed a number of past due SEC filings (10Ks, 10Qs) and now is in compliance with Sarbanes Oxley. The SEC has started the process (Wells notices etc.) of pursuing judgment against ENDO. We suspect that the SEC will fine them $150k (this is the statutory maximum the SEC can charge per restated filings) per infraction for each of their seven cited infractions. Thus, ENDO would owe $1.05mm.
- Settle DOJ investigation: Since 2003 the DOJ has been investigating ENDO in connection with the accounting / reporting issues. The DOJ has not been in touch with ENDO regarding this matter in a while. Apparently they have no clear cut schedule in which they intend to pursue this case. Based on our discussions with management, it appears that the DOJ may be waiting to see how the above two items are resolved. Some past experience would suggest that as long as the former shareholders get some form of compensation, the SEC is satisfied, and former management are no longer involved with the company – then the DOJ is not likely to hit ENDO with any substantial penalties. The DOJ has bigger fish to fry and would be unlikely to do anything that would cripple a company that is in the business of curing cancer and has righted past wrongs.
- Relisting on a major exchange: Endocare has had discussions with both NASDAQ and AMEX both of whom showed interest in listing ENDO once some of the above matters are resolved. At present ENDO does not meet the NASDAQ $4/share listing requirement but does meet the requirements for AMEX listing. It is worth noting that the CEO has told us they’ve had significant interest from a number of money managers who are restricted from investing in Pink Sheet stocks. A relisting would of course allow this demand to come into the market.
- Refinance the balance sheet (discussed in detail below)

We think these milestones will be achieved roughly in the order presented above. From a strategic standpoint it makes more sense to settle the shareholder suit before improving the balance sheet – no sense in entering such negotiations with cash on hand. Also, the major exchanges will want to see progress on the shareholder lawsuit and the SEC investigation (and possibly the DOJ investigation) before considering ENDO for relisting.

Liquidity / Refinance of Balance Sheet

Endocare has about $11mm in cash and is burning cash at about $1mm per month. This rate would be somewhat lower if they were not dealing with trying to resolve all of the above mentioned items. We estimate that in 2003 there were over $12mm in extraordinary cash expenses. This year we think that number will be closer to $6mm. As part of the shareholder lawsuit they also may be expected to contribute some amount toward reaching an out of court settlement. Based on conversations we’ve had with the company and with lawyers we estimate this to be $2mm-$4mm.

The combination of cash burn and the potential need for money for a settlement makes the balance sheet seem somewhat undercapitalized. Our discussions with other potential shareholders suggest that the balance sheet is definitely one source of concern.

We believe that ENDO is well prepared to better capitalize the balance sheet once they resolve their shareholder lawsuit. They have hired a small investment bank to consider a number of options:

- One option is to simply sell equity. Craig Davenport (CEO) has made it very clear that he has no intention of raising equity at these prices. This decision is partly a function of the feedback he’s received from existing shareholders.
- They could simply borrow money against the boxes that are in the field. Since the company has no other debt one would think ENDO could get at least $5mm as long as this amount is secured by the assets of the company. This would be a decent solution at least until the stock price is somewhat higher and raising equity seems more reasonable.
- We think the most likely solution is the sale of TIMM Medical as mentioned above. This would put over $14mm of cash on the balance sheet. We believe this is the primary reason that ENDO hired the investment bank.
- Finally, the CEO has mentioned that they could form some type of strategic relationship with a key player in the urology/oncology channel. We think this is also a potential outcome although it is anyone’s guess what form such a deal could take. One possibility is that they could license the foreign rights to their technology since ENDO does not have the resources to take advantage of international opportunities. JNJ and BSX have recently made moves in heat ablation of cancer. We believe both would have a strong interest in cryoablation as well. In addition, we believe there are a number of other companies that would jump at the chance to ally with ENDO who is leading this cryo space. A partnership would typically include some form of upfront payment which would serve to provide needed working capital.

Competition

There is only one other competitor in prostate cryo which is Galil Medical (Israeli company). Of late, Galil has been absorbed in a number of M&A transactions and is now a division of Amersham which is a division of GE. Galil did a partial merger (domestic rights only) with Amersham where Galil owns 25% in the U.S. and Amersham owns 75%. Amersham was then purchased by GE.

Apparently the transitions that Galil went through caused them to lose focus although there is evidence that they are begging to wake up and get somewhat more proactive about pushing boxes. It is not known how many boxes Galil currently has in the field but ENDO management estimates that they only do 15% to 20% of the procedures that ENDO does. Our discussions with urologists suggest that ENDO has superior technology and that years of under funding have left Galil well behind in second place. They both share the same basic technology but ENDO has about 30 additional patents on key areas of the functionality and ease of use of their machine. (Galil technology creates small ice balls which then requires more probes – seen by some as a complicating factor)

Given the very low penetration rates of cryo in prostate treatment, we believe that there’s room for both players. We are encouraged by the fact that there are really only two players who, at least in the intermediate term, should be the only ones who’ll have any success in prostate cryo. Other companies attempting to get into the space will find themselves many years behind and will face significant barriers in technology, patent protection, process know-how, doctor training, etc.

Other

ENDO is also researching the use of cryoablation in kidney cancer, lung cancer, and bone pain. These are all very large markets and ENDO has some early indications that cryo has efficacy in all these areas. Although these are certainly large markets, we do not at present assign any value to these indications although they has certainly been significant interest from leading oncology doctors. It is worth noting that in 2003 ENDO sold the rights for cryoablation in cardiac related conditions (primarily cardiac arrhythmias) for $10mm and a small declining royalty stream.

Valuation

It is commonly understood that before all of the accounting issues and management turnover, an acquisition offer was made by a large company for ENDO. The rumor is that JNJ offered $20 per share. Current management will not say what company made the offer or the specific price but they do confirm there was a clear offer and that the price was, “well into the double digits.” This offer was a few years ago when the number of procedures performed was less than half what it is today. We take great comfort in the belief that ENDO could quickly turn around and sell the company for what we believe would be many multiples of today’s share price. We do not see a sale as imminent though. Craig Davenport has a good sense of what his company could be worth (he has 1.0mm options at over $4 per share) and is committed getting the company beyond it its current problems and to growing the share price before contemplating a transaction. He’s right to think this way considering that ENDO was once a $20+ stock when in institutional favor.

Our valuation of ENDO is based on the assumption that TIMM Medical will be sold sometime in the next six months. We think this is the easiest and more obvious course for management to finance the balance sheet. With that in mind the valuation looks like:

~25mm Diluted Share x current share price of $2.30 = a market cap of $57.5mm

We calculate the enterprise value as $57.5 less $14mm from the TIMM Medical sales = EV of $43.5mm. We could include $11mm cash on the balance sheet to reach an EV of $32.5mm but we choose not to as we believe this is the amount of burn necessary to reach breakeven sometime middle of 2005. Thus we have a market cap of $57.5mm and an enterprise value of $43.5mm

Our valuation is based on the previously demonstrated procedure growth rate. We assume that by mid or perhaps late 2005 ENDO will be annualizing at 10k procedures per year. At an average revenue rate of $4.5k per procedure (number is comprises of three revenue types explained previously – management has guided to this number) this will represent $45mm in cryosurgery revenues. Thus, ENDO is trading less than 1.0x mid-2005 run-rate procedure revenues. By any measure this is cheap for a fast-growing medical device company with a razor / razor blade strategy, strong gross margins, and very limited Capex requirements.

Also, we expect by mid-2005 that blended gross margins should be better than 50%. At that rate (after all the current reorganization expenses and TIMM medical related expenses are gone) ENDO should be better than breakeven by mid to late 2005. Management has mentioned the back half of 2005 as a reasonable breakeven date. They also said they could be breakeven tomorrow if they needed to but that would require them to stop growing the business. We are more than happy to delay breakeven as they continue to train doctors ($20k-$25k per doc) and spread the word about cryo for prostate cancer as well as explore applications in other cancers.

Although 2006 is somewhat difficult to forecast at this time – we would expect at least a 50% increase in procedures over 2005. Revenue per procedure should be somewhat lower as more and more procedures are done boxes not owned by Endocare – we figure around $4200. At this point Endocare will be profitable although we’d be guilty of false accuracy if we tried to forecast costs and income. We imagine that ENDO will eventually sell itself. Craig Davenport came out of semi-retirement to fix this company but we do not suspect he wants to run it for five years. We’ll not try to speculate on what it might be worth in a transaction other than to say that other high growth, procedure based, medical device companies with 50%+ gross margins often get revenue multiples of 3x to 6x.

Risks
- ENDO tends to be a pretty volatile stock and frequently changes by 5%-10% in a single day
- Continued delay in reaching milestones will likely further alienate investors
- Some investors will continue to be wary of the stock until the balance sheet is better financed

Conclusion / Catalysts

We think that investors who buy today will in 12-15 months own a company that:
- Has rid itself of a shareholder lawsuit, an SEC investigation, and a DOJ investigation
- Is relisted on a major exchange (means large institutions can buy again)
- Is financially very healthy with a solid balance sheet and generating positive free cash flow
- Continues to grow at rapid rates as the far-ahead leader in curing prostate cancer with cryoablation. Even at this growth rate and when in ~12 months they are running at 10k procedures per year, they’ll have less than 6% penetration in their target market
- Will have even more leading urologists trained on Endocare systems
- Large urology / cancer treatment / device companies including JNJ and BSX would want to own ENDO (and for which someone offered $20 per share a few years back).
- Currently trades for less than 1x mid-2005 procedure revs with great gross margins very limited Capex required going forward

Mirum Pharmaceuticals Short Thesis 
 

We think Mirum Pharmaceuticals is a short.  The 9 month old company is a venture capital money grab at the expense of public equity buyers.  Mirum paid $7.5M upfront to acquire Maralixibat (Mara) from Shire. Mara has failed multiple Phase 2 trials including 3 trials in the specific indications Mirum plans to move forward.  With no new trials run in the interim and a scant $7M in R&D spend over the last 9 months, Mirum IPOed last Wednesday at a $370M market cap. Despite the slew of negative clinical data, Mirum plans to advance Maralixibat directly into Phase 3 trials with the war chest of capital raised from its crossover round and IPO.  In the unlikely outcome of clinical success, Maralixibat is heavily encumbered with hundreds of millions of milestones and 15%-25% royalties owed to a combination of Shire, Pfizer, Satigoen and Sanofi. To recap, a failed asset tossed in dumpster by Shire was purchased for $7.5M and immediately foisted on the public at a $370M valuation.  
  We first came across Mara (then LUM001 or SHP625) in our work on the Albireo (see our prior Albireo write up).  At that time, it was a failed asset competing against ALBO’s odevixibat (A4250). Shire came to own Maralixibat and Volixibat through its May 2014 $260M acquisition of Lumena immediately prior to Lumena’s IPO.  By April 2016, Mara had failed 5 Phase 2 trials including 2 in ALGS (IMAGO,ITCH trials) , 1 in PFIC (INDIGO trial), 1 in PBC (CLARITY trial) and 1 in PSC (CAMEO trial). Shire reached an agreement with former Lumena shareholders to terminate all future contingent milestones in September 2015 for $90M and subsequently wrote down the assets.  Despite the failures, Mirum will continue to run at PFIC (Progressive Familila Intrahepatic Cholestasis) and ALGS (Alagille Syndrome)
  Brief background on PFIC and ALGS
Cholestatic conditions (disruption of bile acid flow) in general affect an estimated 30K-50K children with no approved drugs.  PFIC is rare subset that impacts approximately 10K infants (~3,200 US and ~5,000 Europe). It is a genetic disorder where bile acid collects on the liver rather than circulated away in normal liver function.  PFIC leads to Cirrhosis and liver failure. Symptoms include pruritus (extreme itching) resulting in no sleep.  
  Without PEBD surgery or a liver transplant 50% die by age 10 with effectively 100% mortality by age 20.  Partial external biliary diversion (PEBD) surgery entails drilling a hole and mechanically draining the bile acid into a permanent external stoma bag.  While it is an effective solution, it is less than ideal given the need for a stoma bag and a 25% failure rate. Transplants come with their own set of risks, complications, and lifelong medications. 
  Like PFIC, ALGS is a genetic condition associated with liver, heart, eye, kidney and skeletal abnormalities. In particular, ALGS patients have fewer than normal bile ducts inside the liver, which leads to cholestasis and the accumulation of bile and causes scarring in the liver.  There are approximately 80-100 new ALGS patients per year with a prevalence of 9,000 in the US and 14,000 in Europe.  There are currently no drugs approved for the treatment of ALGS. 
  Failed trials in current indications
  Progressive Familila Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC) prior trials
Below is how MIRM presents the Lumena/Shire Phase 2 trial in PFIC.  The chart is master class in sleight-of-hand. To begin, the primary endpoint of the trial was the change from baseline to week 13 in fasting serum bile acid (sBA) which failed and did not reach statistical significance.  However, the chart does not distinguish between primary and secondary endpoints. The primary endpoint failure is listed in the fourth bullet point--there is a reason it’s called top line results not fourth line results. The secondary endpoint of the trial was a reduction from baseline to week 13 in pruritus as measured by the ItchRO(Obs).  This metric actually did reach statistical significance for the overall group, however it is not in the chart, though neither is the p value associated with the claimed stat sig. Rather the chart highlights 48-week pruritus data which is “clinically meaningful,” code for not statistically significant in biotech land. In what appears to be a post hoc analysis, MIRM claims a subset of the PFIC2 population (which was already a subset of the total PFIC population in the trial of 25 out of n=33) led to normalization (<8.5) or significant reduction (>70%) in sBA from baseline.  The subset of PFIC2 patients with non-truncating mutation of the bile salt export pump (BSEP) appears to be 15 patients. No aggregate statistical parameters were reported on the subset.

Safety issues
Mirum reports its safety profile for Maralixibat in its S-1 as follows: 
“The most commonly reported adverse events, or AEs, and serious adverse events, or SAEs, have been those of gastrointestinal, or GI, disorders such as diarrhea, abdominal pain and vomiting, and were mostly mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature. Reported treatment-related SAEs have consisted of abdominal pain, upper abdominal pain, diarrhea, cholangitis, increase in blood bilirubin, increase in international normalized ratio, increase in pancreatitis, ALT, autoimmune hepatitis, hematochezia, pure red cell aplasia, myelodysplastic syndrome and anemia.”
  We would like to see more disclosure of frequency and severity with respect to AEs, particularly diarrhea, which we have heard was significant.  We are particularly interested to know more details on the AEs associated with the ICONIC trial which had much higher dosing than the other two ALGS trials.  While Mirum was taking victory laps on the primary endpoint data, the safety was deemphasized and less than ideal. The April 2019 press release on preliminary data for ICONIC (https://mirumpharma.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/mirum-pharmaceuticals-presents-new-data-demonstrating-durable) was not encouraging (recall the N=31): “The Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in all patients, and in 22 of the patients, the TEAEs were considered potentially related to maralixibat. Serious TEAEs were reported in 15 patients, of which 5 of the patients experienced events considered potentially related to maralixibat. There was one TEAE that lead to discontinuation that was deemed not related to maralixibat. The most frequent TEAEs were fever, diarrhea, cough and abdominal pain.” 
  Some additional clinical disclosure around diarrhea and GI issues can be found in the clinical publication of Mara in a PBC study that showed 81% GI adverse events vs 54% in the placebo group. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6396374/.  
  Safety will be a front and center concern in the Phase 3 trials Mirum is running as the dosing is significantly higher than the Phase 2 trials.
  Phase 3 trials
PFIC
The Maralixibat PFIC Phase 3 trial plans to enroll 30 patients with nt-PFIC2.  PFIC has a very low incidence of 1 in 50-100K live births which equates to approximately 40-80 new patients per year in the US. PFIC2 accounts for roughly 60% of the total PFIC population and PFIC2 with the non-truncating mutation (nt) are 85% of PFIC2 population.   Thus the trial population incidence is consequently 20-40 new patients per year in the US. With respect to the current existing patients, there are approximately 1,500 nt-PFIC2 patients in the US and 2,500 in Europe. Albireo, which has significantly better efficacy and safety data is having a hard time enrolling its Phase 3 PFIC trial, which includes both PFIC1 and PFIC2 populations.  We think Mara will very difficult time in enrolling their phase 3 PFIC trial and have very little shot at meeting its estimated late 2020 data read out. 
  With respect to dosing, the Mara Phase 3 is using 600ug/kg BID.  This is over 2x higher than their maximum dose in their Phase 2 Indigo trial that maxed dosing at 280ug/kg BID.  It is a major red flag to have a Phase 3 completely different dosing than prior trials, particularly if the dose is significantly higher. 



ALGS
MIRM expects to start a Phase 3 trial in ALGS on in the first half of 2020.  The proposed trial design is similar to the ICONIC trial. MIRM thinks they have a shot at submitting an NDA based on their completed ICONIC Phase 2b trial.  They expect to have additional meeting with the FDA later this year to provide some clarity. This is perhaps the largest risk in the short thesis. However, we note the potential safety issues in the trial we detailed above. 
  Encumbered asset bought for peanuts
Concurrent the initial $60M Series A round in November of 2018, Mirum management (consisting of the Lumena management team that developed Mara) licensed Maralixibat and Volixbat from Shire for nominal $7.5M upfront payment and 1.9M shares of common stock.  While the initial asset creation was very inexpensive and ready made for an IPO, the burden going forward is much more expensive. MIRM owes Shire up to $110M in clinical development milestones and an additional $25M for each approved indication across PFIC, ALGS, and BA.  Should MIRM ever make it out of the clinic it owes low double digit to mid teen royalties to Shire. MIRM will owe an additional low single digit royalty to Pfizer. Sanofi also has a piece of the pie with regulatory and other milestones totaling $36M. MIRM owes Sanofi mid to high single digit royalties though the royalty portion may partially come out of Shire’s pocket. Not to be left out, MRIM owes Satiogen Pharma upwards of $20M in milestones and low single digit royalties, though that royalty may partially come out of Shire’s pocket.  
  To summarize, Mirum was able to acquire Maralixibat and IPO their company by spending $7.5M in cash but owe four different pharma companies potential milestones of $240M and net royalties ranging from 15%-25%.  This may be the fastest presto-chango, dead asset to public company creations we have witnessed. From initial creation and financing in November of $60M, a crossover round in April of another $60M followed by an $80M IPO in July creating a $370M market cap ($180M cash). 
  Specious Intellectual property
MIRM does not have a composition of matter patent on Mara.  In fact it does not have a method of use patent in the US or Europe yet.  It has ownership of a MOU patent application in the hands of USPO.  It appears this has been pending since at least April 2014 as the Lumena S-1 laid out the same IP situation back then: “We do not have patents or patent applications covering LUM001 [Maralixibat] as a composition of matter. Therefore, the primary intellectual property protection for our LUM001 program will be any patents granted on the pending method-of-use and formulation patent applications” We have no reason to believe they will be denied MOU IP, but it is odd they do not have it after all these years and cold comfort for a biotech to have such tenuous intellectual property rights for its primary shot on goal.
  Garbage in, garbage out
Mirum Pharmaceuticals looks like a money grab by venture capital at the expense of public equity buyers.
  To recap:
The sole assets of the company were purchased for $7.5M in cash from Shire 9 months ago and were IPOed at a $370M market cap last week with no additional trials nor meaningful R&D executed in the interim.
Maralixibat failed its PFIC Phase 2 trial and 2 out of 3 ALGS trials
The Phase 3 trial in PFIC is utilizing a dosage 2x higher than any previous Phase 2 trial
Safety data is questionable with limited disclosure and Phase 3 trial enrollment may be very difficult as Albireo has demonstrated
Maralixibat and Volixibat are heavily encumbered by large milestone payables and 15%-25% royalties 
MIRM does not yet have method of use patents issued for Maralixibat in the US and Europe which has been in process for over 5 years.
  Risks:
Potential accelerated approval for Maralixibat in ALGS
$180M war chest of capital
 I hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

BRE Properties Inc is a publicly traded REIT that owns, develops, and manages apartment buildings in the western part of the US.  As of FY 2010 year end, it owns 21,318 apartment units, and an 806 units development pipeline.  SF, LA, OC, San Diego and Seattle represent 88% of 2010 revenue.
  I am recommending a short position in BRE as
1)      Even the ""best case"" scenario cannot justify the current price of $48.64
2)      The ""limited new supply"" theme is no longer true
  Background : What happened in the last 2 years?
The apartment REIT sector has had a stellar rebound from the latest recession.  The Bloomberg US Apartment REIT index has returned more than 125% since March 2009.  The rebound is due to the following factors that are the direct results of the recent credit crisis:
Close to zero interest rate has forced investors to chase yield and compressed cap rates (earnings yield of commercial real estate).  Therefore, net asset value (NAV) of all REITs is up.
Higher demand - the marginal borrowers that could have qualified for mortgage loans before the crisis but now cannot and the owners who had their houses being foreclosed upon become renters
Limited new supply - new developments were halted as the word ""construction"" became toxic in the commercial real estate world in 2009. 
For a brief period in 2009 credit was extremely expensive for real estate companies.  The apartment sector was the exception as the GSEs continue to provide inexpensive financing throughout the crisis in their effort to support the residential real estate market.
  Earnings model
The business model of BRE is very simple and hence earnings visibility is quite high.  Apartment units are rented for 9 - 12 month terms.  Revenue is determined by occupancy and rent per unit.  Major expenditures are property expense, maintenance capex, corporate G&A and interest expense.
  In general, BRE's portfolio is of high quality, upper-scale apartment units located in supply-constrained area.  This can be confirmed through Google Map and its operating data.

  During that time period, BRE has exited Denver and Salt Lake City, sold assets in Inland Empire, Phoenix and Sacramental.
  As indicated above, BRE was able to maintain 94% plus occupancy and achieve rent/unit CAGR of 3.8% throughout FY 2004 - 10 through actively managing the portfolio.  These are impressive numbers as the downturn of 08 - 09 is included.
  Earnings power in best case scenario
Revenue, in a best case scenario, is defined as 100% occupancy.  Assuming $1,500 rent/unit/month (up from $1,417 in FY 2010), 22,124 units (21,318 + 806, assume pipeline is finished and 100% leased), revenue would be $398.2mm.

  Now, assuming normalized NOI margin of 68%, normalized capex/unit of $1,710, BRE's operating FCF would be $212mm.  ($398.2mm * 68% - $1,710 * 22,124 units - $20m corporate G&A)
  As of 1Q2011, BRE has $2.02B of interest bearing debt, assuming interest rate stays at the current level of 5.4% indefinitely (which is VERY unlikely) instead of the normalized 5.9%, FCF would be $212mm - $2.02B * 5.4% = $102.5mm, or about $1.36/share (75.44mm common shares/op units outstanding).
  Valuation
First and foremost, real estate is a cyclical business and over the long term should track inflation.  Prime real estate in supply-constrained areas should be able to grow earnings at 1 or 2% above inflation.  For margin of safety, let's assume BRE can grow FCF/share indefinitely at 5%/year.  I believe a debt-free business with 5% earnings growth is fairly valued at 20x multiple. 
*Unconsolidated JV earns less than $0.1/share so it's immaterial.
  BRE is highly indebted.  Its debt/best case operating FCF is $2,020/212 = 9.5x.  At $48.6, BRE is trading at 35.7x best case earnings.  Said differently, Mr Market is offering two AAA-rated companies - JNJ & MSFT - at 1/3rd of the multiple of BRE.  I believe BRE is over-valued even at $27.2/share.
  Catalyst
BRE has traded and stayed above $27 since Nov 2009.  Apartment rental rates and occupancy have been driven up in FY 2009 & 2010 due to higher demand and limited supply.  As the economy improves and house prices goes down, homeownership should go up that would lead to lower rental demand.  However, this is at least several years away.  So one can reasonably ask - why short now? 
  The answer is the limited supply story has broken.  Please see below:
  ""Our fourth quarter results also showed another period of significant investment activity. We completed almost $500 million in development. We started construction on five new communities with a total capital cost of about $300 million....""
  ""our business plan calls for a significant increase in investment activity with overall investment levels up around 25% from 2010. We expect to start around 850 million in new development this year. Combined with 650 million in starts last year we'll have around 1.4 billion under construction by the end of this year, a level consistent with that experienced in 2005 and 2006 or during the middle of the last cycle.""
AVB 4Q2010 earnings call
  ""With rents now increasing, we are pursuing development deals in several West Coast markets underwritten based on today's rents, development cap rates range from 5.5% to 6.25% or six and three-quarters, 7.5% upon stabilization...""
  ""Mike, one of your comments, I'm not sure I'm going to paraphrase it correctly, but you made it seem like you expect the development to come back fairly quickly like you did in last cycle, and that you were tracking  new development projects as a result, is that right?""

  ""we are commencing the development of a new community in Austin, Texas. Doing so, we are taking advantage of low construction pricing to put existing land into production at the leading edge of a new apartment cycle. Development will be our primary capital investment activity this year.""
  ""There is development activity here and there, but it hasn't ramped up significantly. And bankers will take - they're interested in lending more than they were, but it's still relatively slow.  Now, my expectation is that development is going to ramp up as the fundamental picture continues to get better.""

  Conclusion
Once the market realizes the supply of apartments are accelerating, BRE's multiple would contract.

The recent 20-25% price decline (on no news) creates a buying opportunity for this well managed company with a healthy competitive niche and a +20% ROIC business model with strong cash flow, currently valued at a FCF/EV yield of about 12% and selling at a significant discount to private market value as well as below comparable companies on a GAAP EPS basis. I believe there is a 40-60% appreciation potential in the shares from current levels to the $3.50-$4.00 level.

Metropolitan Health Networks (MDF) was posted on VIC on 5/11/04 by valuearb856 at a price of $0.96. First of all let me complement valuearb856 on what has turned out to be an excellent call on the shares of MDF and that anyone who followed the advice to purchase the shares have clearly been well rewarded. I will not spend a lot of time describing the company’s business in that the original posting included a good description of the company’s and outlined what has been a very impressive financial turnaround engineered by a relatively new management team. What I will add here (and expand upon below) is that since the original posting we have gotten better visibility into a number of key issues, including: the opportunity to see a couple of quarters of improved financial results and tangible evidence of what the new business model looks like, further insights into both the company’s growth plans and the underlying improvements in the industry from the changes in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2004, a strengthening of its relationship with its HMO partner, Humana, and re-listing its shares on the American Stock Exchange. However, where I respectfully differ with the author (and that what makes a market) regards the valuation of the shares. The recent VIC posting on 3/2/05 states that the shares are “no longer cheap” and calls investors to exit the shares at this time. Conversely, I believe that the recent 20-25% decline in the share price (on no real fundamental news that I am aware of) has brought the shares back to a level that makes them attractive for value investors who like well positioned/run companies with excellent ROIC and cash flow dynamics. The reasons why I differ with those who believe the shares are no longer attractive and the logic that supports my position is outlined below.

-- Since the original posting on MDF on VIC on 3/2/05 we have seen tangible evidence that the business transformation and financial turnaround at the company was not short term in nature and is in fact sustainable. From a financial perspective, revenues have shown a modest acceleration (aided by a minor acquisition), operating margins have increased from the 4-5% range to the 9-10% range, quarterly EPS has risen (aided somewhat by favorable seasonality) from the $0.03-$0.04 range to the $0.07-$0.08 range. Maybe most importantly, FCF has turned positive and has been tracking in the $3-4 million range per quarter, which has resulted in cash reserves increasing from about $1.4 million to what I estimate will be about $10 million in the soon to be reported December 2004 year end financial results (scheduled to be released on 3/22/05). In addition, management has renegotiated a favorable new contract with Humana and strengthened its management team and Board of Directors. THUS, THE CONCLUSION I COME TO IS THAT IT IS UNDISPUTABLE IN MY OPINION THAT RELATIVE TO THE ORIGINAL POSTING ON 5/11/04 MDF IS A MUCH STRONGER COMPANY WITH A MORE TANGABLE BUSINESS MODEL AND FAVORABLE INVESTMENT DYNAMICS THAT SHOULD BE ACCORDED A HIGHER VALUATION THAT LAST YEAR DURING ITS TURNAROUND PHASE!

-- Those investors who no longer believe the shares are attractive seem to anchor on fully taxed GAAP EPS as a reason to support their belief. I happen to believe GAAP EPS are not the best way to value a company, but for the time being I will go along with using this metrics. As best I could find, the closest comp to MDF is Continucare Corp (CNU), which also has NOLC’s and currently does not pay taxes. Thus on a relative valuation basis, the TTM P/E for CNU is about 16.2x vs. 11.5x for MDF. Even on a fully taxed GAAP basis, MDF’s P/E fully taxed EPS of $0.20 is currently only about 13x (below the non taxed P/E of CNU). In addition, if you compare MDF with a number of comparable Medicaid service providers like Amerigroup (AGP), Centene (CNC), Molina (MOH) and Wellcare Health (WCG), they all are valued on a TTM GAAP EPS P/E in the 20-30x range and on average about 22x 2005 estimates. Note, valuing the company at a more consistent 17-20x P/E with its peers on fully taxed GAAP EPS of $0.20, leads to a share price of $3.50-$4.00. THUS, THE CONCLUSION I COME TO IS THAT ON A GAAP EPS BASIS THE SHARES OF MDF ARE IN FACT CHEAP ON A RELATIVE BASIS!

-- Historically, I have found that valuing a stock on its FCF potential compared with its EV tends to be more meaningful than using a P/E on GAAP EPS in evaluating potential attractiveness of an investment idea. Indeed, the company’s strong FCF dynamics under the direction on the new management team is what has attracted me to the shares. On that basis my work shows that, assuming very little growth, the company should generate about $14M in FCF in 2006. Given the current EV of about $119M translates into a FCF/EV yield of about 12%. In the current environment, I am hard pressed to find companies like MDF, which have a good sustainable business model, a ROIC in excess of 20%, are well run by a management team that has demonstrated by their prior actions that they are doing the right things to enhance shareholder value and which is selling for a FCF/EV yield in the low teens. If other VIC members know of other candidates, please share them with all of us! However, one could argue that when the company’s NOLC’s run out (sometime in 2006, by my estimate), their FCF would be lower and would be correct. However, you need to consider that the FCF generated in the interim period would also lower the company’s EV assuming that management does not blow it on a dumb acquisition (not likely the case with MDF). So redoing the math to factor in a full 40% tax rate, my quick calculations show that in 2006 the FCF/EV yield (assuming some modest revenue growth, consistent profitability and the increased cash on the balance sheet) would approximate a 9.5% level. Note, I have found that most companies with a solid business model and who have a consistent ROIC in excess of 20% tend to trade at higher levels on a FCF basis. THUS, THE CONCLUSION I COME TO IS THAT FOR VALUE INVESTORS WHO FIND COMPANIES WITH GOOD CASH FLOW DYNAMICS AND A HIGH ROIC APPEALING, ESPECIALLY RELATIVE TO A FIRM’S ENTERPRISE VALUE, THE SHARES ARE ATTRACTIVE!

-- A recent acquisition of a somewhat similar (but not even a pure play like MDF) company in this space suggests that the stock is selling significantly below its private market value. In doing some research on the company, I noticed that in December 2004, Humana (the HMO that MDF has partnered with) acquired Care Plus Health Plans of Florida for $408M. Care Plus provides Medicare Advantage HMO plans and benefits to nearly 50,000 Medicare eligible members in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach. Thus, this is a business very similar to MDF, but in different areas of Florida. Importantly, this acquisition values each Medicare enrollee at about $8,160. If you apply the same value to MDF’s approximately 25,900 members, this works out to about $211M, or $4.20 per share. This represents about an 85% premium to the current stock price! Just to take this logic one step further, also back in December I noticed that MDF appointed Doug Carlisle, who is the SVP of Senior Products at non other than Humana to their Board of Directors. Of note, in listening to some of Humana’s recent investor presentations they have articulated their goal of increasing their Medicare membership in major markets. In that I am not an investment banker looking to broker a transition, I’ll stop short of trying to suggest something here. HOWEVER, THE CONCLUSION I COME TO HERE IS THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MDF AND HUMANA IS STRONG AND, MOREOVER, THE SHARES ARE SELLING WELL BELOW PRIVATE MARKET VALUE!

-- The last point I would make has to do with the possibility of acceleration in future growth, which importantly, is NOT factored into any of my forecasts nor the stock price. The move to set up its own HMO is clearly on opportunity, and one that seems to make sense. It is a little too early to analyze its profit potential as all the details are not yet available. Yes, there may be some initial costs, but one way of looking at them is that MDF’s management is using its NOLC tax benefit savings to fund a potentially new growth area for the company. However, a more interesting potential growth driver for MDF could be an increase in Medicare enrollment. Noteworthy, as a result of the recent changes from the MMA, the multi-year continuous decline in Medicare enrollments in MDF’s territories has stopped and there are some early signs that they could begin to show positive growth in the future. What I found interesting in reviewing some of the publicly available government data on quarterly changes in Medicare enrollment data for MDF’s three major counties in South Florida was a significant change over the last few quarters in the number of Medicare enrollees. Most importantly, after many years of steady and significant declines, the data now shows enrollments have stopped declining and in fact have even now turned positive. For example, the trend for the change in Medicare enrollment for MDF’s three major counties over the last 8 quarters is: -2,015, -1,509, -1,048, -818, -1,113, -282, +171, and +158. Another significant point of interest in this regard are the very bullish forecast that MDF’s HMO partner Humana made saying they believe Medicare enrollment growth will approximate 10-15% in 2005. In order to help make this happen, Humana has put in place a very aggressive advertising campaign to get the word out and grow membership. If Humana is successful with these efforts, MDF would clearly be a major beneficiary. Despite this push by Humana, prudence tells me that one should not believe that enrollments should all of a sudden turn around overnight and begin a period of double digit growth. In fact, I think the 10-15% growth in Medicare enrollments projected by Humana is somewhat aggressive and have for conservative reasons, have not factored this into my forecasts. HOWEVER, THE CONCLUSION I COME TO IS THAT AFTER A MULTI-YEAR PERIOD OF HAVING THE WIND IN ITS FACE RELATIVE TO MEDICARE ENROLLMENTS, MDF IS LIKELY TO NOW HAVE THE WIND AT ITS BACK, WHICH IS LIKELY TO TRANSLATE INTO SOME GROWTH, WHICH TENDS TO ATTRACT A WHOLE NEW GROUP OF GROWTH/GARP INVESTORS!
Catalyst

Overview:
  Broadridge (ticker: BR) is the dominant player within the niche business of proxy distribution, which constitutes the majority of its profitability.  Given Broadridge's extremely high market share, the significant barriers to entry in the industry, and the recurring nature of the business, this represents a very attractive cash flow stream.  Broadridge currently trades at an undeservedly cheap valuation, with several catalysts that should help narrow the discount to fair value.
  Business:
  Mack885 did an excellent job writing up the business a few years ago, much of which still applies today.  I'll quickly run through the dynamics of the various segments, though feel free to reference the prior write-up for additional detail.
  Broadridge began as a segment of ADP, building its dominant position within the proxy distribution industry in the 90's both organically and through acquisition.  Over the years, it also developed two smaller segments, trade processing and clearing.  In 2007, ADP spun the business out as an independent entity into its current form.  The CEO and COO have run the business since the late 80's/early 90's and stayed with the company post-spin.
  Broadridge has two primary segments today:
  Investor Communications (ICS):
  This is Broadridge's largest segment, representing ~71% of revenue and ~65% of EBITDA.  ICS is by far the dominant player within the proxy distribution, having close to a monopoly position of the ""street name"" portion of the industry, which in turn represents 75-80% of US equity shares.
  Given the somewhat obscure nature of the business, some quick background is helpful in understanding their very strong position within the industry.  In order to facilitate trade clearance and settlement, the Depository Trust Company serves as a central depository allowing ownership changes to take place without a physical exchange of documentation required.  Its related entity, the National Securities Clearing Corp allows multiple trades to be netted against each other, further facilitating trade settlement.  The DTC only tracks the economic ownership of the broker dealers with which it interacts, while the broker dealers maintain the records containing the beneficial ownership of these shares.  The majority of the US market operates under this system (~75-80% of shares).
  Complexity arises from the SEC mandates requiring public issuers and mutual funds to provide shareholders with various pieces of information (proxy materials, annual/semi-annual reports, etc.).  For the significant number of shareholders whose accounts are held in ""street name"", the broker dealers are responsible for distributing proxy information and are compensated by the issuer on a per-unit basis for this service.  Given the economies of scale, Broadridge serves as the outsourced platform that broker dealers then hire to interface with issuers, maintain ownership data, and ultimately distribute the proxy information.  This results in an attractive dynamic where Broadridge is actually hired by the broker dealers, though their fees are ultimately paid for by the issuers.  The costs to issuers are insignificant for most companies, with pricing generally set by the NYSE in consultation with Broadridge.  As a result, Broadridge essentially has a monopoly business where their direct customers are not focused on pricing, and where the small scale of the fees merits little attention from the issuers who ultimately pay the fees.
  There were initially some concerns about recent changes to the fee structure known as notice & access meant to increase shareholder participation and reduce costs through increased electronic distribution of proxy materials.  However, the changes implemented end up substituting a high revenue/low margin product (physical mailing of proxy materials), for low revenue/high margin products (compensation for suppression of multiple mailings and electronic delivery of materials) that ends up being neutral to beneficial to Broadridge.
  The underlying growth driver of the business is stock record and mutual fund position growth, historically in the low-to-mid single digit range with some cyclicality introduced around event-driven business (i.e. proxy fights, merger votes, etc.).
  Securities Processing (SPS):
  Representing ~35% of EBITDA, SPS is Broadridge's other primary segment.  Through SPS, Broadridge is a provider of outsourced trading operations to many of the large US broker-dealers.  Revenue tends to be relatively recurring, with their broker relationships protected by long-term contracts, though a majority of revenue is derived from transaction-based sources.  The business is roughly 75/25 US/International, and largely equity based (though there is a small fixed income portion as well).
  Within this business, Broadridge provides outsourced trade capture, execution, confirmation, settlement and execution, as well as individual productivity tools that interface with their solution.  Given the economies of scale, Broadridge seeks to provide cost savings to customers versus the use of in-house systems.
  This segment has been less attractive than ICS historically, with the biggest issue being continued consolidation of their customer base.  That said, trading growth over the longer-term is very beneficial to margins, given the operating leverage inherent in the segment.
  Another issue within the segment is that management believes a strong balance sheet is required in order to be a credible competitor within this segment, limiting the ability of the company to take on leverage.  This contrasts significantly with ICS, which given its recurring nature and low capital intensity should be able to support substantial leverage.  As there are limited obvious synergies between the segments, this certainly creates inefficiency within the overall company's capital structure.
  Clearing and Outsourcing (COS):
  This has been a very small loss-making portion of the company that was historically marketed as an adjunct to their Securities Processing products.  Broadridge recently exited the business, selling it to Penson.  BR still provides securities processing and back-office services, but the sale importantly has allowed them to release ~$240m of balance sheet cash as well as receiving cash proceeds for the sale itself.
  Potential catalysts:
  1) Share buybacks: Given the closing of the Penson acquisition and overly conversative balance sheet, continued share buybacks by management would be beneficial
  2) Capital Structure:While management seems reluctant to separate the segments, A significantly more efficient capital structure could be achieved with a separated ICS business allowing it to take on the higher amounts of leverage it could support
  3) LBO: Again, management has seemed resistant, but the ICS segment in particular would be an attractive target for private equity
  Risks:
  1) Continued customer consolidation
  2) Regulatory change that significantly modifies the proxy distribution system
  3) Exposure to trading volumes

2006-07-03,tbzeej825,GE,General Electric,https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/General_Electric/6354999495,10398000000.0,33.33,"Description
General Electric is a diversified company that is a microcosm of the global economy. GE owns world-class assets in engines, power equipment, medical imaging and healthcare, appliance manufacturing, media, and water infrastructure, as well as commercial and consumer finance. With a 3% real dividend yield and a 50% payout ratio, GE is trading at under 15x FY2007 earnings estimates of $2.25 per share. The valuation of GE relative to the 10 year Treasury, TIPS, and small-to-midcap US stocks is currently at historically cheap levels.

As one of only six Triple A rated industrial companies in America, over 30 years of growing dividend payments, over 100 years of consecutive dividend payments, a strong buyback program, and the only remaining member of the original Dow Jones Industrial Average, GE presents a low-risk, exciting investment opportunity for investors over the next 3-5 years. GE is likely to perform well in a slowing economic environment in the US and experience multiple expansion and earnings growth in a base-case scenario. Alternatively, GE will at the minimum be an excellent defensive stock if the market declines significantly and/or the economy enters a recession.

This report will argue that GE’s low valuation is due to several reasons. 1) Mega-cap companies usually trade in a group and are very cyclical. For understandable reasons, small-to-midcap stocks in the United States have had relative leadership in the market since the vicious sell-off of 1998 until the first quarter of 2006. A lot of analysts and investors erroneously think this will last forever. GE and other mega-caps including conglomerates were overvalued in the late 1990s. Investors have a difficult time understanding and/or are apathetic now that GE is undervalued eight years later. 2) The “natural” owners of GE who are large mutual funds have weak 1, 3, and 5 year performance according to the Lipper rankings and thus are having a difficult time raising money from individuals and institutions who have been mostly speculating on housing, commodities, hedge funds, and/or emerging markets. 3) Since the October 2002 / March 2003 bottom, watching the VIX was like seeing paint dry, the Federal Reserve has been on auto-pilot, and very few investors have taken the prospect of risk seriously. In this type of environment coming out of a recession, the safety, diversity, and durability of GE’s earnings stream and dividend mattered little to investors who felt invincible and flocked to the most speculative parts of the market. 4) Hedge funds have become the new asset class de jour. Value investing in small-to-mid caps has never been more popular. Even on VIC, it is nearly impossible for any company to get a good rating unless it is a misunderstood spin-off or breakup where the numbers are sandbagged, a company emerging from bankruptcy that will beat the plan, no analyst coverage, in a cyclical business, or international in nature. Over the last two years, only two large-cap companies (Viacom and Tyco) have received 6.0+ ratings and both of them were spin-offs.

Company-specific reasons include: 1) Investors believe that GE is too big to grow at the same rate it has in the past. 2) Growth opportunities in China and India among other emerging markets are being given little to no option value. 3) The market does not believe organic revenue growth can be 5% - 8% in the future and that total earnings growth can exceed 10%. 4) GE is perceived to be a financial services company in disguise supposedly warranting a lower multiple comparable to Citigroup, JP Morgan, and Bank of America due to its ‘black-box’ nature. A lot of investors do not understand the business profile of GE’s financial services businesses, what the risks are, and how the business has changed recently.

With clear evidence of housing and commodities slowing, weakness at the consumer level, the inverted yield curve, and the economic expansion into its fifth year, the time is right for GE to come back into favor among investors as its irresistible combination of stability and solid relative earnings growth will attract investors as it has done in countless number of economic and market cycles—most recently in the ‘Goldilocks’ period from 1994-1998.

Business: GE is a diverse company with the following business breakdown in order of size.

Global Infrastructure: 35%
Commercial Finance: 20%
International Consumer Finance: 11%
Industrial: 10%
Healthcare: 10%
Media: 10%
US Consumer Finance: Only 4%

Misconception about GE: We believe that GE is too big and diverse for investors to have much of an edge analyzing the individual prospects of each business. For more information, please review GE’s Annual Report and/or sell-side research. Performing field checks, talking to customers, or meeting with suppliers is not going to add much value. A lot of people on VIC do not want to invest in equities where there is no information edge.

On a company-specific level, the important thing is that GE is not a US financial services heavy company anymore given the Genworth Financial IPO and secondary offerings complete as well as reinsurance having been sold to SwissRe. Both are low-multiple businesses. However, GE is now a low-cost provider of global financial services with a bullet-proof credit profile. GE generates returns from its intimate understanding of niche business and consumer markets and its low cost of capital. GE is neither a broker-dealer as it terminated Kidder Peabody in 1994, a retail bank serving Mom and Pop customers since it owns no retail branches in the US, nor hedge fund in disguise.

If anything, relative value investors should compare GE to Berkshire Hathaway instead of bulge bracket firms and large commercial banks. GE is adamant about the fact that it seeks a matched book. The low volatility of its financial services profits over time speaks for itself. In addition, GE makes a conscious effort to generate returns from fees and originations during times such as today when risk is under-priced and there is strong appetite for all types of paper. GE tends to use its balance sheet during weaker times.

Currently, a lot of analysts are encouraging GE to spin-off the entertainment unit because of underperformance, but we believe this perception is being driven by a cyclical distrust of conglomerates and large companies. The pervasiveness of this group think has caused several media, industrial, and business services companies to believe that breaking up is a permanent solution to business issues and will lead to higher valuations by the market. Maybe some of these companies will benefit from the split-ups, but it has yet to be proven. With the breadth of GE’s businesses, it is likely that from time to time certain businesses will experience short-term hiccups or potentially even experience secular issues, but in aggregate they are unlikely to result in declining earnings over the long-run.

Specifically, we believe a lot of investors are misunderstanding GE’s businesses. From a big picture perspective, a majority of GE’s earnings come from late-cycle plays including infrastructure, commercial finance, energy, and industrial. This is demonstrated by the fact that GE’s revenues and operating profits were not particularly strong out of the gate in 2002-2003 after the 2001 business recession. If the housing slowdown and recent weakness in the consumer continue as the inverted yield curve and other data points suggests is likely, we believe GE’s strength in the latter part of the economic cycle will help improve investor perception.

In 2002, a lot of noise was made by Bill Gross and other experts about GE’s funding strategy and reliance on inexpensive commercial paper funding to support its growth. Previously, GE exploited its strong reputation in the capital markets to fund many acquisitions in 2001. The committed bank facilities in place to back its CP program were not reassuring. In addition, GE’s pension plan used to be under-funded and there were some questionable gains booked through the P&L in 2002 and 2003. Earnings Per Share was not correlating with Operating Income.

Whether or not this was responsible is up to debate, but GE now has a fully-funded pension plan using very conservative assumptions and increased committed bank facilities in place. In 2003, Bill Gross eventually admitted he was aggressively buying GE paper in the market shortly after making his controversial remarks. Three years later, operating free cash flow minus maintenance capital expenditures is growing much more rapidly than many expected, new orders and the company backlog are robust across its business lines, and GE has an excellent liquidity position to support a growing dividend, capital reinvestment, and stock buyback program. In the future, we believe 110 years of unparalleled excellence is sufficient for GE to use its low funding cost to support its acquisitions and internal growth globally, especially given the low risk premium for other pieces of paper. We expect the company to use unsecured paper to make many global acquisitions to enhance its footprint.

Will the capital markets freeze funding on GE? Maybe, but this scenario is extremely unlikely and difficult to imagine.

International Growth Opportunities: In 2005, approximately 52% of GE’s revenue was generated from outside the United States. Specifically, developing markets are likely to contribute 15% - 20% of GE’s revenue in the next couple of years. Many investors may not know that GE started doing business in China and India before World War I and it would be one of the largest companies on a stand-alone basis in either country.

CEO Jeff Immelt has publicly stated that revenue from India will grow over 50% a year over the next several years to $8 billion by 2010. For example, GE has established a partnership with the State Bank of India to sell financial services to millions of consumers through branches and wholesale relations. GE’s expertise in infrastructure has allowed the Company to make significant inroads in India. In addition, GE has indicated sales in China are growing over 40% annually as of the second quarter of 2006 and Immelt has guided investors to similar growth targets as India. Revenues in China were over $5 billion in 2005. FYI, Citigroup has an excellent report from June 19 illustrating the growth opportunities of China and India.

On April 26th 2006, Immelt stated that revenue from emerging markets could double from $25 billion in 2006 to $50 billion in 2010 led by growth in infrastructure and financial services. While this goal may seem aggressive, we believe this profit stream and option is extremely valuable regardless if Immelt’s aggressive targets are reached. At least some of GE’s businesses should have relevance to emerging markets. Investors who are rightfully optimistic about the prospects of emerging markets will eventually realize owning equity in GE is an ideal, low risk way to capture this upside.

Management Guidance: Over a full economic cycle, management has guided investors to 8% revenue growth or two to three times global GDP and earnings per share growth over 10%. This organic revenue growth estimate was raised from 5% in 2004. Given that GE is a disciplined acquirer of businesses with a proven ability to integrate better than almost any company in the world, we believe these targets could potentially be exceeded. It is strange to us that that the market has such little respect for GE’s growth plans given the strong history of execution, several recent insider purchases by Immelt and other Directors at comparable price levels, and reasonable assumptions. With a 3.0% dividend yield and management’s estimate of over 10% earnings growth, GE could generate a nominal return of 13%. This yield relative to Treasuries at 5.2% and inflation expectations currently around 2.5% over the long-run is quite attractive.

Price Target: We believe that GE is currently undervalued based on intrinsic value. The diversity of GE’s business units and the unparalleled success of the conglomerate over all types of economic environments combined with strong free cash flow and high incremental return on invested capital is attractive. If earnings and dividends can grow 8% to 10% a year in the next 10 years, which is lower than management’s guidance and significantly lower than the 12% rate at which GE grew over the last 30 years, then we believe GE deserves a P/E multiple of 20x to 23x forward earnings based on a cost of capital of 6% - 8%. This is a reasonable premium that is 140 bps above GE’s 10 year paper and 200 bps over the 10 year swap curve at 5.7%. Low tax rates on long-term capital gains and dividends after the 2003 tax cuts relative to Treasuries as well as decreased transaction costs are also solid reasons to support multiple expansion for GE.

In three years, we believe GE will be valued at approximately $60 a share based on analyst estimates of $2.75. Including dividends, investors could receive a return of approximately 20% per year with very low risk.

Earnings Dividends

FY2006: $2.00 $1.00
FY2007: $2.25 $1.12
FY2008: $2.50 $1.25
FY2009: $2.75 $1.37

If the economy experiences a recession that affects business and consumer spending, we believe GE could miss FY2009 earnings estimates by 25% and earn around $2.00 a share—which is the FY2006 estimate. Given the strong balance sheet and solid history of the company, we believe a worst-case 13x multiple on depressed earnings would likely result in a $30 stock price in three years including dividends. However, this multiple is very unrealistic in our opinion unless 10 year Treasury rates rise to 10%+.

The ironic thing about GE is that all of the dumb money investors who were willing to pay any price in the late 1990s and during the Nifty Fifty period were generally right about the big picture. In the future, GE will be well positioned to benefit from global growth in emerging markets such as China and India in addition to continued moderate growth in the US and other mature countries. There is no substitute for buying a great business that pays a nice dividend and grows its earnings steadily each year provided the price is reasonable.

A lot of small-to-midcap value investors will have difficulty understanding how and why paying a relatively high multiple for GE is better than paying what appears to be a low multiple of earnings for weaker, smaller businesses in many cyclical industries that have questionable sustainability of earnings power.

We are confident sentiment will eventually change—it’s more a question of when, not if.

Options: We believe GE options are a lucrative way of capturing the upside in the stock price because of the low implied volatility due to low interest rates and a tight trading range recently. The price of January 2008 $30 calls is only $5.80 and the $40 calls are only $1.15 on a stock price of $33.33. If GE stock appreciates to $50 by January 2008 which is very reasonable, the $30 calls and $40 calls would provide upside of 240% and 770% respectively. The implied premium including dividends is under 8%.

Risks

1) The strength in the economy continues. GE continues to grow but experiences multiple contraction or stagnation. Investors prefer riskier assets for longer than we think.

2) Interest rates go to 10% or higher and the earnings and dividend yield are not as attractive to TIPS. Profit margins decrease and GE does not grow earnings for some time.

3) GE does a poor job allocating capital in the 21st century by overpaying for acquisitions and spending too much money on R&D.

4) GE fails to gain any traction in emerging markets and the United States economy experiences Japanese like deflation.

5) GE Capital experiences a six-sigma event and blows up. In a less dramatic scenario, GE has to hold more capital like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or experiences significant price competition thus depressing ROE.

Main Points:
Major New Product Launch: Kopin (KOPN) is on the cusp of launching a revolutionary wearable computing device called the Golden-i (http://www.mygoldeni.com/).  Investing in KOPN is like investing in Apple on the eve of the iPhone launch.
Dominant Patent Portfolio:  KOPN has invested over 100% of its free cash flow over the last three years to develop and patent many of the key features of Golden-i.  KOPN’s portfolio of 250 patents gives it a moat around key features such as resolution of near eye displays as well as noise cancelation technology that Google, Apple and others will likely violate when they enter the market with competing commercial products.  The strength of KOPN’s patent portfolio is evidenced by a license that Motorola Solutions (MSI) signed with KOPN which pays a double digit royalty.
Hands-Free, Voice Activated Portable Computing has the Potential to be Huge:  Google’s Project Glass legitimizes the market for wearable computing (https://plus.google.com/+projectglass/posts).  Growth could be huge: 8 years ago there were nearly zero smartphones sold annually, 3 years ago 200 million, and 1 billion will be sold in 2014.  There are approximately 6 billion mobile phone subscribers in the world.  KOPN is targeting the consumer market with a $400-$700 Bluetooth headset-like device that could gain major traction.  Following a fraction of the adoption curve of smartphones, the potential TAM for KOPN is enormous: $50 billion (100 million devices at $500 ASP).  At a 5% royalty rate on 20% market share, KOPN could generate in excess of $500mm annually in high margin license revenue (>4x its current EV).       
HC1 Device Launch with Motorola Solutions (MSI): KOPN launched an industrialized version of the Golden-i called HC1 with MSI on October 22, 2012.  This is noteworthy because it demonstrates KOPN’s ability to develop a commercial wearable computing device as well as partner with a major electronics company.  MSI is the exclusive licensee for industrial applications only; KOPN is free to license its technology to other companies outside of the industrial market.  HC1 is the only hands-free, voice activated portable computing device on the market today.  The MSI relationship has the potential to generate $4m in royalty revenue in 2013 and $20m in 2014.
Strong Relationship with Verizon (VZ): KOPN showed the Golden-i for the first time publicly at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January 2012 in Verizon’s booth.  Seventy five small consumer electronics companies attempted to get into the booth and only five were chosen, KOPN being one of them.  We believe that a consumer Golden-i device fits well within VZ’s LTE roadmap as it would drive significant data usage and be a great retention tool for its high end subscriber base.  We also note that iPhone exclusivity was a huge coup for AT&T (T) in its early smartphone battle with VZ and we believe that KOPN could be in a strong position to negotiate a similar deal with a potential mobile partner.  We look forward to CES in January 2013 to see first-hand an update to the VZ relationship.
Insider Purchases: Founder and CEO John Fan made his first purchase EVER in March 2012, buying just over 100K shares at ~$3.50.  Note that KOPN has been a public company for 20 years.  He is the company’s largest individual shareholder, beneficially owning about 3.7m shares.  The company’s CTO Dr. Hong Choi also purchased 30K shares.
Stable Core Business and Strong Balance Sheet: KOPN’s semiconductor business is a functional duopoly and they enjoy long-term relationships with key customers.   KOPN currently has $94.5m in cash ($1.43 per share) and no debt on its balance sheet. 
Business Overview:
KOPN has three business lines:
III-V: KOPN manufactures gallium-arsenide HBT wafers and sells them to power amplifier makers such as Skyworks (SWKS, ~25% of revenue), Triquint (TQNT) and RF Micro Devices (RFMD) for use in mobile phone antennas.  The drivers in this business line include increased sales of mobile devices globally as well as the migration of mobile networks to 3G and LTE services which require multiple power amplifiers per device. 
Microdisplays: KOPN manufactures CyberDisplay™ miniature high density color LCD screens for use in military applications such as thermal weapons sights (TWS) as well as in consumer applications such as camcorders and digital cameras. 
Golden-i: This is discussed in much more detail below.
KOPN was founded in 1984 and is headquartered in Taunton, Massachusetts.  KOPN is effectively a spin out from the Electronic Materials Group at MIT, Dr. Fan’s former employer.
Golden-i Overview:
The Golden-i is a computing platform (Windows CE, Android) supporting a head-mounted, voice activated wireless device coupled with a one inch near eye high resolution display that appears to the user to be the equivalent of a 15 inch LCD monitor.  The first major set of use cases for the Golden-i are in industrial applications where the user requires access to critical information in real time while maintaining the ability to use both hands: police, fire, EMT, military, service technicians in the aeronautical, HVAC and telecom sectors, manufacturing, logistics, warehousing, construction and healthcare.  Customers who have demoed the device include the US military, Mercedes-Benz, British Telecom and FedEx.  
MSI is a fantastic first partner for KOPN; it is the world's largest seller of ruggedized handheld computing devices and generates revenue of more than $8B annually.  From our research we believe that MSI looked into the head-mounted computing space before they partnered with KOPN and attempted to build their own device but failed due to technical difficulties as well as problems getting around KOPN's sizeable patent portfolio.  As a result, they decided to team up with KOPN to launch the Motorola HC1 rather than compete directly.  HC1 is the world’s first head-mounted voice controlled mobile computing device.  MSI signed ‘the largest royalty deal in the history of Motorola’ with KOPN; for every HC1 sold KOPN earns a royalty ‘in the low double digits.’  MSI and KOPN project the total addressable market (TAM) for Golden-i to be over $10B over the next decade.  The current annualized global sales for rugged laptops, tablets and handhelds is approximately $5B annually according to VDC Research.  Assuming gradual adoption we believe KOPN can earn $4m in royalty revenue in 2013 and $20m in 2014 from the MSI deal alone assuming unit sales of 10,000 in 2013 and 50,000 in 2014, an ASP of $4,000 and a 10% royalty rate.  This would result in a boost to EPS of $0.05 in 2013 and $0.20 in 2014.  More information about the HC1 can be found here: http://www.motorola.com/Business/US-EN/Business+Product+and+Services/Mobile+Computers/Wearable+Computers/HC1
KOPN showed the Golden-i to the public for the very first time at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January 2012 at the Verizon booth.  This is notable for two reasons: 1) the fact that Verizon invited KOPN into their booth to show off an entirely new type of mobile device and 2) Sergey Brin (one of Google’s founders and currently head of special projects) saw the device and is reported to have said, “This is the coolest f***ing thing at the show.”  We do not believe it is a coincidence that Google’s Project Glass became public for the first time shortly thereafter.  Google’s Project Glass is a wearable computing device similar to Golden-i; a near eye display computing device with voice control.  Specifically, Sergey Brin started showing off a prototype publicly in April 2012.  While Google has talked about a developer prototype launch in 1H13 and a possible consumer launch in late 2013 or 2014, we would note that KOPN has already launched a working commercial product via MSI.  While detractors would say ‘You can’t compete with Google,’ we would argue that KOPN has no intention of doing so directly and is currently working on signing a license deal with a consumer electronics company like Samsung or HTC.  It is also noteworthy that Time Magazine named Project Glass as one of the world’s best inventions of 2012 despite the fact that the product is just a prototype.
Most importantly, we expect KOPN to partner with a consumer electronics manufacturer to produce and distribute a consumer device via a major channel partner, such as Verizon.  Potential manufacturing partners include companies like Samsung and HTC.  On the most recent earnings call management noted, “Motorola’s HC1 is just the first of what we expect to be a new class of cloud computing handsets and visors with KOPN’s Golden-i technology platform.’  Further, they noted, ‘Beyond the industrial segment, KOPN is now actively working with additional OEM partners on the development of Golden-i-enabled computer systems for professional, consumers and other users…Please stay tuned for future announcements and alliances that build on this success and complement our objectives.’  Further, note that the consumer version of the Golden-i will not look at all like the Motorola HC1; we do not expect consumers to wear anything quite so cumbersome.  The consumer version of the device has a bill of materials (BOM) similar to that of a smartphone, looks much like a large Bluetooth headset and fits in a shirt pocket. 
The partnership with a major channel partner, like Verizon, will be important as it will get Golden-i into the hands of consumers and it will enable faster adoption as a major carrier is likely to offer a sizeable subsidy the same way they do with smartphones.  If, for example, KOPN were to sign a deal with Verizon the potential would be huge: Verizon Wireless (VZW) currently has 96m subscribers and partner/45% VZW shareholder Vodafone currently has 95m subscribers in Europe and over 400m subscribers globally.  Two percent penetration of the VZ/VOD subscriber base would result in $250 million in license revenue for KOPN at a 5% royalty rate and $500 ASP.  As an aside, the Golden-i was demoed by Verizon at the Super Bowl in 2012; security personnel at the game were able to call up video feeds onto the near-eye display from video cameras around the stadium using only their voice.  
So where does all of this discussion around Golden-i get us?  Let’s consider the smartphone market: unit sales globally were nearly zero in 2004, 200 million in 2009 and will reach 1 billion in 2014.  If head-mounted devices like Golden-i and Project Glass are 10% the size of the nascent smartphone market in 2009 and Golden-i has 20% market share that would imply unit sales of 4 million by 2015.  At a $500 wholesale price and a 5% royalty that would imply just over $100m of EBIT for KOPN and the company would generate over $1.00 in EPS, growing rapidly.  Further, if penetration reaches 10% of the smartphone market (100 million units) then the earnings stream becomes enormous.  Thus, any investment in KOPN needs to be predicated on 1) a point of view on the potential market and 2) the KOPN patent portfolio.  (For 2014 our research indicates KOPN could easily earn $20 million in license revenue on consumer products alone, assuming 800k units sold or < 1% penetration of VZ’s current domestic subscriber base.)

  EVENT-DRIVEN IDEA: TNET BB
  DESCRIPTION
Telenet Group Holding NV (TNET BB) provides television, telephone and Internet services through a network of fiber-optic and coaxial cable, as well as mobile services using an MVNO model.  The company is the largest cable service provider in Belgian covering the Northern half (Flanders) of the country.  Liberty Global (LBTYA) is the controlling shareholder with just above 58% ownership.        
  THESIS
I love investing in cable globally, I love levered equities and – for the most part – betting with John Malone has been very rewarding for shareholders. 
This is a pretty straightforward thesis:
Bet on M&A (LBTYA)
Bet on Malone (Tax Efficiency, Dividends and Buybacks)
I believe that TNET can provide a +25-50% return to shareholders in the next 6-18 months through a combination of buybacks, dividends and earnings growth.
Separately, I believe there is a very high likelihood that controlling shareholder LBTYA bids for the shares they do not currently own in the next 6-9 months. If LBTYA de-levers as I think they will when they buy ZIGGO NV (see my previous writeup), then TNET will be next on the agenda.  The Liberty playbook is pretty straightforward.
Note: Press reports indicate LBTYA has revived discussions to acquire Dutch broadband provider Ziggo as Malone prepares to expand his footprint in the region. Ziggo said in an e-mailed release that it is currently in discussions with Liberty Global regarding a potential offer. Liberty’s CFO said that it was still interested in acquiring Ziggo, but only at the right price.
  INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS
1) Macro/Competitive Environment
Similar to Ziggo, TNET operates in one of Europe’s more attractive cable markets characterized by an oligopolistic structure, high population density, network ubiquity, wealthy population and numerous growth opportunities. In addition to strong industry tailwinds, Telenet benefits from a growing market share, increasing penetration and ARPUs, solid FCF generation, potential opportunities for expansion into wireless as well as an attractive valuation. 
2) High Visibility Business Model
The cable business model is one of the most attractive out there – a subscription model with high-visibility and high incremental margins once capex is completed. TNET has fully upgraded its network, and is now competing against a telephony incumbent (Belgacom) with a technological disadvantage. Belgacom has never shown any desire to compete aggressively, and I expect competitive dynamics to remain stable.
3) Capital Returns
TNET has continued its policy of high capital returns to shareholders after announcing a €7.90 dividend (May 2013), or ~20% of market cap at time of announcement. In conjunction with the extraordinary dividend, TNET announced an ordinary buyback of €50mm to purchase shares below €35.  Lastly, TNET has publicly stated a policy of returning 100% of FCF and levering up towards 4.5x net debt/EBITDA, implying an annual capital return of at least €500mm (~10% of current market cap) for the next few years.
TNET Shareholder Disbursements
May 3, 2013:      €7.90 per share (Gross extraordinary dividend)
May 7, 2012:      €1.00 per share (Gross dividend)
Aug 28, 2012:     €3.25 per share (Net capital reduction)
July 26, 2011:    €4.50 per share (Net capital reduction)
July 28, 2010:    €2.23 per share (Net capital reduction)
Aug 27, 2009:     €0.50 per share (Net capital reduction)
Nov 19, 2007:    €6.00 per share (Net capital reduction)
Over the past year, capital returns totaled approximately one-third of TNET’s market cap – mostly from the dividend.  However, future returns will likely take the form of buybacks that LBTYA will not participate in. As a result, the €500mm is ~25% of the free float of minorities. 
Bottom Line: I believe TNET will likely announce a near-term tender offer upon the expiration of the restricted period (January 18, 2014) at a premium to the current share price. 
4) Solid Revenue/Earnings Growth
I estimate TNET will grow revenues and EBITDA in the +7-10% over the next few years as it leverages its 100% fully-digital cable network vs. incumbent telco provider Belgacom (BELG BB).  Though a MVNO with Mobistar (MOBB BB), TNET’s entry into mobile has also materially accelerated revenue growth and driven market share gains. Though mobile is a relatively lower margin business, the MVNO allows them to retain customers (reduce churn) at a capex-light cost. I expect EBITDA to increase with penetration increases and lower incremental marketing spend. TNET also continues to see analog-to-digital upgrades and penetration increases in broadband and telephony. Similar to the Netherlands, this is a two-player market with TNET in a stable duopoly with Belgacom. Both players are currently pushing through price increases (see below).
Telenet Price Increases
The cable subscription fee was increased to €15.35/month. This increase was made up of:
A new harmonized cable underlying fee of €11.65/month across the whole footprint. Previously, different charges were applied to different geographical regions. Some customers will now pay more, but around two-thirds of customers will actually pay slightly less than before. Overall, this will not be revenue accretive for Telenet on a like-for-like basis
An increase in the monthly contribution for royalties from €3.18 to €3.70. This increase will be passed onto the collecting agencies, so will be EBITDA neutral.
Inflationary (and yearly) price increases of +1.97%. These costs are increased yearly in-line with the ""rising costs of supplying and developing these services"". The following prices remained unchanged: 
All price plans for mobile including King and Kong
All “price per minute” prices and options for fixed telephony.
Overall, these increases imply inflationary increases in headline prices. Since the market continues to increase triple-play penetration, discounts still weigh on the overall product line ARPUs. 
5) TNET: A Great Portfolio Manager’s Stock
With an investment in Telenet, you’ll get an aggressive return of capital and a potential for tender offers at a premium as LBTYA executes its playbook. The remaining minority shareholders are a committed bunch, and in the stock for the long haul – no matter how brief that may be. As a result of the ‘smart’ investor base, the stock itself exhibits very little volatility relative to stocks in the space or to global stock indices, while maintaining  its upside (though a some liquidity sacrifice at €5mm ADV).
6) Other Ways To Win
Price Increases: Given the stability of the Belgium market, I believe we will see pricing leverage from TNET, as well as the rollout of additional high incremental margin products. I have seen this over and over in developed markets.
Mobile: Mobile has provided real upside to revenues and customer, and will ultimately this will flow to EBITDA and FCF growth – I believe we will start seeing these benefits in 2014.
Takeout: With LBTYA owning a 58% controlling interest, a takeout of TNET is a “when, not if” scenario. With TNET and UPC Netherlands owning significant tax assets, LBTYA needs additional assets in order to take advantage of these assets (estimated to be ~€2.5B)…and I believe Ziggo is that asset (28.5% owned by LBTYA). To be clear, I don’t expect TNET shareholders to get much of a control premium, but instead to share in the synergies and tax benefits of Liberty’s consolidation of Europe’s cable.
  RISKS 
1) Competition
An increase in competition from Belgacom would disrupt the Belgian market – though they have never shown any such aggressive behavior and their fixed networks business is still growing, while mobile continues to face pricing pressures. There are no other current competitors in the market. 
The Belgian Regulator recently published the details of the wholesale pricing for cable access in Belgium. Wholesale access will be priced on “retail-minus” basis of 30% (vs. “cost-plus”) for single-play analog TV, or a combo of analog and digital TV. For dual play, it will be priced at a 23% discount (TV and broadband). Per Bloomberg, TNET will challenge the Belgian regulator's decision in a ruling expected early next year. It is likely that wholesaling the network will only become a commercial reality in late 2014/early 2015. Telenet management is confident about wholesaling cable access given there are high barriers to entry: content, relationships, set top box functionality and interface and a legacy TV base that is happy. Even the initial terms came in about as expected, while timing is now likely pushed out. Regardless, I believe the situation is “de-risked” and it is unlikely a competitor enters and makes an impact in the scope of this investment timeframe.
2) Regulatory
Expanding on the above “Competition” risk – now that the regulator has shown their cards, the proposed pricing regime does not seem like it will produce enough margin for new entrants to aggressively compete. Also, given TNET’s appeal and the process it entails – it is unlikely we see a re-seller enter the market until late 2014. I won’t even go into the technology issues that need to be overcome.
  CONCLUSION 
I’ve been involved with the Euro Cable names for over a decade, and have remain confounded at how conservative analysts are with this name. Make no mistake that LBTYA controls TNET, and will be more aggressive versus peers when needed. What this has translated to for investors vs. expectations: higher dividends, more buybacks and more assertive LBTYA ownership. 
TOTAL RETURN PRICE TARGET (6-18 MONTHS): €55 - €66 (+25-50%)
Price Target Components:
Capital Returns: TNET management have indicated they will return 100% of FCF (~€310mm in ’13 growing to ~€350mm in ’14; ~€375mm in ’15), as well as take target leverage up to LBTYA levels, or from 4.0x to 4.5x net leverage (another ~€400mm+). TNET has publicly stated support of €500mm total return over the next few years, but there could be upside of >€700mm per annum while still staying within their leverage guidelines. Given the liquidity in the stock and the recent extraordinary dividend, I believe this will likely be in the form of a tender offer at a premium to the current stock price. A tender offer to the 42% minority holders will further reduce free float. I expect an announcement with the Feb 13, 2014 earnings date.
EBITDA Growth: TNET currently trades at ~10x ’13 EBITDA estimates. Applying a 10x multiple on my 2015 EBITDA estimate of ~€1.0B yields a one-year forward price target of ~€57/share, or ~30% higher than current levels – assuming no re-leveraging, buyback or takeout.

Pitching BOOT as an opportunistic, high-beta short characterized by elevated expectations and fragile sentiment set against fundamentals that appear poised to decelerate in the face of difficult comps and slowing cyclical end markets. BOOT can be characterized as a generally well-run, niche retailer (+MSD-HSD ROIC, mid-teens flowthrough despite +HSD SSS) facing tough comps and peaking unit productivity/margins while trading at the high end of trailing two-year NTM valuation ranges. Sentiment is fragile given perceived niche market opportunity, cyclicality (historical oil & gas proxy; SSS highly correlated to oil & gas employment) and heavy Texas and California exposure (~25% and ~20% of footprint, respectively). Thus, stock's volatile - bottoming at ~$6 in 2017 post oil-price downdraft and -50% to ~$16 in 4Q 2018 before doubling back to current levels. Sell-side ratings dispersion is bullish and 11% short interest down from mid-20s last year prior to 4Q collapse.
BOOT trades at 11x 2019 (Mar20) EBITDA vs trailing two-year NTM range 6-11x (9x avg) and 20x EPS vs 8-21x (14x avg). Recent fundamental momentum and current valuation-insensitive market dynamics should be respected but anything >$35 essentially represents blue-sky valuation and every EBITDA turn is ~$3.50/share. Fair value appears ~$20/share (avg multiples, no-growth existing store base FCF) with price likely to undershoot on any disappointment, macro growth scare or perceived slowing in oil & gas/agricultural economy. 
Catalysts include SSS miss against tough SSS comps, any indications of increasing promo activity on heavy full-price laps and continued evidence of slowing relevant macro data points. Latter includes 1/ decelerating mining/logging employment indicators for TX and US overall (July +3.6% in TX and weakest reading since early-2017 vs 2Q +6.6%; July +2.5% in US vs 2Q +4.0%); 2/ SpendTrend for Workwear/Uniforms +4.7% through mid-August vs +8.1% in July and +2.3% in June; and 3/ weaker U.S. construction employment with July +2.8% vs 2Q +3.2%. Unit growth has also missed in each of last two years (+3% and +6%, respectively) and another shortfall vs guide of +25 (including tuck-ins) vs just a single opening in F1Q could matter.
Primary risk is continued strong fundamental momentum at/above high bar needed to assuage fragile sentiment in the face of slowing macro dynamics and challenging SSS/full-price sales comps. Scarcity also consideration given headwinds plaguing mall-based retailers against current market structure including increasing influence of price-insensitive buyers. Market’s highly fragmented so additional tuck-ins a risk but consensus units +10% this year will almost certainly require additional acquisitions to be met (last month BOOT acquired G&L Clothing, western/workwear store in Des Moines, Iowa and while terms were not disclosed its last nine acquisitions averaged ~$1.2 million/store). Potential as a takeover target appears low.
BOOT is a $1.1B EV omni-channel western/work wear retailer and play on increasing popularity of country music/pickups/rodeos (70% work wear/30% Western). Growth algorithm is +HSD-10% units (50% penetrated), modest leverage on >+2.5-3.0% SSS and e-commerce/private-label penetration, and mid-teens EPS on de-leveraging (1.7x net leverage). Strengths include dominant positioning in highly fragmented niche category with majority of volume typically sold at full price and lower fashion risk than most apparel companies. Mgmt sees path to 10% op margins (vs 8.3% in F19) on sales flowthrough, continued exclusive private-label penetration and e-commerce penetration off low base. BOOT was a 2014 JOBS Act IPO at $16/share with sponsors completely out at May 2018 secondary at $23.50/share.
Recent results have been solid. Clean F1Q beat/raise on broad-based sales strength was enough to best high bar and assuage fragile sentiment for now but not unanticipated w/ stock +90% YTD and trading at high end of historical valuation range. Execution remains solid including notable merchandising, F1Q flow through was better than expected and 2Q bottom-line guide appears conservative (didn't run annual July sale so line of sight on further GM improvement). But this name is all about SSS which did decelerate to +8% F2QTD from estimated +11% in 2H F1Q (+7.5% in 1H of quarter vs F1Q +9.4%). Also expect lagging impact of softening oil/ag indicators to increasingly become visible (downplayed by mgmt on call).
Tariff impact has been relatively modest given pricing power and ability to push back some of the pressure upstream on suppliers. Half of products are imported from China and 25% from Mexico. But BOOT only controls sourcing on the ~20% of mix that is exclusive brands which can be shifted quickly.
Historical share-price correlation with Brent crude diverged beginning in late 2018 and has persisted through 2019 potentially on momentum-driven valuation dynamics or perhaps complacency given stable results of late.

2010-10-20,chewy,JSM,JSM Indochina Ltd.,https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/JSM_Indochina_Ltd./7804069916,71000000.0,0.31,"Description
JSM Indochina Ltd. (""JSM"") is an attractive liquidation with an estimated gross return of 31-45% and because most liquidation proceeds will be returned in <12 months the IRR is >50%.  Importantly, we believe there is no reasonable scenario in which proceeds are below the current price of $0.31/sh.  Our trip to visit all of JSM's properties, discussions with local real estate brokers & lawyers, calls with management, and the June 30, 2010 valuations by Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Land LaSalle gives us comfort that our downside estimate of $0.34/sh, 11% above the current price, is reasonable.
This liquidation is the result of a December 2009 Extraordinary General Meeting (""EGM"") that resulted in Passport Capital LLC (""Passport"") taking control of the Board.  Therefore, the company is solely focused on maximizing proceeds to shareholders - there is no risk that management decides to stop the liquidation or retain proceeds for new projects as Passport owns 13%. 
JSM's pro forma Net Asset Value (""NAV"") of $0.49 consists of $0.18 of cash and $0.31 of real estate in 7 properties in Vietnam and Cambodia.  Our estimate of realized proceeds of $0.40-$0.45/sh includes wind-down costs and write downs to real estate values, but is still 31-45% above the current price. 
Having visited JSM's properties and met with real estate brokers and lawyers in Cambodia and Vietnam, we know there is a fair bit of interest in the properties.  Our best guess is that the current book value of real estate will be realized through the sale process CB Richard Ellis (""CBRE"") began approximately one month ago.  There is further detail on each property in the appendix, but it's important to note that:
(i)                         there is no debt on any of the 7 properties, which eliminates the risk that a slight change in property value has a magnified impact on liquidation proceeds;
(ii)                        the properties are mostly raw land, which is preferred by most buyers to developed properties, but more difficult to precisely value.  Offsetting this, the properties are prime locations (e.g., ~3 acres directly across from the U.S. embassy); and
(iii)                      while global commercial real estate activity is weak, meetings with local brokers revealed multiple bidders for most properties because similar properties do not exist.
The company is committed to quickly returning sale proceeds - we've been told to anticipate a distribution upon each property sale.  Thus far, all dividends have been treated as a return of capital and not taxed - the company anticipates this will be the case for future dividends.  JSM returned 25c in April 2010, 15c in September 2010, and we anticipate an additional 5c (or more) before year-end from a sale closed on Oct 11th.
The liquidation is led by Chairman Scott Verges (""Verges"").  We've spoken with Verges numerous times and he's well suited to manage this liquidation - he has 30+ years of real estate experience, has previously liquidated a $2b real estate portfolio realizing proceeds 20% above book value, and as an appointment of Passport (he is a friend of Passport's General Counsel) is solely focused on maximizing proceeds.  Further, while Verges has made it clear that JSM is not a forced seller, he noted that JSM's large shareholders are ""IRR focused"" and therefore he is working to complete the liquidation as quick as possible.
JSM's market cap is $71mm making this a personal account trade for most VIC members.  The 3 month average daily value traded is just $56k, but we found it fairly easy to buy stock by displaying a bid.  Also, Lehman Brothers International EU (""Lehman"") owns 31.7mm shares - we're a small fund and we bought our position in the open market without contacting Lehman, but they may want to sell.  In the U.S. commissions are generally a fixed amount per share, however, our commission expense has been 50bps of the value of stock purchased, which includes a U.K. stamp tax.
Background
                  JSM went public in London raising $207mm in July 2007 (stock is listed on the AIM and trades in US$).  At the time of the IPO, 6 properties were transferred from CEO/Investment Manager Craig Jones (""Jones"") to JSM in return for ~18% of JSM's stock, worth $38mm, and Jones outlined plans to invest the remaining cash within one year.  However, two years after the IPO, only 3 additional properties had been purchased and JSM's cash balance was $169mm.  This was likely because Jones was annually paid 2% of NAV and was therefore compensated to sit on cash.  Moreover, departures of key personnel raised the ire of Passport, an investor since June 2008, which installed a new Board in December 2009.
  After a comprehensive review of the investment strategy, the reconstituted board terminated the management agreement with Jones and replaced it with a consultancy agreement (detailed later).  Another EGM was held in April 2010 and an orderly realization of the company's portfolio was unanimously approved.  Further, a dividend of $0.25/sh was declared.
  In late September, JSM released 1H 2010 results and announced another dividend of $0.15.  Later in September, the company appointed CBRE to sell the real estate portfolio. 
  Following the October 11th sale of JSM's interest in Hieu Duc Joint Stock Company (""Hieu Duc""), which owned 2 properties, for 98% of book value there are 7 remaining properties:
(i)                         3 standalone Cambodia properties currently being marketed by CBRE (Embassy Centre, Siem Reap, and Ounalom);
(ii)                        2 adjacent Cambodia properties will be marketed by CBRE before year-end upon the completion of construction (Colonial Mansion I & Colonial Mansion II); and
(iii)                      2 Vietnam properties secured by cash pledges are unlikely to be marketed until early 2011 as the company is working with the banks to either extract the cash pledges or sell the underlying properties (Prince and Peninsula).
  Valuation
  Our estimate of liquidation proceeds builds from the 6/30/10 balance sheet, the midpoint of proceeds from the sale of Hieu Duc ($10.3mm was received on 10/11/10 and as much as $2.0mm will be received when a tax matter is resolved, which is expected in the ""coming weeks"" per the press release), $3.6mm of remaining construction expenditures on Colonial Mansion II (this completes all construction), and no taxes on property sales (consistent with conversations with management and JSM filings, including the 2007 Admission Document).  Our 3 scenarios are:
(i)                        Best Guess - assumes $10mm of wind-down expenses and that the current book value of real estate is realized.  We have discussed our expectations of wind-down expenses with the company and been told that $10mm is ""in the ballpark.""  Verges and the other directors of JSM have spent significant time speaking with investment bankers, brokers, and preparing data rooms for JSM's properties and they believe that the current book value of real estate is a reasonable estimate of the proceeds that will be realized from the wind-down.  Following a 5 day trip to Cambodia and Vietnam to  visit every property and meet real estate brokers and lawyers, we also believe that the current book value of real estate will be realized.  We believe that it's possible that the current book value of real estate is exceeded as the 6/30/10 interim report notes ""the fair value of the Group's investment properties at 30 June 2010 has been arrived at by the Directors on the basis of the lower of the valuations carried out at that date by Cushman & Wakefield (Vietnam), Ltd. (""C&W"") and Jones Lang LaSalle Ltd (""JLL"") who are independent valuers that are not related to the Group."" 
(ii)                      Conservative - Wind-down expenses of $12.5mm are 25% above ""Best Guess"" and a 10% haircut is applied to the current book value of real estate. 
(iii)                     Downside - Wind-down expenses of $15.0mm are 50% above ""Best Guess"" and a 25% haircut is applied to the current book value of real estate.

  Cash, cash equivalents, and time deposits
There is minimal FX risk as 96.3% of cash was denominated in U.S. dollars at 12/31/09 (6/30/10 U.S. dollars not reported, but we were told it has not materially changed).
  Wind-down expenses
This includes remaining professional fees of $2.0mm, director fees of $2.0mm, and $1.0mm of staff costs.  The company will pay Jones ~$4.8mm (consultancy agreement of $222k/mth for 15mths = $3.3mm; expense reimbursement of ~$100k/mth for 15 mths = $1.5mm).  Minor items, such as bank charges, bring total wind-down expenses to ~$10.0mm.  Given the low current interest rate environment, we give no credit for interest income on the cash balance. 
  Jones is eligible for a $1.0mm bonus payment, which is at the complete discretion of the board.  In talks with Verges, it has been made clear that unless Jones creates significant value for shareholders he will not receive this bonus - specifically, we were told, ""Craig needs to bring offers to the table well above NAV to receive this bonus.""  Therefore, we do not include it in our estimate of wind-down expenses.
  Estimated timing of dividends
As JSM is currently attempting to sell each property, management does not provide individual property values.  In order to estimate an IRR, we have included our individual property value estimates, which total to the current book value of real estate. 


Property

Estimated Timing  Est Value   Div/sh   Date 
Hieu Duc
 $11.2  $0.05 12/31/10
Embassy Centre  $24.4  $0.11 3/30/11
Prince/Peninsula  $20.9  $0.09 6/30/11
Colonial Mansion I & II  $13.6  $0.06 9/30/11
Ounalom
 $5.3  $0.02 12/31/11
Siem Reap
 $11.7  $0.05 12/31/11
Final Cash Distribution  $16.0  $0.07 4/30/12


IRR 60%

  The above reflects the current book value of real estate.  Using the value estimates in our conservative scenario, the IRR is 41%.  Using the value estimates in our downside scenario, the IRR is 15%.  We assume that the final distribution is made 2 years after the liquidation was begun - we're cautiously optimistic that this will be beat.
  Risks
1.       Timing - Cambodia/Vietnam real estate markets are less liquid than U.S. markets.  We believe we've accounted for this as we assume sales are closed 6-15 months from the time that CBRE was hired.
  2.       Prince - JSM does not currently own either Prince or Peninsula.  Rather, through cash pledges JSM has the right to acquire Prince and/or Peninsula.  JSM owns 80% of New Vision, an entity created to acquire property and build residential apartments.  As part of the arrangement through which the right to acquire Prince was obtained, JSM pledged $12mm to Navibank to secure New Vision's right to acquire the property.  Because of the need to work with its minority partner and Navibank, the manner that Prince will be liquidated is unclear.  Currently JSM is in discussions with its minority partner and Navibank to determine next steps for Prince.  While the company hasn't stated their goal for these discussions, JSM is liquidating so it seems likely that JSM does not want to proceed with the land acquisition and would like its $12mm pledge refunded.  The 6/30/10 interim report includes further details, but it's worth noting that JSM may not be able to come to an agreement with New Vision and Navibank.  We've been given the impression that JSM is attempting to come to an agreement that all parties find acceptable, but because of its 80% ownership, JSM is able to legally exclude its minority partner and work directly with Navibank - if push comes to shove, JSM will do what is in shareholders best interest.  Of the $12mm pledged to Navibank, JSM's maximum exposure is $7.5mm - therefore at least $4.5mm will be refunded to JSM.  While not publicly disclosed, we estimated that JSM is currently holding its investment in Prince at $7.6mm, so a further $3.1mm loss could occur (JSM has written down the value of Prince and Peninsula from $33.0mm to $20.9mm so we assume a 37% write down occurred on both properties). 
  3.       Contingent liabilities - Archetype, a provider of architectural designs, construction management services, and other developer related services, has claimed an amount of $1.0mm against JSM who has responded with a counter suit.  The company has noted that they may hold a small reserve due to this liability and indicated that they do not expect to pay. 
  4.       Country risk - The economies of both Cambodia and Vietnam are rebounding nicely from the economic downturn, but are highly dependent on the health of the global economy (as are most investments).
  Appendix
  Following approval of the liquidation in late April, JSM engaged lawyers and consultants to create data rooms for all properties.  As a result of this, the company has confirmed that it has clear title to all properties.

Johnson and Johnson is the most diversified and respected mega-cap health care company in the United States. It provides services and products for the consumer, pharmaceutical, and medical devices and diagnostics markets globally. With a 2.3% real dividend yield and a 40% payout ratio, J&J is trading at approximately 16x FY2007 earnings estimates of $4.00 per share. The relative valuation of J&J compared to the S&P 500, 10 year Treasury, TIPS, and small-to-midcap US stocks is one of the most compelling in recent history. In addition, the absolute valuation of J&J is the same as it was during the bottom of the bear market in July 2002 when J&J traded at 16x FY2003 earnings. With annual earnings growth of 11% since the early 1900s and annual earnings growth of 15% since the early 1970s, J&J is one of the fastest growing companies in the history of the S&P 500. Sales have not declined since the Great Depression and J&J has raised dividends for 43 consecutive years.
  As one of only six Triple A rated industrial companies in America with a pristine balance sheet, 20%+ Operating Margins, 30% ROE, minimal financial and operational leverage, strong ROCE, low capex needs, and a proven history of profitable acquisitions in addition to showing discipline in capital allocation, J&J presents a low-risk, exciting investment opportunity for investors over the next 3-5 years and more. J&J is likely to perform especially well in a slowing economic environment in the US and experience multiple expansion and decent earnings growth in a base-case scenario.
  This report will argue that J&J’s low valuation is due to several reasons. 1) Mega-cap healthcare companies usually trade in a group. They are very anti-cyclical because their earnings are not cyclical. 2) Merck and Pfizer disappointed investors because of unquantifiable and potentially large liabilities from potentially unsafe blockbuster drugs, and the threat of generic drugs and weak pipelines. Until recently, the weak performance of these two fallen giants cast a dark shadow on most pharmaceutical companies. 3) In a strong economic environment coming out of a recession, the safety, diversity, and durability of J&J’s earnings stream and dividend mattered little to investors. Out of all sectors, stable healthcare and pharmaceutical companies perform the worst during a rocketing economy. 4) Review the July 2006 writeup on GE and the August 2006 writeup on the Consumer Staples ETF for many reasons that are relevant to J&J.
  Company-specific reasons include: 1) Investors believe that J&J is too big to grow at the same rate it has in the past. 2) J&J’s earnings growth of 6% in 2006 is disappointing to investors given J&J has grown earnings in the double-digits every year since 1984. 3) The market is very nervous about J&J’s specific drug pipeline. 4) J&J is perceived to be a large pharmaceutical company and “black-box” in nature. A lot of investors were burned by Merck and Pfizer and do not understand the business profile of J&J, what the risks are, and how the business is changing.
  With clear evidence of housing and commodities slowing, weakness at the consumer level, the inverted yield curve, and the economic expansion into its fifth year, the time is right for J&J to come back into favor among investors as its irresistible combination of stability and solid relative earnings growth will attract investors as it has done in countless number of economic and market cycles—most recently from 1994-1998 when J&J tripled. In the past nine months, Berkshire Hathaway has accumulated stock in J&J. In August, Berkshire filed a request for delayed disclosure with the SEC—a move that in the past has signaled an intention to purchase a sizable holding in a position. This was shown recently with ConocoPhillips and Anheuser Busch.
  Business: J&J is a diverse company with the following business breakdown in order of size.
                                                              Revenue         Operating Profit
Global Pharmaceutical:                             40%                  45%
Medical Devices and Diagnostics             35%                  38%
Organic Consumer Products                    18%                  13%
Pfizer Consumer Products                          7%                    4%
  Total                                                      100%                100%
  US                                                          56%
International                                             44%
    Misconception about J&J: J&J is too big and diverse for investors to have much of an edge analyzing the individual prospects of each business. For more information about the Company, industry, or competitors, please review J&J’s Annual Report and/or sell-side research from the 21 analysts who cover the stock.
  On a company-specific level, the important thing is that J&J is the most diversified large healthcare company that exists. Although many investors know J&J makes Band-Aid and Tylenol and have a favorable image of the company due to its strong brand, a lot of investors do not understand how J&J distinguishes itself from its competitors and why the Company has a lower risk profile than its mega-cap peers Merck or Pfizer.
  Many relative value investors have compared J&J to Merck and Pfizer and come to the conclusion that J&J is not a cheap stock. The logic is that if one values each J&J business based on a sum-of-the-parts analysis, the large percentage of pharmaceutical profits depress the combined multiple significantly. Merck and Pfizer trade for low multiples of earnings of 17x and 13x FY2007 estimates. The obvious question many investors ask is why should J&J trade at a significant premium? Without analyzing whether or not Merck and Pfizer are not cheap stocks, one must understand that Merck and Pfizer have very concentrated pipelines of drugs. For example, Lipitor is now 25% of Pfizer’s sales and a greater percentage of profits. The market obviously knows that Lipitor is going off patent in 2011. In addition to the Vioxx liability, Merck has three different drugs that are 10% of sales or greater including Zocor and Fosamax—both of which are going off patent within the next few years—as well as Cozaar/Hyzaar. On the other hand, J&J does not have any drugs that are greater than 6% of total sales. No customer for J&J constitutes greater than 10% of sales. After Merck spun off Medco in August 2003 and Pfizer recently sold its Consumer Healthcare Products business to J&J in June 2006, both Merck and Pfizer are increasingly pure-play pharmaceutical companies. J&J is clearly a more diversified company that by definition has a lower risk profile. Although there is always a risk of a weaker pipeline than expected, a drug being pulled off the market for health reasons, or other hard to analyze risks for most VIC members, J&J’s superior global reach, lower concentration of products, services, and drugs, as well as a lack of reliance on a few blockbuster drugs make J&J a safer investment. Since it is very unlikely that J&J will suffer a large earnings disappointment due to its diversified businesses, J&J warrants a higher multiple than most of its competitors. Morgan Stanley has published several excellent research reports illustrating the modest weakness of J&J’s pipeline and the necessary steps J&J must take to reach acceptable growth levels.
  Finally, J&J is likely to make further acquisitions going forward after the $16 billion purchase of Pfizer’s Consumer Healthcare Division to further diversify its business and gain additional scale in the US and worldwide. The purchase of well-known brands including Listerine, Sudefed, Ben-Gay, Neosporin, etc. are expected to result in significant synergies for J&J and be accretive to cash earnings within three years. J&J was a loser in the high-profile bidding war for Guidant but demonstrated good discipline when it refused to pay up for the asset. It is likely plenty of rumors will likely surface about J&J being interested in various companies over the next several years including Medtronic and others. J&J’s excellent liquidity position, disciplined capital management, and history of solid integration will allow it to be a successful consolidator in the future.

  The discount to Treasuries is greater than the 1994 period and almost as rich as July 2002 in the midst of the Puerto Rican facility scare at the bottom of the market. Both periods proved to be excellent buying opportunities. Although J&J just reached a new 52-week recently and is more expensive than levels seen earlier in the year, the higher multiple is definitely justified by lower long-term interest rates.
  Many investors believe this time is different and the pharmaceutical industry has changed for the worse. While this is probably true to some extent, J&J always performs poorly on an absolute and relative basis when the economy is overheating. From 1982-1984 and 1992-1994, J&J and most of its peers went nowhere and even declined when the economy was exiting a recession despite cheap valuations and undeniably excellent EPS growth. It is unlikely that J&J will perform as well as it did in the past because of weaker growth and increased industry risks, but it is not unreasonable to expect decent returns going forward given the valuation already incorporates many of the risks investors are concerned about.
  Management Guidance: Management has guided investors to high single-digit revenue growth over the foreseeable future. With modest efficiency gains and stock buybacks, J&J management has guided investors to a 10% earnings growth rate. This growth rate is higher than the 9% growth rate in FY2006 but significantly lower than the 15% growth rate over the past 35 years. Management realizes that the pharmaceutical business has new challenges and risks. However, these estimates are that unreasonable given J&J’s strong execution in the past and decent demographic trends going forward. With a 2.3% dividend yield and management’s estimate of 10% earnings growth, J&J could generate a nominal return of 12% or more. This yield relative to Treasuries at 4.8% and inflation expectations currently around 2.2% over the long-run is quite attractive with the favorable tax environment for equities relative to cash, CDs, and Treasuries.
  Price Target: J&J is currently undervalued based on intrinsic value. The diversity of J&J’s business units and the unparalleled success over all types of economic environments combined with strong free cash flow and high incremental return on invested capital is attractive. If earnings and dividends can grow 8% a year for the next 10 years, which is lower than FY2006 growth, lower than the 15% rate at which J&J grew over the last 30 years, and lower than management’s guidance, then J&J deserves a P/E multiple of 22x forward earnings based on a cost of capital of 6% - 8% and a terminal multiple of 16x. If management’s goals are met, J&J could be valued at a 27x multiple. If J&J continues to grow at 15% annually and surprises investors to the upside by maintaining its growth rate, J&J could be valued at a 37x multiple.
  In three years, J&J should be valued at approximately $103 a share based on analyst estimates of $4.70 in FY2009 after the Pfizer Consumer Healthcare acquisition is integrated. Including dividends, investors could receive a return of approximately 20%-25% per year with very low risk.
                  Adjusted Earnings                 Dividends    
  FY2006:          $3.69                           $1.50
FY2007:          $4.00                           $1.68
FY2008:          $4.35                           $1.86
FY2009:          $4.70                           $2.05
  If J&J has a lousy pipeline and/or more than one material drug treatment is proven unsafe, J&J could miss FY2009 EPS estimates by 15% and earn around $4.00 a share—which is the FY2007 estimate. Given the strong balance sheet and solid history of the company, a worst-case 13x multiple on FY2009 EPS would likely result in a $65 stock price in three years including dividends. However, this multiple and earnings are very unrealistic unless J&J has an unprecedented business disaster or if 10-Year Treasury rates accelerate to levels last seen in the early 1980s.  
  Options: J&J options are a lucrative way of capturing the upside in the stock price because of the low implied volatility due to low interest rates and a tight trading range recently. The price of January 2009 $60 calls is only $10.90 and the $70 calls are only $5.60 on a stock price of $65.20. If J&J’s stock appreciates to $103 by January 2009, the $60 calls and $70 calls would provide upside of 400% and 600%, respectively.
  Risks
  1)      The strength in the economy continues. J&J continues to grow, but experiences multiple contraction or stagnation. Investors prefer riskier equities for longer than we think.
  2)      Interest rates go to 10% or higher and the earnings and dividend yield are not as attractive to TIPS.
  3)      J&J does a poor job allocating capital in the 21st century by overpaying for acquisitions and spending too much money on R&D.
  4)      J&J’s pipeline turns out to be much weaker than expected.
  5)      J&J experiences a product or drug crisis similar to Tylenol in the early 1980s or Vioxx in 2004.

Company Description:
Pentair (PNR), based in Minneapolis, MN, is a diversified manufacturer comprising two operating segments: Water Technologies and Enclosures. The company makes its products from 50 locations in North America, Europe, and Asia.  Pentair dramatically repositioned itself with two moves in 2004: the divestment of its Tools division (sold to Black & Decker for $800 million) and the subsequent $900 million acquisition of WICOR water and pool products.  Growth in the water segment is a primary focus of management.

  Business Segments:
Water Technologies (70% of Revenue).  Pentair’s Water Technologies division makes products for the movement, treatment, storage and enjoyment of water.  Operating margins should be 11% in 2006 and are projected to expand to nearly 15% by 2008 through cost synergies, organic growth, and integration of the WICOR acquisition.  The division is focused on three water markets: pumps (approx. 40% of water sales), pool & spa (30%), and filtration (30%). 
o          Pumps – This area has been growing 2%-4% and is positioned for the following uses: residential and municipal wells, water treatment, wastewater solids handling, pressure boosting, engine cooling, fluid delivery, circulation and transfer.
o          Pool & Spa – This area has been disappointing with expected declines of 3-8% in 2007 from residential exposure, but is poised for good long term growth of 5-8% thereafter. This segment provides a complete line of pool/spa equipment, including: pumps, filters, heaters, lights, controls, cleaners, and other equipment.  Approximately 40% of pool & spa revenues are generated from Pool Corp (ticker: POOL).
o          Filtration – The filtration segment is growing low to mid single digits.  This market is addressed with control valves, filtration components, tanks, pressure valves and other items used for filtration, deionization, and desalination systems, and industrial and residential water filtration applications.
  Enclosures Business (30% of Revenue).  The Enclosures group manufactures enclosures (essentially specialized boxes) that protect sensitive controls, components, and accessories.  Operating margins are 15%, with room for modest expansion thereafter.  This group focuses its business on four primary industries: Commercial & Industrial (35% of segment), Telecom and Datacom (35%), Electronics (25%), and Networking (5%).  Products include metallic and composite enclosures, cabinets, cases, subracks, backplanes, and thermal management systems.  This division was augmented by the $120 million acquisition of APW in 2005.
  Thesis:
-         Opportunity for Continued Cost Synergies, Margin Expansion.   One of the company’s strengths is its ability to apply lean efficiency methods to its manufacturing processes.  The company is in the early stages of this process for its water business.  PNR also incurred a variety of expenses in 2006 which will not recur in 2007, including plant moves/closures (roughly $15m), pump JV losses ($4m), spa division losses ($5m), and overseas start up costs ($10m+).    
-         Acquisition Target.  Pentair’s valuation and position with several leading brands in the water industry could make it a potential sale candidate.    Several larger players that would be interested in Pentair, include Danaher, ITT Industries, Siemens, Cooper or a private equity firm.  Eight of ten Board members are independent so I believe management is on a short leash to improve recent weak execution. Management does have a dilutive poison pill that makes a hostile offer less likely.  Recent comps of private equity interest in the water space include Jacuzzi bought by Apollo and Water Pik bought by Carlyle Group.  Both were done in the 9-10x Ebitda range for lower quality assets. 
-         New management.  Pentair recently appointed Mike Schrock - a noted cost-cutter/efficiency guy - as COO.  Schrock previously ran the enclosures business, which saw EBIT margins increase from 2% to 15% over the last 3-4 years.  The company also announced corporate/field headcount reduction and removed other layers of management to clearly create more accountability in the organization.  I believe this focus will be key for raising water margins to 15% in two years.
-         Cheap valuation and good risk/reward.  PNR trades at 14.1x 2007 earnings, 13.1x 2007 FCF, and 11.9x 07 FCF ex-growth capex (8.5% yield).  Other industry participants such as Mueller, ITT, Flowserve and Pall trade at an average of 18.4x forward EPS.  Pentair announced its largest buyback ever at $100m, and bought roughly $45m in the third quarter alone.  I think the stock is worth $44 in a year, based on 16.5x 08 EPS of $2.67, which assumes 15% margins for the water business.  That’s 42% of upside, while I think downside is limited to $28 (-9%) based on a 15x multiple of 07 EPS of $2.00 which assumes only 100 bps of margin expansion in the water business in 2007.    
-         Good Long-term Growth Outlook of Water Industry.  The growth outlook for the water industry is solid, with projected annual increases of 2%-5% for pumps, 5%-8% for pool & spa, and 8%-plus for more-proprietary filtration systems.  Pentair is widely recognized as the leader in pumps and pool/spa products, and is focused on bolstering its position in filtration.  Moreover, the company is focused on expanding its presence in the higher-growth international markets.
  Key Risks:
-         Recent performance.  Operational consistency has been lacking since the Company purchased WICOR.  Basically, this purchase has been more difficult than anticipated, resulting in higher costs and some lost revenue.  As a result, the stock is clearly cheap and should move more to a peer valuation once execution improves and investors regain confidence.
-         Ties to Real Estate Cycle.  Pentair’s product lines have some exposure to the housing cycle, which is at peak levels.  Pool/spa has the greatest exposure at close to 50% new pools, while filtration/pumps are 80-90% commercial or replacement.  With the recent Q3 pre-announcement, management lowered the bar with pool/spa sales declining by double digit percentages in Q4 as channel inventory levels get worked down.  The Company has set pool/spa targets at -3% to -8% in 2007, while its biggest customer (Pool Corp) is looking for 3-5% growth.
-         Acquisition Integration.  The company will use some free cash flow to pursue acquisition targets, such that there is risk that management will overpay or face difficulties with integration efforts.  Difficulties at WICOR have made the company reassess its acquisition plans, hence the higher share repurchases lately.  Most of WICOR integration challenges should be complete by year end.

Thesis: Viad is a combination of two excellent, high compounding, but very different businesses, with a near term opportunity to separate/sell one of them. The current valuation only values one, providing for a 100%+ upside within a few years and a low (-25%), margin of safety backed, downside.
Business Description (via CapIQ)
Viad Corp operates as an experiential services company in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, continental Europe, and the United Arab Emirates. It operates in two business groups, GES and Pursuit. The company offers event planning and production, look and feel design, layout and floor plan designs, furnishings and carpet, show traffic analysis, marketing and strategy, electrical distribution, cleaning, plumbing, overhead and booth rigging, and material handling services; and signage products and common area structures. It also provides creative design and strategy, integrated marketing and pre/post event communications, data analytics and insights, event surveys, return on investment analysis, online management tools, attendee/exhibit booth traffic analysis, staff training, logistics/transportation, storage/refurbishment of exhibits, installation and dismantling labor, and tradeshow program management services. In addition, the company offers custom exhibit design/construction, portable/modular exhibits and design, and graphics and signage products; event technology services, including event accommodation solutions, registration and data analytics, and event management tools; and audio-visual services, such as video and lighting production, digital studio, entertainment and talent coordination, projection mapping, and computer rental and support services.
Further, it owns and operates hotels and lodges, recreational attractions, food and beverage, and retail facilities; provides ground transportation services comprising sightseeing tour, airport shuttle, and seasonal charter motor coach services, as well as offers corporate and event management services for meetings, conferences, incentive travel, sports, and special events. The company was founded in 1914 and is headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona.
Couple of notes before we get going:
-        -The GES business is very steady but as it hosts some big conferences some of them happen only every two or three years showing misleading bumps in the road. For example 2018-2019 are off show years, while 2020 is expected to be a huge year with most of the conferences hitting that year. So business is steady, revenues are now. Its best to look at that business on a 2 year stack basis.
-        -In the past, and per management’s direction, I always assumed the Pursuit business would be spun off but I actually believe now it might be GES and Pursuit will stay as the much better business
-    - The company is very granular and for a change I'd recommend checking out their presentation to see assets/more detail than I provide here
HiHistory of Viad/Background
  As background, Viad was one of the last conglomerates from the 80s/90s where they owned things like Greyhound, Dial, Moneygram, etc which they’ve actively spun out or sold over the years. In the end, Viad was left with GES and Pursuit, two very different businesses which they’ve committed to separating when Pursuit reaches about $250mm in revenues. Despite being a $1b+ company, its low deal flow and mostly self funding growth has the company with only two (I think) sell side analysts covering it, and on the industrials side when half of its profits now comes from lodging and attractions meaning the coverage doesn’t really understand the true value of the two businesses. The company is very granular about its results, guidance and acquisitions on a per segment, per country, organic/acquired/same show basis which over the years I’ve found to have built up a lot of credibility with the management team.
Segment Descriptions
GES: GES is a global, full-service live events company offering a comprehensive range of services to the world’s leading brands and event organizers.
It has 30% share in the US, 55% share in the UK and 45% share in Canada. 3 of the top 5 global event organizers use GES as do 14 of the top 25.  Downside is despite 24% market share in exhibitions ($2.6b market), it has low penetration in higher margin Corporate Events (3% share in $3.4b market) and Conferences (14% in $1.8b market). Most contracts are 3 to 5 years and have a 90%+ renewal rate across a very diversified array of industries and customers.
All known U.S. competitors and most international competitors are privately held companies that provide limited public information regarding their operations. The primary competitor for GES within its Core Services is The Freeman Company (a privately held, U.S. headquartered company); however, there is competition from a large number of service providers in the other categories of service offerings.  Freeman is bigger, in that it has 7,000 employees to GES’s 3,000 and about $2.3b in revenues (per Hoover’s), however that is very limited information. On a revenue per employee basis (in 2017 when was the last time I looked or wrote about this) of about $350,000 for both this seems to bear out. Freeman has about 2,000 employees internationally so it seems to be more of a domestic competitor to GES given GES’s low 30% market share domestically. From what I understand via channel checks/due diligence with customers, at the size of events that these guys host, its less about price sensitivity, and more about reliability, experience and capital which create a barrier to entry which is not insurmountable but significant enough to prevent serious competition from coming in. The stable market share and retention rate numbers published by Viad over the years seem to bear out the oligopoly thesis in the key markets.
Results:
Revenues: 2019: $1150mm 2018: $1,111mm 2017: $1,133mm; 2016: $1,056mm; 2015: $978mm, 2014: $958mm
Same Show Growth: 2019: 3% 2018: 2.8% 2017: 4.8% 2016: 4.1%; 2015: 8%, 2014: 6.4% 2013: 3.1%, 2012: 6.5%
EBITDA: 2019: $80mm 2018: $77mm 2017: $88mm; 2016: $80.4mm; 2015: $54.8mm; 2014: $54.9mm
EBITDA margin: 2019: 7% 2018: 6.9% 2017: 7.8%; 2016: 7.6%; 2015: 5.6%; 2014: 5.8%
ROA (OI/Avg Segment Assets): 2018: 7.8% 2017: 10% 2016: 11.1%, 2015: 7.2%; 2014: 7.9% (Cap Ex is about $30mm or 3% of revenues on average)
*lower revenues in 2018-2019 are due to negative show rotation which is expected to bounce to $100mm in revenues in 2020 with strong flow through to the bottom line which I approximate to be over 30%.
In the last few years GES has tried to get more into event services such as audio visual and event logistics and has made a number of acquisitions which have higher margins (27%) and ROICs than GES’s current business, which explains the rise in both.  The last 4 acquisitions cost $113mm, provided $20mm in EBITDA (15% EBITDA margin) in 2018 (implied multiple 5.6x) and provide 17% IRR (per company 2018 presentation and excludes a recent acquisition of ON Services).
Final Points of GES
• Solid and consistent mid to high single digit grower, with over $1.1b in high recurring revenues and low average double digit ROICs. Somewhat capital intensive (about $518mm in assets in 2018) and economically sensitive, though no indication per management, of any slow down with at least a 12-month lead time.
• Will likely continue to grow in mid to high single digits, with more opportunities for margin expansion via providing higher margin services. I believe the recent acquisitions position GES better to move into more lucrative corporate segments.
• FCF conversion is about 3.5% to 4% of revenues
• Short term expectations: 2020: $1.25b in revenue and $100mm to $110mm in EBITDA, $75mm in FCF
• Likely near term valuation multiples at forward 8x to 10x EBITDA or $800mm to $1,100mm and $1250mm on 2021 ($40 to $62 per share). No real comps other than its own purchases, but consistent FCF generation lends to $70mm growing at 4-5% CAGR with 8-10% cost of capital will get you the same valuation numbers via a DCF without needing heroic assumptions. 
Per my conversation with management which I tend to have a couple of times a year, and THIS IS JUST A GUT FEELING NOT INSIDER INFO, I believe that this is probably the segment that is likely for sale. I use to think it was Pursuit, but I got the sense they would rather keep Pursuit and sell of GES going forward and I know a few i-bankers have been circling.
Pursuit : Pursuit is comprised of attractions, hospitality, transportation and travel planning services that work together, driving economies of scope in iconic destinations of Vancouver, Banff, Jasper, Glacier, Waterton Lakes, Denali and Kenai Fjords National Parks in US and Canada.
 Personal Note: I really love this business. Having owned a few hotel REITs in the past (and we’ll get into valuation more later) I think this is a cream of the crop business and could be a good REIT or MLP candidate. The hotels (lodges) are in stable, and less-than-metropolitan-areas-economically-sensitive-environments (a mouthful).  National park travel has been on the rise (http://www.latimes.com/travel/la-tr-nps-crowds-20170228-story.html) and is a cheaper and more fun alternative than going on more expensive vacations. I’d venture to say this business could actually do better in a recession as people opt for cheaper vacation packages (but this is conjecture). The attractions (and more on those in a bit) are an excellent, high ROIC, natural monopoly businesses and create a higher margin tailwind for Pursuit relative to other hotel REITs. Attractions and Lodging account for 80% of revenue mix and are a higher margin business segment, with lower margin Transportation and Package Tours (20% of revenue mix) being de-emphasized going forward. I believe the correct way to look at this business segment is a standalone which it should become in the next 18-24 months when it would reach $250mm in revenues. I use to place a lot of weight in the REIT conversion thesis, however, with tax reform/some Canadian asset issues I no longer consider this the most efficient route. On the other hand, with comps still trading at high mid teens EBITDA multiples its not really as important.
A)     Lodging – Solid business. Mostly seasonal. Mount Royal Hotel had a fire in 2017 which put it out of commission until late 2018. The new version rebuilt and upgraded with insurance proceeds looks amazing, with 30% increase in EBITDA. Companywide RevPAR is growing well ($129 vs $124 2018 to 2017), and its not out of hand expensive, relative to other hotel REITs. The properties are located in somewhat constrained areas in small towns. Competitive dynamics are such that, while possible to build new properties, its likely that on the ground players like Pursuit, will have first mover advantage if they see the demand picking up.
B)     Attractions – I think this is the key differentiator for Pursuit as a justification for higher premium valuation. They are higher margin, recurring revenue businesses with opportunities to deploy capital toward high ROIC improvement projects as recent Glacier Skywalk and Banff Gondola projects have shown. The company has shown consistent passenger and Revenue Per Passenger growth though I would imagine these are more consumer/economically sensitive properties.
Recent examples of two successful attraction projects, are the opening of the Glacier Skywalk ($20mm in investment into $6.5mm of annual EBITDA) and Banff Gondola revamp ($22mm investment into a$9.5mm), per company presentation.
The biggest “hidden asset” the company has is the FlyOver brand. Having been on the ride in Mall Of America (they don’t own that one but it shows their FlyOver Canada film) it’s a great 15-20 minute experience. It’s a giant seat plank hanging over a 3-4 story sized screen showing a helicopter style ride through national attractions, with occasional mist thrown in for effect. Its incredibly popular and they’ve acquired FlyOver Vancouver in 2016. Since then they’ve expanded into Iceland and LasVegas as organic growth projects. The beauty of it is, the more locations you have the more shows you can show i.e. I can do FlyOver Iceland and Canada on the LasVegas strip. There are many international and domestic locations available. These are not very capital intensive assets which should be under $5mm-$10mm cap ex (the filming is surprisingly expensive) but I believe in high volume areas like the LV strip can generate high double digit IRRs.
        Additionally, the company is an active acquirer in the space for both lodging and attractions. The company made 11 acquisitions between 2014 and 2018 that cost $335mm that provide $41mm in EBITDA (implied price 8.2x) and provide 19% IRR (per company presentation).  The company’s hurdle rate is a 15% and is always evaluated against re-purchasing shares and they usually pay 7x to 10x EBITDA multiple, depending on cross selling opportunities.

Final Points of Pursuit
• Great business with great assets. High margins and returns, lots of opportunities for organic and acquisition based growth.
• As a standalone, income generating asset, currently has an inefficient capital structure with value created through a potential recapitalization (sale, spin off, internally with a special dividend) either via Viad or a Private Equity acquirer.
• Solid Free Cash Generation/ROICs of this business as well as lack of leverage within the current structure should command a premium relative to the current hotel comp set (more in valuation).
• Short term expectations: 2020: $250mm in revenue and $100mm in EBITDA with $65mm in FCF
Management
I’ve really enjoyed owning this company in the hands of Steve Moser. He has doubled the EBITDA and stock price, grew ROIC, and made some shrewd acquisitions.  This has been a “beat and raise” (guidance) management, very granular and transparent about expectations. Management long term compensation is based on Total Shareholder Return (ROIC, EBITDA and Relative TSR) and short term compensation is based on mostly Operating Income and Operating Margin.
 •   The CEO compensation of $3mm to $4mm a year for a $1.2b market company is probably ok and Steve Moster deserved it. He is probably one of my favorite CEOs in my investment experience
•  The board has separated the CEO and Chairman role, a rare but welcome step
•  Mr. Moster owns $5mm of stock, a significant amount, more than than his annual salary which is about $1.5mm higher than two years ago, and management and board as total, own about $27mm.  Notably the CFO, Ellen Ingersoll, owns almost $10mm worth of stock.
•  The stock is owned primarily by institutional investors (90%), with a little too much index fund concentration (Black Rock at 15% and Vanguard at 6.1% and DFA at 8.0%) but also significant 5%+ holdings by GMT and Moab Capital Partners at 7.4%. Moab has been in it longer than I have (4 years).
Capital Structure
At the current share price of $61.5 and 20.3mm shares outstanding the company’s market capitalization is $1,230mm.  The company has $312mm in debt, and $44mm in cash for ~$270mm in Net Debt and $1,500 in Enterprise Value. Relative to an expected $160mm in EBITDA in 2019, the debt levels are below 1.7x of EBITDA and 18% of total enterprise value. 
The company has a $450mm revolving credit facility which can be increased an addition $250mm under certain circumstances. Additionally, it has a $44mm revolving credit facility specifically tied to Brewster Assets under Pursuit. The rate paid is tied to LIBOR and is approximately 3%. Currently the company has about $180mm ($430) in maximum borrowing capacity available under the current credit agreements and ~$33mm in cash for additional “dry powder” capacity of $460mm.  The company is in compliance of all covenants. Finally, the company has a small ~27mm pension obligation which does not seem constraining.
Valuation – Price Target: $120
Since these are two pretty different businesses that will eventually be separated I believe it makes sense to value them as stand-alone businesses on a Sum Of The Parts basis.  Additionally, I think looking at them 2 years from now would also makes sense using various scenarios at approximately 2021 or on a forward looking basis two years from now.  The valuation thesis is predicated on Viad eventually selling one of the two businesses, which I now believe will be GES.
Key Takeaways
•   Downside Case Price Target of $45 (7x 2021 of $160mm), Base Case Price Target of $120 (12x 2021 of $220mm), Best Case Price Target of $170 (14x 2021 $250mm EBITDA)
•  Downside is approximately down 25% in a recessionary scenario. I believe the quality of the assets, international diversification, low leverage and attractiveness to financial sponsor institutions keeps the valuation above 6.0x EBITDA. The recent sell off in 2018 kept the stock in the 40s.
•   Base case return is 100% from today’s price, making VVI a compelling 4-1 risk reward ratio.
•   Best Case is almost a 190% return from today, a possible though maybe not highly probable scenario
•   Even today’s fair value of $90.00 is 50% above today’s stock price.
Notes
•   GES is difficult to value given lack of comps. However, given oligopolistic position, high renewal rates, recurring nature of revenues, double digit ROICs and at least mid to high single digit growth rates EBITDA multiples in the 8.0x range are not wildly optimistic. My 2021 Free Cash Flow estimate of $80mm with a 10% cost of capital and 3% terminal growth rate would get you a conservative $1.15b Terminal Value valuation (7% Free Cash Flow yield).
•  I am not including a corporate expense here. Its approximately $10mm a year and a lot of it is non-cash equity compensation.  The rest of the corporate expenses seem to be allocated between the two segments.
•  Pursuit comps can be broken down into two parts: Attractions and Hotel REITs, though both have similar trading multiples of 10x-14x. It should be noted that Pursuit’s EBITDA margins of high 30s are significantly above most of the industry low 30s in addition to stronger growth prospects. I am using 13x which is close to Vail who may be a natural acquirer of this business.
•    Additionally, Pursuit is unlevered.  My 2021 EV Estimate for Pursuit of $1,450 is an equity valuation. A shrewd financial player can certainly lever it up and pay out a special dividend, making this an attractive play for financial sponsor type institutions.
Risks:
•   This is based on an eventual separation of the two businesses so that value can be recognized In this case the EBITDA multiples are likely to be in higher single digits than the 12-15x multiples used here.
•   Both business segments are in somewhat economically and consumer sensitive areas. A prolonged downturn can really impact results, more so than my implied bear case scenario.
•  Given the acquisitive nature of VIad’s management acquisition integration, such as the recent difficulty with ON Services, can impact the results.
•  My conclusions are probably not the same as yours. This is what makes a market.
   I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

Management is essentially liquidating the company—now is the time. At $21 per share, AT&T is cheap, possesses identifiable catalysts to drive stock price appreciation and has limited downside risk at current prices. The risk/reward is now finally in our favor. Specifically, we now have a better understanding of the debt allocation, post break-up. In summary, there are two value creation phases to this story—the restructuring value phase adds $10 per share and the operational improvement value phase adds another $5 to $7 per share. Management can achieve the two simultaneously, but I doubt it. So I focus on these two separately. Our downside risk is a potential decrease of $4 of value per share on a temporary basis as I expect index funds to sell shares of AT&T due to the expected change in the company’s index weighting. (There seems to be no other clear, fundamental reasons that are on the horizon that is not priced in the stock).

On May 11, AT&T filed its proxy regarding the restructuring plan to break the company up into 4 pieces. Without boring you with the details, I’ll get to the point: Business & Consumer Services are bad businesses but generates lots of cash. I really don’t care what they are worth, as long as they can take on some of the parent’s debt (about half). AT&T Wireless (AWE) is not a “cash flow-type” company—so I can’t get to its fair, intrinsic value. I’ll take a risk and use AWE’s market value as a measure of the company’s current worth. (You can email me later about these decisions.) At the end of the day you are buying a cable business. Here is what is important: Broadband is a good business in an industry that is becoming more and more favorable. The broadband segment is essentially the business combinations of Media One and TCI. Top line growth will come from price increases from digital cable not unit growth. That’s ok. As in the past, AT&T can raise prices given the nature of the business. Top line growth will come from added services as customers shift to digital cable. Cost cutting in this business is critical. The economics of the business signifies that the company has significant opportunities to improve profitability. (Having lower margins than other industry participants in a commodity-like business, while having no “real” competition in your local markets is an opportunity). AT&T Broadband has real and sustainable competitive advantages as well. The company’s competitive advantage is based on technological and scale economies. The company’s level of scale will allow the company to defend its market from over-builders (like RCN). Technologically, the company has an advantage over substitute products (such as Direct-TV) because these products have limited technology. For example, two-way communication is not possible with the Direct-TV model and direct marketing (i.e., home, neighborhood-specific marketing) will be very difficult to implement. Therefore, competition from satellite providers is not a strong threat. As a result, the company will gain market share from competitors such as Direct-TV because their current advantage over cable is not sustainable over time. A few years ago, customers flocked to satellite providers. As a result, new entrants as a group saw their customer list grow to 15 million in the past six years. Why were customers excited? The value-added proposition was clear: more channels for the same price. For example, while Direct-TV customers pay relatively similar rates as do cable customers, they have access to 400 to 500 channels vs. the 60 to 80 channels that analog cable customers receive. With digital cable, customers will have a similar number of channels and thereby eliminating Direct-TV’s advantage. The only (perceived or real) advantage industry participants such as Direct-TV and Echostar might have over cable is better content, but that’s debatable. All told, AT&T Broadband is a good business in a favorable industry because a) the assets are hard to replicate creating high barriers to entry; b) digital cable (growing at double-digit rate, with better margins) offers a higher average revenue per user due to increased channel capacity; and c) although CapX may remain high—despite what some on wall street think—it should not be enough to destroy more than $1 to $2 of value per share, by my calculations. As for what I believe to be a potential upside, (some may think this is a negative) the company has not performed very well operationally (for example, AT&T’s margins should be much higher given the company’s scale) and also the company’s migration to digital service is slower than its peers and what management expected. I believe these negatives stem from legacy issues from the old TCI operations. That’s ok for now, since we are in the “restructuring value” phase and that the company would have to shutdown operations to loose significant market share.


As for valuation, in aggregate, AT&T is currently trading at less than 6.5 x EV/EBITDA. If you back out three of the business segments to isolate broadband, you are paying about 7x for that business, post restructuring on low EBITDA due to poor operations. How good can operations get? I don’t know. But if you assume broadband can get to about 85% of comparable margins, you will own broadband at 6x EV/EBITDA. The private equity firms that I contacted indicated that less that 7x is a good price to pay for cable operations—buy at 7x and exit at 12 to 14x. The current valuation of 6x does not including the premium one would pay for the AT&T market strength, brand and reach. On a comparable analysis basis, cable companies are trading at 16x to18x EV/EBITDA. In the final analysis, broadband, wireless and business/consumer services are worth about $30 (based on EV/EBITDA: broadband—15x on ~$2.5bn; wireless @ $19 per share; business services—5x on ~$9bn; consumer services—2x on ~$5bn). Including margin improvements in broadband, the valuation yields to a $37 stock price. As for my downside protection, at $17 per share, both consumer and business services would be free.

In conclusion, your upside is +76% while and your downside is 19% in 18 months.
Catalyst
1) Aggressive deleveraging: AT&T’s debt reduction is on schedule. To mention a few, they sold cable systems to Mediacom for $2.2bn (pretax) in cash; sold Japan Telecom stake for ~ $1.4bn in cash proceeds—after-tax proceed are expected to be in the neighborhood of $1bn which will be share evenly between AT&T and AWE; sold a few cable systems to Charter Communications for $1.8bn; recently requested that the entire stake of approximately 25.55% in Time Warner Entertainment be designated for registration with the SEC; the company is also evaluating on its options in regards to its 49 million shares of Cablevision Systems. On April 5, 2001, AT&T requested that Cablevision register 30 million shares of this stock with the SEC; AT&T plans to complete an equity carve-out of AT&T Broadband in the fall. Et cetera…

2) The completion of the breaking up.

3) Operational improvements: A focus on the operations of the company is the most potent catalyst to drive AT&T’s share price appreciation. I believe if current management is unable to get the operations up to par, new managers will be installed—the current management is already on a short leash.

4) Lower interest rates: Historically, cable companies tended to perform well when the Fed lowers interest rates. In fact, if you go back 12 years from 1988 to the 2000 and graph cable companies in relation to the move in interest rates, the relationship is quite encouraging.",8.772075919361246,-1.6977710371546095,-7.493514632994444,-5.622950078976942,-4.614387058819275,-10.456240855747149,-14.084971654709886,-26.705474935229685
2021-08-24,crestone,SU,SUNCOR ENERGY INC,https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/SUNCOR_ENERGY_INC/9121008200,34530000000.0,23.16,"Description
Suncor is the largest integrated energy producer in Canada. 

The stock offers over 100% upside to fair value today, assuming WTI oil prices of $55. It has excellent downside protection, with a fully-loaded cash flow breakeven at $35 WTI, and a robust balance sheet that allows it to weather extreme volatility, such as what occurred in 2020 due to COVID-19. It trades at only 6x FCF, and FCF is expected to grow 20% by 2025, with no increases in production.

Market FUD over peak oil, battery electric vehicles, and COVID-19’s impact on the global economy has created an opportunity to buy a resilient, diversified business that can make money in an extremely wide range of energy price environments.

Background:

Suncor’s core business is extracting oil from its oil sands resources in northeast Alberta, where it has 30+ years of resources in the Athabasca oil sands, one of the largest resources in the world. It complements this with a refining operation that refines its own crude into finished fuels and petroleum products for North American markets, a retail marketing operation that sells fuels directly to customers at 1,700 gas stations in Canada and the US, a smaller offshore oil and gas operation, and interests in a variety of wind and other renewable energy projects. 
  The integrated business model -- Suncor calls it “from ground to gas station” -- smooths operational volatility, as refining and marketing can offset maintenance stoppages in the oil sands business, and allows the company to maximize profits through tight coordination and ownership of the entire value chain. Because of this integration, Suncor’s refining operations earn 2x the EBITDA per barrel as the company’s closest peer.
  Suncor’s core oil sands business has essentially no exploration risk, and is more like a manufacturing business than a traditional E&P company. Extracting crude from the company’s oil sands resources is a straightforward process using “in situ” methods like steam-assisted gravity drainage, or open mining where the sands are close to the surface. These oil sands operations have near-zero decline rates (in contrast with the industry, and especially with shale which declines very rapidly), and low cash costs which have been steadily declining for years, making underwriting of the business far simpler than it is for the company’s more exploration-dependent peers in the oil and gas business. Today, the cash operating costs of the core oil sands business are ~$27/barrel, and for the whole company, $30/barrel, including sustaining capex. After including the dividend, the breakeven is $35/barrel, and the company targets reducing this to $30/barrel by 2025. 
 
With such a low breakeven cost of oil, the company has substantial downside protection for a wide variety of oil price scenarios.

The Macro:

While I’m not a macro investor, it’s hard to invest in an oil company without some consideration for the common bear cases for the fossil fuel industry, from the growth in battery-electric vehicles to the potential for carbon taxes.

Here is how I got comfortable investing in a company that is so tied to fossil fuel prices.

Battery-electric vehicle threat is smaller than it appears
BEV penetration is growing rapidly but is still very small. It hit 2.5% of all light electric vehicle sales in 2019 according to McKinsey. But it’s the percentage of total stock that counts for oil consumption, and in 2020, that had only grown to 1% of the total global car parc. Morgan Stanley estimates that by 2030, 30% of cars produced will be BEVs, but since cars have an average lifetime of 10-12 years, even 30% annual penetration replaces just 3% of the global fleet each year. Even with rapid growth in BEVs it will be many years before they replace enough of the global fleet to make a material dent in oil used for transportation.

Oil isn’t used just for transportation
About two thirds of oil is used for transport, but the other third is used for a multitude of other purposes, for which there is no great substitute. If you look around, from your fleece vest to your running shoes to your widescreen monitor to the interior and bumpers of your car, there are oil-based products all around. To replace all of these plastics and other petroleum-based products with another feedstock at mass scale anytime soon is improbable. This pre-pandemic set of estimates from McKinsey shows growth in share for non-transportation uses offsetting slowing growth from transportation through 2030.
https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/oil-and-gas/our-insights/petroleum-blog/5-key-signposts-that-will-set-the-cost-of-the-marginal-barrel-of-oil-in-the-long-term 



Oil demand is still expected to grow slowly through the 2030s 
As a result of 1) and 2) and other factors, oil demand is still expected to grow over this decade before plateauing over the next.
https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2020/outlook-for-fuel-supply 
    Investment in new oil production has fallen dramatically
Even as oil demand is expected to keep growing slowly or be stable for years to come, investment in new oil production has plummeted over the last several years. Oil is a commodity which requires regular replacement, with about 5% natural depletion each year. If demand grows 1-2%, and production naturally declines 5%, the industry needs to replace 6-7% a year with new investment. Projected capex for 2021 is down 56% from its peak in 2013, while demand for oil has grown 5%, according to estimates for 2021. By next year, when demand is expected to return to pre-pandemic levels, demand will be up 8% from 2013. 
https://www.naturalgasintel.com/u-s-eps-reining-in-capex-while-international-operators-spending-more/ 
This lack of investment will catch up to the market, and drive oil prices which justify re-investment. That means that prices should normalize around the marginal cost of production, which is widely considered to be in the $50-60 range. https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/oil-and-gas/our-insights/global-oil-supply-and-demand-outlook-to-2040 

Carbon taxes will not change the outcome
While global or national carbon taxes would impact demand somewhat, the impact should be felt by the highest cost producers the most, rather than a company like Suncor that operates far below the marginal cost. Suncor already expects carbon taxes of $170/tonne in Canada by 2030, and has estimated that this will add $0.46 in cost to each barrel of oil they produce -- i.e., a 1-2% tax on their cash margins. This would not have a material impact on the upside to fair value in the stock, and this is before any potential offsets, as Suncor is actively investing in growing its renewable fuels production capacity and in carbon capture and sequestration technologies which could make the company a recipient of tax credits. Rather than resisting carbon taxes, Suncor is actively lobbying in favor of broad-based carbon pricing.

Valuation provides a margin of safety
Suncor’s deep discount to intrinsic value provides a substantial margin of safety should I be wrong on any of the above factors. With a cash cost breakeven at $35 and declining, and the company trading at 5.5x FCF and returning most of its cash flow to investors, oil demand and oil prices can be a lot lower, and carbon taxes can come a lot sooner, and I still won’t lose money.

Current Opportunity:

Over the last five years, Suncor was focused on production growth, and increased its net production from 600 to 800kbpd. For the next five years, Suncor has prioritized “value over volume,” committing to hold production stable even if oil prices climb substantially, and seeking to maximize its asset utilization and margins. With planned capex limited to maintenance, de-bottlenecking, and other efficiency and technology projects, free cash flow (which the company calls free funds flow) is expected to climb significantly. This is what makes the company so attractive right now.

Suncor is expected to generate about C$10 bn in operating cash flow (FFO) this year, and $6 bn in free cash flow, so today it’s trading at a 17% FCF yield, or ~6x 2021 FCF.

From 2021 through 2025, the company plans to grow its annual FFO and FCF by C$2 bn (about 20%) from a variety of cost savings, asset optimization, and technology initiatives. Over the five year period, it expects to cumulatively generate about $53 bn in FFO at $55 WTI, and plans to return approximately 60% to shareholders through dividends, share buybacks, and debt reduction. This equals ~90% of the current share price! 

See this chart from the company’s May investor day:

  So within five years, an investor will receive back nearly all he or she paid if the company hits its targets!

With the company focusing on lower risk maintenance capex and efficiency initiatives rather than production growth, I have reasonable confidence in the company achieving these targets.

Valuation:

To estimate fair value, I assume a long-term oil price of US$55, which appears to be the consensus on the marginal cost of production and where I believe long-term oil prices should normalize. With oil prices at $65 today, this gives some cushion in the model.

I assume the company gets most but not all of its targeted increase in FFO over the next 5 years, resulting in approximately C$11.8 bn FFO in 2025. I assume that capex is roughly C$5 bn, in-line with the company’s guidance. This results in FCF growing about 16% from ‘21 through ‘25, somewhat more conservative than the company’s targets. Assuming the company uses about ⅓ of its cash flow for buybacks results in a share count reduction of about 16% over that period, and FCF/share growth of ~40%, from my estimate of about C$4/share this year, to roughly C$5.50 in 2025.

There is material upside potential to my FCF estimate if oil prices remain higher or if the company fully delivers on its target for $2 bn of FFO growth by 2025. The company has raised its outlook for WTI in 2021 to $65 a barrel, in-line with today’s prices. Given the massive underinvestment in new oil since 2013, there seems to be a good chance of oil prices overshooting their long-term margin cost of production. At $65 oil, the company could generate almost C$8/share of FCF in 2025, or almost 40% more than my estimate at $55 oil, showing the significant upside leverage to oil prices inherent in the business.

To value the company I use a discounted five-year forward multiple of 9x on 2025 FCF of C$5.50 to arrive at a fair value target of ~C$50, or 115% upside to fair value. I think on a normalized basis this company is worth the long-term average, one-year forward market multiple of ~16.5x, which I discount at 11.5% per year to get to 9x for a five-year forward multiple. Today, the market trades at a nearly 30% premium to its long-term average, so if the company traded at its long-term run-rate FCF and 16.5x today it would still be well below market.

Flexibility and Resilience:

Suncor’s performance during 2020 demonstrates how flexible and resilient the company can be during periods of extreme stress, which bolsters the case for the margin of safety and downside protection in the name. When oil prices and oil demand both collapsed last year, Suncor was able to slash planned capex by 30%, and opex by 12%, and reduce its fully-loaded breakeven from $45/barrel WTI to $35. With an investment-grade balance sheet and low leverage (only 1.5x net debt to FFO), the company was able to raise capital in the debt markets at low rates to increase its liquidity. Additionally, the company was able to flex its integrated model and consistently achieve higher utilization from its refineries than the industry averages. The company’s ability to rapidly adjust to severe changes in the environment, and the financial flexibility provided by a strong balance give confidence that the company can weather challenges in the future.

Summary:

Suncor presents an opportunity to invest in a low exploration risk, steady producer of energy with very low cash costs, and therefore excellent downside protection, and remarkable upside if oil prices remain near their long-term marginal cost of production or overshoot given recent underinvestment in new capacity. The company has prioritized value maximization over volume growth for the next 5 years, thus reducing operational risk and increasing the likelihood of hitting its targets.

Furthermore, the company has committed to returning nearly 100% of the price of today’s stock to shareholders over the next 5 years, dramatically reducing tail risk. If you buy Suncor today and it hits its targets, you get almost all your money back in 5 years and then you get to stick around for whatever value is left in the company. My bet is that there’s a great deal left in the tanks by then, given the challenge of transitioning the global economy away from fossil fuels, and the company’s efforts to pivot as that transition occurs.

A Note on ESG:

For those concerned about ESG risks, Suncor is at the forefront of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in its industry, having recently committed to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, and leading its four largest peers to join in this commitment, representing 90% of oil sands producers in the country, and about 10% of Canada’s total greenhouse gas emissions, representing a massive potential impact. Suncor has been a champion of best practices in ESG for many years, first reporting on sustainability over 25 years ago, and first launching quantitative emissions and impact reduction goals 12 years ago. Their most recent targets include reducing their GHG intensity 30% by 2030 from 2014 levels. This spring they added a new long-term target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and an additional target of reducing their absolute GHG emissions by 10 megatonnes by 2030, on top of their existing target of 30% reduction in emissions intensity. As an energy-intensive business, if Suncor can achieve these targets, it will make a bigger positive impact on the planet than a host of other “normal” companies greening up their own operations.

Marchex has lost money for years with the stock performing poorly.  In 2020, things got worse as Covid affected their business.  However, they divested their declining Local Leads business in October leaving a call analytics software business that has growth prospects.  In particular, technological advances in natural language processing and artificial intelligence has led to an emerging ""sales engagement"" application that is higher value. Marchex has a competitive advantage in selling these new sales engagement applications to their existing call analytics customer base that is the largest in the industry. The heavy R&D spend and the high expenses from integrating strategic acquisitions related to development of these sales engagement applications continues, however.  The years of losses will continue for at least a couple more quarters, and adoption is not assured. Management that owns 15% of the company promises to sell if this three-year development  project doesn’t result in profitability in the next couple of years.  Recent private-market transactions for competitors in this emerging space were well more than twice the current Marchex valuation.  The company and the largest investor together tendered for and purchased 5 million shares each at $2.15 closing in early October.  Patient investors could make multiples if the R&D spend and acquisitions pay off, and perhaps do okay in a sale even if they do not.
Call analytics software was initially pretty rudimentary.  It monitored how long callers were on hold and how long they would wait before hanging up.  It could record how many calls came in at different hours of the day and whether the operation was short-staffed at certain hours resulting in excessive hold times and lost business.  In recent years, artificial intelligence has aided computers in recognizing and understanding human language resulting in devices like Siri and the Google Home speaker.  Call analytics software can now create transcripts of the calls for a tire shop.  Employees using inappropriate language or not following the sales script can be detected.  Large conversation data sets can be analyzed to show that employees that ask for and then refer to that caller by name result in a higher number of appointments being made.  With that insight, training can teach employees to ask for names and the software can make sure they do by monitoring future calls. With even further progress, artificial intelligence is now being used to detect intent and assess customer sentiment from the tones in the conversation.  Historically, call analytics analyzed calls to gain insights to help improve employees future call performance.  Real-time assistance to the employee is being tested now, however, with these features known in the industry as “Sales Engagement” tools.  Marchex Sales Rescue product detects using AI trained from prior data sets that a caller had intent to make a service appointment, for example, but when the call was transferred to the service department nobody picked up.  Sales Rescue notifies employees that this occurred so they can immediately call the prospective customer back and make the appointment.  Many more AI assisted sales engagement applications are in pilot-testing or development, both by Marchex and competitors. 
Two industry reports are useful to investors.  The Forrester Wave Sales Engagement Q3 2020 report characterizes Marchex as a “Contender”.  It concludes “While the vendor brings deep automotive consultative expertise to the table — it has nine of the 15 OEMs and 21 of the 34 brands in the US as its customers — the platform lacks the breadth and depth of some table-stakes features present in other vendors. Marchex's reference customers view the vendor as a strategic partner that is in tune with their needs but would like to see the vendor enhance its sales training and coaching capabilities. Marchex is a natural fit for any automotive or automotive value chain business, companies in the home services industries, and those in other traditional industries”.  The report identifies competitor Outreach as a “Leader”.  It is a privately-held leader in Sales Engagement serving technology companies that recently completed a $50 million Series F round at a $1.3 billion valuation.  Marchex shareholders can hope for a fraction of Outreach’s valuation by winning the emerging higher value Sales Engagement business from their existing analytics customers in the niches they dominate.
The Opus Conversational Intelligence report is the 2nd useful industry review report.  It defines the opportunity noting “Businesses have stepped up investment in technologies that improve the conversations they carry on with both prospects and customers. They are successfully leveraging their investment in speech and text analytics, natural language processing and machine learning in order to extract meaning and recognize the intent of each individual”.  Marchex is categorized as one of the four leading companies, #1 overall, and received the best rating in all four categories evaluated.  The commentary notes Marchex’s  superior transcription accuracy (better than Watson), omnichannel capabilities after incorporating the texting application from the Sonar acquisition, and the largest customer base (over 1300 companies).  The report notes the $75 million investment from Morgan Stanley in December 2019 for Calminer, one of the four “leaders”identified.  Marchex investors relation lead, Trevor, confirms Calminer is “great”, but he notes they generally do not directly compete with Marchex.  Calminer primarily serves call centers who are less attractive customers as they mostly look to cut costs.  The second highest rated company, $50 million estimated revenue Invoca, raised $56 million in Dec 2019 at a $225 million valuation.  Invoca is serving U.S. Bank, Dish Network, and others using AI to analyze conversations and is close in size to the $46 million run rate of the remaining Marchex  conversational analytics business. 
Marchex is much cheaper than their perhaps more successful comparables.  It’s also cheap compared to the money invested in their remaining conversational analytics business.  Three recent acquisitions, Sonar in Dec 2019 for $9.5 million, Call Analytics for $35.0 million in Nov 2018, and Telemetrics for $10.1 million also in Nov. 2018, total $54.6 million.  The R&D spend in 2018, 2019, and 2020 ran about $15 million, $20 million, and $20 million for a total of $55 million.  The heavy spending includes integration of the acquisitions, development of AI applications, and development of Marchex Stream.  Marchex Stream is consolidating all their data onto a central server using Snowflake to enable AI applications.  Tying the data together from multiple customer sites all over the country enables AI analysis and real-time implementation.  “The technology is powered by Marchex’s growing base of more than one billion minutes of analyzed consumer-to-business conversations and employs deep learning techniques including convolutional neural network developments pioneered by the Marchex MIND Lab team”.
Recent financial performance of the remaining conversational analytics business looks approximately like this:
2020:  $46 million run rate with $10 million ebitda loss. Down despite buying low revenue Sonar in Dec 2019 for $9.5 million (Even Q1 before coronavirus was down)
2019:  $52.3 million but this is up in part from Call Analytics and Telemetrics acquisitions in Nov 2018 for $35.0 million and $10.1 million (with $3 million more earnout)
2018:  $35.4 million
2017:  $29.4 million
Management attributes slower growth in 2019 and 2020 to the use of resources to integrate the acquisitions and to a reduction in customer call volumes due to Covid.  Marchex is paid for performing analytics on phone calls at a rate of roughly 5 cents a minute with roughly 70% gross margins.  Roll out of the newly developed AI Sales Edge applications were delayed as customers focused on just surviving the pandemic.  In particular, their senior living business was “just destroyed” and roll-outs of software to dentists offices were simply stopped as the dentists laid off the implementation staff.  Trevor (investor relations lead) notes that the next couple of quarterly reports will certainly be slow, especially Q4 2020 which is seasonally slow.  He does note that customers are finally now at least talking to them about rolling out Sales Edge pilots when Covid is over.  Contracts with larger customers are extending to two or three years instead of one with lower minimums.  Trevor believes the longer contracts reflect the increasing importance of conversational analytics to their customers.  Some Sales Edge contracts are becoming a flat monthly rate per location rather than tied to call volumes.
The history of the company has been mostly negative going public in a 2005 IPO at $6.50 a share and reaching $20 a share before beginning a long torturous slide.  The company has paid dividends, including special dividends of excess cash, and bought back shares multiple times, but still the returns have been poor.  The company founder, Russell Horowitz still serves as co-ceo along with long-time executive Arends.  Horowitz owns approximately 15% of the company but through class A super-voting shares that give him control.  Horowitz and Arends each have cash salaries of $300K which is fairly modest for their Seattle location.  They’re suffering along with shareholders as their options and incentives have turned out to be mostly worthless.  The largest shareholder, Jonathan Brolin, comes from a private equity background and runs Edenbrook Capital like a private equity fund investing in public companies.  He explains his patient investment philosophy in this presentation that explains that losses for extended times are acceptable to him in order to build long-term shareholder value.  He’s supportive of management’s efforts to remake the company as detailed in this letter.  Marchex is Edenbrook’s largest position after buying the additional 5 million shares in the tender offer at $2.15 and more shares at $2.50 from put option exercises. 
Horowitz and Arends have let losses drag on for some time to pursue the emerging conversational analytics business including the new sales engagement tools.  Trevor at investor relations acknowledges that the company's performance has not been good.  “We’re a $2 stock”, he notes, but he corrected me when I suggested if the company didn’t turn around the financials within three years, the company might be sold.  “I don’t think Horowitz will let it go on even that long”.   Marchex is an attractive acquisition target with the largest customer base and the largest recorded call data set in the industry.  Large data sets are required for effective AI development, and data is much better if drawn from the particular industry. Data sets of conversations from automotive dealerships is needed to develop AI applications for automotive dealerships. Marchex has a significant advantage in developing the new AI-based sales engagement tools for their existing customers. If Marchex fails, it likely wouldn’t be hard to find a buyer, and Horowitz’s 15% interest is worth far more than his $300K cash salary.  Success with their Sales Edge AI offering is definitely not assured, but investors are unlikely to lose much money from current prices even if it’s not successful.
Scuttlebut
A corporate development guy at a startup conversational analytics firm that mostly serves call centers provided some comments.  He noted that call center software had become stagnant for a few years.  The development of natural language processing changed that, however.  The software can now create transcripts and notes automatically for a $20 an hour call center employee that gets yelled at a lot.   AI is a ""big leap"" helping agents with an insurance claim as it comes in live. 
On the other hand, an executive at one of the leading competitors to Marchex was more skeptical of AI.  All our customers are asking for AI.  However, they don’t even know what it is; they just know they want it.  Actually creating an AI algorithm that gives insights that ultimately results in higher sales conversions is elusive.  He suggested we ask company’s touting AI for specific examples where it was successful.  Marchex has clients clamoring for AI also, but watch to see if the new Sales Edge applications actually improve financials for those clients.  Customers want to try new AI stuff, but there's a risk it doesn't help their bottom line. The thesis for this investment is that the new AI applications will result in higher value software. If it doesn't, Marchex's advantage in selling it to their existing customers won't be worth anything.
Finally, a Marchex senior employee spoke highly of Horowitz.  He noted it was a diverse group at the company and that the positive culture and the strategy the company is pursuing are the reasons he’s at Marchex.
  In Summary,  Conversational analytics has arisen from call analytics due to technological advances in natural language processing and artificial intelligence.  Marchex has the largest customer base in call analytics and the largest data sets from which to derive AI insights.  They have a competitive advantage offering these higher value applications to their large existing customer base.  Marchex has spent a lot of R&D and acquisition money to pursue the opportunity, and the stock trades at a fraction of this spend and a fraction of the valuations of competitor's private-market financing transactions.  The decline of the now-divested Local Leads business coupled with all this investment has made this company’s financials disastrous for a long time.  Losses will continue for at least a while longer.  Either the investments begin to pay off with potentially excellent stock price reaction or the company will be sold within two or three years.
I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

Note: First VIC posting, never going to try to use bullet points again from word. Huge failure, please excuse formatting (spaces between bullets)
  Intro:
  Fisher Communications in a VIC name that has been around for a while, but has recently become relevant again as a potential opportunity.  Maggie2002 did a helpful write-up in May, 2010-anyone interested should consult that analysis as well. The basic premise here is that you have an extremely cheap broadcasting company which is poorly run, sub scale and really shouldn't be a public company. Although I hate to use Broadcast Cash Flow, in this case it makes sense to use it instead of EBITDA, because FSCI is likely to be an acquisition target over the next 6-12 months and its corporate costs are bloated enough to obscure the valuation of its assets. These costs will go away (including public company costs, management costs etc) when a larger strategic makes a play at FSCI. We believe FSCI would have already been an acquisition target, if not for having until recently having other extraneous assets and a management team with no desire to sell.
We value FSCI at $41 per share in value as an acquisition target, versus the current trading price of ~$26. That is assuming 8x BCF for the TV stations, at a discount to recent multiples for transactions.
                                           The activist angle has been around FSCI for a long time-Mario Gabelli has been pushing for them to be a seller for years, but it appears that the clock has finally run out on management's stonewalling to keep their jobs.  On December 5, GAMCO filed a 13d with the SEC stating they are looking at board nominations and Towerview filed a D the next day stating that they would be interested in working with other investors. Together these two funds control 37% of the vote. Normally the staggered board would stop them from being able to make a ton of progress, but the heavy lifting is done, with 3 board members of the 9 already placed there by FrontFour (activist spin out from Pirate Capital). There are 3 class II Directors whose terms are expiring in 2013, and we would expect all of them to be in play-Colleen Brown (CEO), Donald Graham (original founding family), and Brian McAndrews. Willey, Goldfarb and Troy were all nominated by FrontFour and should join together with the new directors to shop the company. We believe the market is overlooking the importance of the most recent activist move, given fatigue over an activist campaign that has gone on for years.

We would expect GAMCO to nominate new directors, and for them to be placed on the board in May of 2013. From there we would guess they would start a strategic process to sell the assets, which could take another 6 months or so. All in, assume a timeline of year with upside of approximately 60% if it plays out the way we expect.



Background:
  Fisher Communications is a broadcasting company, primarily operating free to air local TV stations in the Northwest
Company was founded in Seattle in 1910 as a flour mill operator and has morphed it's business over time
  More recently the company has undergone a restructuring as it has generally trimmed its focus towards TV broadcasting
Sold 24 small market stations in Eastern Washington and Montana to Cumulus in 2006 for $33MM
Kept Seattle stations and Great Falls (unclear why they held on to Great Falls at this point)
Sold a 2% stake in Safeco Insurance to Liberty Mutual in 2008
Sold Liberty Plaza for $160 MM (versus $108 MM in book value) to Hines Realty in December 2011
Prime property, with strong rents and a data center that has seen strong demand
Sold property at a 5% cap rate
Divested of Great Falls stations at end of 2011 (just leaving Seattle radio stations)
  The primary remaining assets are ABC/Univision duopolies in Seattle and Portland
They are the #13 and #22 DMA respectively
In both cities, the ABC affiliate is a strong #2 to Belo's assets and has seen strong market share growth over the last 5 years
  Fisher also owns 16 other TV stations across 7 other markets primarily in the Northwest and California
Paid a 15x multiple ($55MM) for Bakersfield duopoly in 2008 in a deal that will mark the top of the market
It is estimated that Portland/Seattle make up approximately 60% of revenue for the TV segment
All of the other markets are in sub 100 DMA’s
Company recently paid $9MM to add another station in Eugene, creating a duopoly
While we generally don’t like this mgmt team allocating capital, paying mid to high single digit BCF to create a duopoly isn’t the end of the world
  FSCI has exposure to approximately 3.5% of viewers in the US, relatively small for a standalone broadcasting company
  Colleen Brown was elected CEO of Fisher in 2005 after a 25 year career in Media that included stops at Gannett, Lee and Belo
The general consensus is that she has done a good job of growing market share and solidifying #2 position in Seattle and Portland, but poorly in everything else
Missteps include Bakersfield acquisition, inability to get margins anywhere in-line with the industry, generally poor capital allocation and poor governance
She is the primary impediment to business being sold, sees herself as someone who can grow business as opposed to selling
She owns approximately $2 MM in stock
    Investment Thesis:
Board members put in place by activists already control 3 of the 9 seats, this will be going to a majority after annual meeting in May (6 of 9) if Gabelli puts up a new slate (which seems likely)
Concentrated shareholder base and past success make it unlikely that management would win a proxy fight battle
  Portland/Seattle are attractive large DMA’s with good demographic trends, we think they would be good markets for larger strategics to want to expand
Most of the value of FSCI is in these two cities
  Gabelli has made it clear over a long period of time that he thinks FSCI should be sold, this will be his chance to act upon it
  Stock is worth approximately $41 per share assuming 8x BCF on the TV side and including $5MM of corporate costs in TV BCF
Newport TV sold for 10.5x BCF this summer, and Gannett and SBGI have both paid 8x+ (to the buyer) recently
  Company has been historically mismanaged, margins are 10% lower than their competitors despite having attractive stations, much more upside if you get paid for any of that margin improvement opportunity
Mgmt used to state that they could get to 40% margins on TV side, have since dropped that claim
We believe SBGI etc could get more out of these stations
  Retrans contracts provide a nice tailwind to earnings on a full year basis for 2013
  Absent a sale, opportunity for improved capital structure with net cash on the balance sheet even after the large one-time dividend in October (see Gabelli filing on levered recap)
  FSCI announced on 12/17 that they plan on spending $15MM in share repurchases in 2013, which should be a good use of capital

12/06/12: Towerview also files 13d and say they may speak to Gabelli or others on nomianation
             



Valuation:
We are valuing FSCI in terms of value to a strategic, because we believe that is the most likely outcome and core to the investment thesis. We assume a BCF multiple plus an estimate of the amount of expense from Corporate that really should be in BCF-rent on Fisher Plaza allocated to TV stations plus some other odds and ends. Please note that multiples on similarly attractive assets in recent transactions have actually been higher.
  Also noted is valuation as a standalone basis-we do not think that it trades at a discount to standalone value. Possibly over time if they were to make smart acquisition and leverage their corporate costs, it could become attractive-but we would not invest behind that thesis.

M&A Environment:
The M&A environment in Local TV stations has generally been robust, although not quite as excessive as pre-recession. 8x+ BCF multiples to the buyer are common for the larger and more attractive transactions. Sometimes the BCF multiples by the acquirer will be materially different because of assumed synergies with duopolies etc reported by the acquirer.
  Generally Local TV is moving more and more towards a scale business. To be relevant with advertisers, station operators need reach; to negotiate retrans with MSO’s it is helpful to have more stations and the same goes with negotiating network deals. This has led to a general consolidation in the industry. We would expect this consolidation to continue.
  We believe the reasons FSCI has not participated in the consolidation stem mainly from management, and secondarily from asset mix. Mgmt does not own a lot of stock, and is economically incentivized to keep their jobs. We do not expect this to change, but believe it will be taken out of their hands. Secondly, having the real estate and the radio assets may have quelled some interest because TV operators didn’t want to deal with the disposition. The real estate is gone and the radio has shrunk-we would expect they could sell the radio stations to someone like an Entercom in advance of any larger deal.
  As you can see from the below chart, there have been very healthy multiples paid for scale TV assets in the last couple of years. We would expect SBGI, LIN, Gannett, Journal Communications and EW Scripps to be players that would have some interest. BLC and Meredith can’t bid, Tribune seems unlikely, as does Nexstar.

Thesis Summary
  An under-the-radar power producer in Alberta, Canada has been quietly investing in a clean energy technology that could prove to be revolutionary. Capital Power Corporation (TSX:CPX) is a C$4-billion market cap independent power producer with a strong, under-appreciated base business with a free option on a new technology that cost-effectively converts carbon dioxide into valuable carbon nanotubes. We believe Capital Power’s base business is worth C$43 per share and its budding clean-tech nanotube investment could be worth anywhere between C$4 and C$45 per share on a risk-adjusted basis. At the current share price of ~C$36, we believe the market undervalues the base business and also ascribes zero value to a tremendous opportunity that could more than double the Company’s share price.
  An Attractive Base Business with Limited Downside
  Capital Power is a growth-oriented North American power producer headquartered in Alberta, Canada. The company develops, acquires, owns and operates coal, gas and wind-based power generation facilities. In total, the company owns 6,400 megawatts (MW) of generation capacity across 25 well-situated facilities, with an average asset life of only 14 years.  
  Management is currently executing on a diversification strategy that has considerably de-risked the company’s business profile over the past 5 years. By the end of 2021, the company will have transitioned from coal-fired power plants generating 55% of EBITDA in 2015 to only 30% of EBITDA being generated by dual-fuel plants capable of either coal or gas-based generation.  The remaining 70% of EBITDA will be derived from gas-only and wind power facilities. The company will also have reduced its concentration of Alberta-based power generation from 75% in 2015 to 50%. Management has accomplished this transformation while retaining an investment grade balance sheet, growing AFFO by a 13% CAGR and maintaining a strong contracted cash flow profile for the majority of the business. 
  By the end of this year, approximately 2/3 of EBITDA will be locked-in under long-term wind and gas generation contracts, with a weighted average duration exceeding 10 years. Management is currently addressing two near-term contract expiries related to assets that are very favourably positioned in their respective jurisdictions – the Decatur Energy Center in Alabama and Island Generation in British Columbia. Once these contracts are renewed, the weighted average contract life for the contracted portfolio will increase to 11+ years. 
  The remaining 1/3 of Capital Power’s EBITDA will be earned in the Alberta merchant power market, which is an oligopoly market with the forward power price curve indicating robust pricing in the C$53-$60 per MW range over the next 3 years. We expect improving free cash flow in the near term. With strong plant performance and a highly effective hedging strategy, management has consistently demonstrated realized prices in excess of spot market prices for its Alberta merchant portfolio. 
  Longer term, power demand in Alberta is a legitimate risk if one is bearish on Alberta oil and gas investment. However, the risk of stranded assets is low, as Capital Power’s younger, lower-cost plants are much more efficient than those of competitors and therefore, operate at a higher load factor and are unlikely to be displaced in the event supply needs to exit the market due to lower than expected demand. Additionally, if new pipeline capacity isn’t built, and oil and gas development remains subdued, AECO (Alberta) gas prices are sure to remain lower for longer, providing a nice hedge in the form of lower input costs for Capital Power’s efficient gas-fired fleet. For context, AECO gas forward pricing is currently averaging only ~US$1.50/MMBtu for the next 3 years, making gas-fired power generation in Alberta very inexpensive, even under the Canadian federal government’s current carbon tax pricing regime. 
  The current share price of ~C$36 implies an EV/EBITDA of 8.8x and a free cash flow yield of 14.5% on F21 consensus, which we believe is easily achievable. With 2/3 of the business underpinned by long-term contracts and the other 1/3 derived from well-positioned assets in a rational oligopoly market, we believe the current valuation is too punitive. A more reasonable valuation for the base business would be C$43, based on 9.5x EV/EBITDA and a 12% free cash flow yield. 
  The Little-Known Clean Energy Technology that could be Revolutionary
  In May 2018, Capital Power invested C$3mm in a little-known company by the name of C2CNT, a developer of innovative technology that captures and transforms carbon dioxide into a high-value product called carbon nanotubes. The company was founded by Dr. Stuart Licht, a Professor of Chemistry at George Washington University and expert in the field of electrochemistry. Its stated mission is to “save the planet from the ravages of climate change” by “removing anthropogenic carbon dioxide and pioneering a transformative carbon economy.”
  Extracting carbon from smoke stacks is not a new idea; but using the captured carbon to produce carbon nanotubes (CNTs) cost effectively is potentially revolutionary. C2CNT’s patented process splits carbon dioxide molecules by molten electrolysis into CNT and oxygen components. The CNTs extracted from the process are a high-value material that, when added to materials such as concrete, steel or aluminum, forms composites with significantly enhanced structural properties. 
  CNTs are considered by those that study the science to be the strongest material ever measured. Enhancing the strength of concrete, steel or aluminum opens the door to less material usage to achieve a desired application. Using round numbers as an example, according to C2CNT, a 3,000-tonne block of concrete can be replaced by an equally strong 2,000-tonne block of CNT-concrete composite through the addition of only 1 tonne of CNTs. This reduces the concrete that needs to be produced for an application by one-third, resulting in significant costs savings for a concrete producer. (i.e. adding 1 tonne of CNTs displaces 1,000 tonnes of concrete.)
  The following link provides more background on C2CNT: https://www.c2cnt.com/
  CNTs have been researched and tested extensively by the scientific community, but the application of the material has been very limited on account of the prohibitive cost to mass produce. Under currently-utilized methods, industrial-scale production of high-quality CNTs can suffer from from low yields, high material and energy costs, and purity and other quality control challenges.  Whereas industrial grade CNT production costs have typically been in excess of US$100,000 per tonne, C2CNT has measured its production cost in the US$1,000 per tonne range. For context, industrial grade CNTs sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars per tonne, implying a substantial margin opportunity for a low-cost producer. 
  The following link provides examples of industrial grade CNT pricing, which are shown to be in excess of US$199 per kg ($199,000 per tonne):

  The following are links to Dr. Licht’s research and technical papers, which provide additional background on C2CNT’s production process and relevant costs:

  https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1710/1710.07246.pdf
  Given C2CNT’s breakthrough in production costs, large global steel, aluminum and cement producers have shown a keen interest in Dr. Licht’s work. The potential to substantially reduce production costs for producers of structural material is certainly a strong motivator, but the significant reduction in CO2 emissions could be of equally compelling benefit. Investor scrutiny of major industrial CO2 emitters, such as cement producers, has intensified tremendously over the past few years. For example, CEMEX, one of the world’s largest cement producers, is acting on environmental initiatives aggressively, recently setting a target to reduce its CO2 emissions by 35% by 2030. C2CNT’s technology would allow a cement producer like CEMEX to significantly reduce its carbon footprint by cost-effectively capturing and converting the CO2 emitted from its production process into CNTs, which could then be sold or utilized internally, significantly offsetting the cost of cement production.
  As presented at Capital Power’s investor day this past December, C2CNT is currently working closely with major North American cement producer Lehigh Hanson (a subsidiary of Heidelberg Cement) to establish a model for the mass production of CNT-enhanced cement. Although disclosures are limited at this point, we believe feasibility of the cement-CNT composite material has already been established and the companies are currently engaged in more of a “tweaking” exercise. 
  Regarding the application of CNTs in the production of cement, Capital Power’s CEO  Brian Vaasjo stated the following at the Company’s December investor day:
  The inhibition of having these technologies move a little bit further and actually into significant production is simply cost. It's just out and out cost. And when we look at whether this enterprise is going to be successful or not, I talked earlier about it being at least an order of magnitude reduction and have tested it against prices and so on. And certainly, it works in cement, and we believe it'll work in other products. And we've got that confirmation from the cement industry. The issue is then -- or what -- where your questions are going to is, are you going to achieve in the cost and the scale that's going to make it happen. And when you look forward at Genesee, I would say, when you look at the cost of production that Professor [Licht] is going through today at Shepard, you -- it is economic even if you don't scale that up. You just have a larger footprint, greater production area, and it's a little bit more labor-intensive than it probably could be ultimately. And so there's a lot of scaling that will certainly help the economics, help the production, but in terms of it being economic, I would say, at the state it is today, it's economic. Anything else is upside.
  The above reference to “Shepard” relates to the Shepard Energy Centre, Alberta’s largest natural gas-fired power plant, which is 50% owned by Capital Power. Per the above, Brian Vaasjo is confirming, 1) C2CNT is already producing CNTs at Shepard on a small scale; 2) Capital Power has confirmed that the CNTs produced are “economic,” with an “order of magnitude reduction” in costs; and 3) CNTs do indeed “work” as a cement composite material. 
  From the investor day discussion on the Lehigh Hanson partnership, it is also worth noting that the development of the CNT-enhanced cement is being conducted at the cost of Lehigh Hanson. In any business, it is obviously a good sign that you have something of value if your prospective customer is willing to front the cost of product development. 
  Cement enhanced with CNTs is not a “fishing expedition.” It has already been demonstrated on a small scale by the scientific community that the strength of cement (and concrete) can be enhanced with the use of CNTs and similar materials. Below are slides from the investor day illustrating that cement-CNT composites have been extensively studied and tested by the scientific community:
        As summarized above, Dr. Licht estimates that for every tonne of CNTs mixed into concrete, the production of concrete could be reduced by 938 tonnes to achieve the same tensile strength as a concrete-only material. At a US$100 per tonne production cost for cement, a total of US$93,800 in savings would be generated for each tonne of CNT utilized. At the current cost of industrial grade CNTs in the US$200,000 per tonne range, substituting CNTs for concrete would be uneconomic and, hence, the principal reason why CNT-concrete composites have not historically been commercially viable. However, Dr. Licht’s breakthrough in CNT production costs would seem to change all that. At a production cost of only ~US$1,000 per tonne of CNT, one can see why C2CNT’s technology has the potential to be revolutionary.
  If successful, C2CNT’s work with Lehigh Hanson could be only the “tip of the iceberg.” Consider the size of the global concrete market, as well as the potential to address the steel and aluminum markets.
      Results of C2CNT’s work with Lehigh Hanson should be disclosed by Capital Power within the next several months. We believe results will be positive and Capital Power will exercise its option to increase its ownership interest in C2CNT to 40%. However, even if results are mixed or negative, future trials with alternate concrete producers may be successful and there is great potential for the use of CNTs with other structural materials, such as steel or aluminum. 
  What Could C2CNT’s Technology Be Worth?
  By investing in and deploying the C2CNT technology, Capital Power hopes to benefit from an improved ESG rating among investors. More importantly, if testing with Lehigh Hanson proves to be successful, Capital Power’s investments in the technology could be worth billions of dollars. We believe this potential upside remains completely unrecognized by investors and sell-side analysts.
  Capital Power currently holds a 9% ownership interest in C2CNT. If testing is successful, Capital Power will exercise an option to increase its ownership to 40% at a nominal cost. The company would also build its own industrial-scale CNT production facility at the site of its Genesee power generating station in Alberta. This production facility and all associated profits would be wholly-owned by Capital Power. At this facility, management expects to produce commercially saleable CNTs at a rate of 2,500 tonnes per year, beginning in 2021, and eventually ramping to a rate of 7,500 tonnes.
  C2CNT will target the cement industry first and operate under a licensing model. A cement producer that licenses the carbon conversion technology would incur the cost to construct its own CNT production facility and produce CNTs, but would pay a licensing fee to C2CNT. Capital Power’s CNT production facility would also be subject to a licensing fee, albeit likely at a discounted rate according to management. 
  The below figures incorporate our worst, base and best case valuations for Capital Power’s investment in the CNT technology. 
              Based on the above, and assuming development with Lehigh Hanson progresses as planned, we believe Capital Power’s CNT investments would be worth between C$8 and C$90 per share. After applying a discount of 50% to account for risk related to product development, time to ramp and execution, Capital Power’s investments would be worth between C$4 and C$45.
  After considering the value of Capital Power’s base business and risk-adjusting the Company’s CNT investments by 50%, we believe shares should be valued at between C$42 and C$93, with a C$62 base case.
      We believe the above illustrates that even if a significant discount is applied to the CNT investments value, Capital Power’s shares represent a highly compelling opportunity at the current ~C$36 price. At the current price, the base business is moderately under-valued and investors get a free call option on CNT investments that could be worth up to C$90 per share if the technology proves successful.
  Why the Opportunity Exists
  Here is why the value of Capital Power’s base business is under-appreciated and the market ascribes little-to-no value to the CNT investments:
  Conservative management – Management has a “matter-of-fact” style, focusing on strong and steady execution, without setting lofty expectations. Anyone who has met CEO Brian Vaasjo knows that he is judicious and not promotional.  Management has expressed optimism regarding C2CNT, but it is not surprising to us that disclosure on the opportunity is limited and has always been heavily couched in one form or another.
Nobody is paying attention – CPX is a “yield stock,” with a heavy Canadian retail following and limited institutional ownership. It is a niche Canadian mid-cap with a complicated story, overshadowed by its Alberta concentration. Most of the Canadian sell-side has not performed the requisite in-depth due diligence either, as the smaller market cap and limited institutional interest make it an easy perpetual “hold” rating, and it’s not perceived to be worth the time investment to fully understand the complicated story. Most of the sell-side has been slow to see Capital Power’s changing story since 2015 and we think the current state of apathy is just more of the same. Pipeline and utility analysts are simply not wired to understand and value nascent technology opportunities with tremendous potential. 
  Risks to Investment
  Significant supply or demand shocks that negatively impact power pricing in Alberta for a sustained period of time;
Expiring power purchase agreements are not re-contracted on favourable terms, or at all; and
CNT-concrete composite development with Lehigh Hanson fails and further attempts to monetize the technology also fail.

Diversified Healthcare Trust (DHC) has two series of senior unsecured baby bonds that offer good yields and are well protected by the asset base. The capital structure features a large stack of unsecured debt and minimal mortgages except for a large mortgage on a flagship office property. The company has strong liquidity and enjoyed stellar rent collection in April and May. 
DHCNI is the symbol for 5.625% senior notes due 2042. DHCNL is the symbol for 6.25% senior notes due 2046. Currently, there are $350 mm of DHCNI and $250 mm of DHCNL outstanding. As of this writing, DHCNI trades at $18 (70 cents on the dollar), offering 7.8% current yield and 8% yield to maturity. DHCNL trades at $19, offering current yield and YTM of 8.2%. Both are illiquid, trading only ~$600k a day, so they are suitable for PAs and small funds. This write up will use DHCNI for valuation math. Before the March market crash, both traded at a premium to $25 as investors chased yield. 
After the $1 bn 2025 bond offering which was used to retire $450 mm of 2020 maturities and pay down the revolver, DHC has $200 mm unsecured term loan and $2,650 mm of unsecured bonds outstanding. Face and market values of unsecured debt are $2.9 bn and $2.1 bn respectively. 
  Boston JV
DHC also has $695 mm of mortgages, but $620 mm of them is secured by two life science buildings in Boston’s Seaport District (11 Fan Pier and 50 Northern Avenue) in which DHC owns 55% (and fully consolidates the results) and a sovereign wealth fund owns 45%. 
  The two 15-story Class A office buildings are fully leased by Vertex Pharmaceuticals until 2028, a $80 bn market cap biopharmaceutical company. In 2017, DHC sold the 45% stake at $1.2 bn valuation. Net of $620 mm of mortgages, DHC’s stake is worth $319 mm. 
  NOI of the joint venture has not been disclosed, but annual distributions to NCI is $21 mm, implying $47 mm of total distributions. Distribution yield on the $580 mm of equity is 8.1%, which is reasonable or even cheap. Assuming 100% distribution of FFO and no G&A load, I estimate NOI of the JV is $70 mm, implying a 5.8% cap rate at 2017’s $1.2 bn transaction value. Again, this seems reasonable given the location and tenant quality.
  Life sciences and MOB portfolio
Excluding the Boston JV, DHC generates $180 mm of cash NOI from a portfolio of life science and medical office buildings, encumbered by only $24 mm of mortgages. These office buildings are 92% leased, and have well staggered lease expirations (only 30% expiring in the next 4 years) and a well diversified tenant base (other than Vertex, only 5 tenants represent >1% of annual rental income). MOB comps (DOC, HTA and HR) trade at 5~6% cap. Applying a 7% cap rate to DHC’s assets gets us $2.55 bn (net of $24 mm mortgages).
  For April, DHC collected 99% of rent due for its office portfolio. For the first 3 business days of May, DHC collected 86% of May rent due, in line with historical patterns. Competitors reported similar results. MOB REITs’ recent collection numbers are probably the highest among all real estate asset classes. 
  So, DHC’s 55% stake in the Boston JV ($319 mm) and its life sciences/MOB portfolio ($2.55 bn) are worth almost $2.9 bn, covering the unsecured debt at face and market values. 
      SHOP
DHC also owns a senior housing operating portfolio (SHOP). The SHOP portfolio has 30,000 units among 240 properties, with gross asset value of $4.2 bn, encumbered by only $43 mm of mortgages on 3 properties. 
  All properties were previously either leased or managed by Five Star Senior Living (FVE). Due to FVE’s poor results, DHC restructured its arrangement with FVE whereby FVE would be managing the 20,000 units it previously leased from DHC (this change became effective on Jan 1, 2020). Under the new management agreements, DHC would be operating the SHOP portfolio under the RIDEA structure, meaning DHC will be directly exposed to the revenues and opex of the assets, instead of being a passive rent collector. FVE would be managing the operations and receive a management fee equal to 5% of revenues. 
  Annualized Q120 NOI for this segment is $200 mm. As of April 30, SHOP had 350 confirmed cases (1.5% of resident population) across 46 properties. Management disclosed on the Q1 call that occupancy is declining at 40~50 bps per week due to covid-19, representing $6 mm/week of lost revenues. Obviously occupancy will find a bottom somewhere, but near term results are not going to be great due to lower occupancy and higher labor costs. However, you don’t need this portfolio to be worth anything for the bonds to be covered, and the negligible asset level leverage offers staying power into a post-covid world. 
  Other assets
DHC has $45 mm NOI from “non-segment” assets consisting of senior housing properties not managed by FVE and wellness centers. In addition, DHC owns 10 mm FVE shares valued at $43 mm. 
  Liquidity and covenants
DHC issued $1 bn of 2025 notes and used the proceeds to pay down $450 mm of 2020 maturities and the revolver. Now DHC has an unused $1 bn revolver maturing in Jan 2022. 
  The revolver’s covenants are copied below. Due to the large unencumbered pool, I don’t expect unencumbered asset related covenants to be a problem. 
  The leverage ratio is calculated with asset values assuming 7% cap rate for senior housing and 6.5% for all other assets. Currently, this ratio is at 42%. For leverage ratio to increase to 60%, NOI of the SHOP segment has to decrease by $170 mm from the current $200 mm level. 
  The office portfolio generates $250 mm of NOI (assuming 100% contribution of the Boston JV). Annual interest expense is $170 mm. Just the office portfolio provides almost 1.5x EBITDA/interest coverage. 
  While industry occupancy levels continue to decline, some leading indicators (customer leads, move-ins) are encouraging. For example, through June 8th VTR’s SHOP move-in trend already recovered to 73% of last year, rebounding from 30%s in April.  
  RMR 
DHC is externally managed by RMR, whose management fee is based on the lower of DHC's EV or historical asset value. Due to decline in DHC's share price, currently management fee is calculated using market value. RMR has an incentive to boost performance/share price of DHC, as well as to keep this as a going concern to receive the fee stream.
  In addition, DHC's G&A load is below peer average.

Investment Thesis:
Discovery Communications (DISCA) is a classic value play and not surprisingly it has garnered a lot of attention on VIC with 6 separate write-ups since 2010.  The stock has gone nowhere since 2012 so one wouldn’t be wrong to label it a value trap thus far. Since the announcement of its acquisition of Scripps Networks (SNI) on 7/31/17, the stock is basically flat, with the market up 30% in the meantime, and forward consensus estimates for 2019 EPS have increased by about 30%, so the stock has effectively de-rated by roughly 30%, to a P/E of 7X.  And with free cash flow running about 20% higher than net income, the free cash flow yield is over 15%. With leverage (at 3.3X net debt to trailing EBITDA) now in its target range of 3-3.5X, excess cash will likely be used to buy back stock. Note that from 2010 to 2017, right before the Scripps merger, the company regularly bought back roughly 5% of its outstanding shares per year, reducing shares by 34%.  We’re not going to beat a dead horse and waste white space with background filler, but we think the market is being overly pessimistic here and think this is an opportunity. Discovery emerged from the Scripps acquisition with greater scale, at a time when there is a renaissance in TV ad spending, and cost synergies are driving margin expansion. We think 2Q19, which showed an acceleration in all 4 of Discovery’s key operating metrics (U.S. ad growth up 6% y/y, U.S. affiliate fee growth up 5% y/y, international ad growth up 5% y/y, international affiliate fee growth up 3% y/y) was not a fluke, and that growth will continue through 2020.  In a nutshell, the stock is priced for no growth to perpetuity. A mere 10X FCF would yield 55% upside to $43.  
Content is King:
In the U.S., Discovery has the second largest share of U.S. TV viewing behind NBC Universal, representing 20% of total viewing time.  It has 25% of U.S. female viewers aged 25-54. Discovery has the top 4 channels in America for women, and no one’s ever done that before: ID, TLC, Food and HF, and they have the number one channel for African-American women with OWN.  Even though Discovery is the number one place to reach women, its cost per thousand (CPM) is less than half that of the broadcasters, and therein lies opportunity. They have developed a package called Discovery Premiere which allows clients to advertise exclusively in a carefully curated mix of premiere episodes from the most coveted series across Discovery’s portfolio of trusted passion brands, like Deadliest Catch, Gold Rush, Shark Week, and Property Brothers.  
Discovery has been working hard to integrate Scripps content largely on its own networks.  They are re-branding in the UK with the UKTV assets, they have launched whole channels in Germany, and they have commitments for launches in Latin America for HG and Food.  The monetization of these efforts is ahead of us. What we haven’t seen yet is selling sponsorship and high CPM packages to endemic categories - something that has been done demonstrably well in the U.S.  The international Scripps opportunity was originally presented as having 3 layers: the first layer being the cost savings, the second was utilizing the content on our existing platforms and the third was launching networks - we’re now at the point where we’re seeing the initial benefits of that third layer.  
What’s been discussed in previous write-ups and Q&A but should be included here is that Discovery’s core legacy networks like Animal Planet travel extremely well to international markets.  There’s very little local production of nature shows so Discovery’s offerings will be the default choice for most bundles.
A winning Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) Approach:
Discovery produces over 8,000 new hours of original real-life programming per year, and they have nearly 500 free-to-air and pay-TV channels with roughly 10-12 in every key market around the globe.  The combination of their strong and trusted brands and huge marketing reach give them a head start in building a DTC portfolio around immersive experiences. Their strategy is to organize their DTC portfolio around 3 broad consumer categories: sports, lifestyle and factual.  In sports they have 3 main products: the Eurosport Player across Europe, Golf TV - a global platform, and Global Cycling Network. Within lifestyle they are working on 3 different subscription-based offerings, all with different product cycles: Motor Trend, focused on car lovers, Magnolia’s unique home decor online market, and in Food they have Food Network Kitchen which I’ll describe in more detail below.  Within factual, they bring the best of Discovery and BBC real-life content to offer a comprehensive “view and do” experience. The tech platform buildout, which will serve as the backbone for Food, Home & Lifestyle and Natural History services, should be completed by the middle of 2020 with launches occurring soon after.
Discovery is in year 1 of a new PGA streaming service and it’s going very well.  Golf is great IP because it’s 52 weeks a year, 50% of the PGA tours are local, plus there’s a European tour, an Asian tour and a Latin American tour.  With Golf Digest you can read about any golf course and figure out where to take a golf vacation. Discovery is seeing great traction on their DTC golf app.  With Golf Digest, Discovery got the greatest editorial staff, the greatest photo library on golf and they put it together with the PGA. Ultimately there may be 100M people who come to golf for free - that’s an advertising platform - they are pre-screened.  They are there because they love golf. They want to see scores, they want to see what people are wearing, and they want to know what’s going on in the golf world. That’s the new broadcast network of the future. Some fraction of that 100M will want to take golf lessons with Tiger Woods. Some of them will want to see all the PGA tours live on their device.  That’s the pay model. Discovery has already climbed the learning curve successfully with Eurosport, and now they are applying that insight to golf.  
The “View and Do” model:
In late October 2019, Discovery launched “Food Network Kitchen” (FNK), the first of what is expected to be a series of DTC services that focus on interactive entertainment within Discovery’s core verticals described above.  It will offer live and on-demand cooking classes taught by celebrity chefs, integration of grocery delivery (click to order ingredients fulfilled by Amazon/Peapod/Instacart) and 24/7 live cooking advice and support. Management believes the target market is tens of millions of subscribers in the U.S.  Note that Food Network reaches 17M unique households on a weekly basis, and foodnetwork.com has 33M average unique monthly visitors. The service will cost $6.99 per month, and it will be available on various platforms with additional functionality integrated with Amazon Alexa. FNK will support 2 other revenue streams: 1) ad-supported, free access to recipes, sample classes and tutorials and 2) e-commerce revenue sharing with Amazon.  The cost of launching the service is low as Discovery will market the service using current distribution channels. The cost is already accounted for in management’s guide of $300M - $400M in DTC costs in 2019. Given the low cost structure, FNK offers the potential to be a meaningfully higher margin DTC offering, as every 5M subscribers could generate $300M-$400M in annualized subscription revenue, boosting Discovery revenues by 4-6%.  
Valuation:
DISCA is generating roughly $3B in free cash flow per year ($4.30 per share), and even with virtually no growth in OIBDA, through debt paydown and stock buybacks, FCF per share is set to increase by about 7%/yr.  Applying a pretty punitive 10X multiple on ‘19E FCF would fetch a $43 stock for 55% upside. As a gut check, on consensus FY20E P/E this would be a 10.9X multiple and on consensus FY20E EV/OIBDA it would be 8.3X (using end of year 2020 forecast net debt).  
  Risks:
Competition: New OTT TV competitors such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Video compete for consumer time and ad dollars.  To compete against these threats as well as video games like Fortnite and Apex Legends, Discovery’s production costs are rising while viewer ratings are falling, implying structural margin pressure.
Negative Mix Shift: The transition to the internet platform puts downward pressure on pricing power.  For example, Youtube pays 1/10th traditional TV revenue ($0.03/viewer/hour vs $0.30/viewer/hour) to content owners.  Typical ad loads in premium video content like Discovery’s in the digital world have 80% lower ad loads for the same content in the linear TV ecosystem.
Ratings Pressure: Ratings declines put downward pressure on ad revenue because advertising is sold on a CPM viewers’ basis and lower ratings limit Discovery’s ability to take advantage of the strong scatter market since valuable advertising inventory must be used for audience “make-goods” (audience deficiency units) rather than sold for cash.  
I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise do not hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.
Catalyst
Earnings 11/7/19 premarket: Yes, no time to act unfortunately unless you can buy after hours.  We do think this is setting up well for another beat and raise but this pitch is not based on an earnings call.
Summer Olympics: late July/early August should provide a revenue spike in 3Q20, but with elevated expenses the profit uplift will be more modest.
DTC Initiatives: Will play out through 2020, but early focus will be on the Food Network Kitchen launch.  AMZN should be an important stimulant for growth.",7.403391829260271,-21.018416694018647,-23.72697568836583,37.05308786925604,7.176660550680021,-7.606654906557759,7.587801490990947,36.87914555939774

We are recommending a long position in Xtreme Coil Drilling Corp. (Ticker: XDC-CA).  We see 50% to 75% upside over the coming twelve months based on:
Convergence of the current market value of the company with its Net Asset Value
XDC’s assets are new, best-in-class oil services assets that earn solid IRRs (20% to 35%).  We don’t see any reason for these assets to trade at a 40% discount to what they cost to produce
Adjusting for asset additions and changes to the balance sheet, such a convergence would result in a move in the stock from roughly $3.00 to above $5.00
Net debt will peak in 2Q after which the company will start to generate significant FCF and reduce its debt
The company has faced execution challenges in its coiled tubing unit (“CT”) – but, we think these issues will finally end this quarter (2Q 2012).  Once investors see that such issues are behind XDC and operators in the field appreciate how well these assets perform – we think the stock will graduate from its current ‘show-me’ status
At some point we think the Founder / CEO will be a seller of this company
This would be consistent with his history of building technology oriented oil services companies and then selling them
There are a variety of companies that would be interested in owning this set of assets
An acquisition could result in more than a 2x from current levels
Brief Business Description and Detail on Company Assets
Description:  XDC is an onshore drilling and well services contractor that works with exploration and production companies in the U.S. and internationally.

Note:  Three of XDC’s drilling assets in Canada are temporarily idle as they wait through seasonal ‘break-up’.  This is an annual occurrence during spring thaw when roads are closed and rigs can’t be moved.   We have not characterized these rigs are technically ‘stacked’ in the long term sense as they are just waiting for the roads to open and then will return to work.
Drilling Assets:  XDC had 21 drilling rigs at the end of Q1 2012 (20 operating).  Four more rigs will be delivered over the course of 2012 (for a total of 25 rigs).  Across the board these rigs are high spec (AC, top drives, high horsepower mud pumps, skid/walking packages, craneless rig-up, etc.).  Upon delivery of the four additional rigs this year the average age of the rig fleet will be less than three years.
Thus, XDC owns what in every regard is a young, very high spec fleet.  These types of assets are garnering near 100% utilization in the market at present.  These are also the kinds or rigs that other drilling companies are eager to build/acquire.
Coiled Tubing Assets:  At the end of Q1 XDC had two coiled tubing rigs operating in Saudi Arabia, three operating in North America, and three more rigs that are substantially completed but are waiting on pumps for deployment.  Coiled Tubing has been a bit of a slow moving train wreck as XDC selected the wrong vendor for mud pumps and that company has not been able to deliver.   As a result these substantially complete rigs have sat idle. 
As this played out investors lost faith in this part of the XDC story – the delays have been a source of constant disappointment.  The good news is we believe XDC has taken control of this process and all five of the new XSR rigs will be in operation by the end of the second quarter (see XDC’s 4/3/12 ops update).  Admittedly this is probably two quarters later on average than originally anticipated and delayed considerable EBITDA contribution – but, we think the wait is almost over.
Importantly, these are the highest spec coiled service rigs in North America.  We don’t have the time/space here to discuss every differentiating aspect of these rigs.  The most important thing to understand is that they use longer, larger diameter (2 5/8”) coiled tubing to reach further into wells (over 20,000 feet) than other coiled tubing units in the field today (most coiled tubing is 1” to 2” in diameter and extends 5000sf to 17,000sf max).  Also, we expect the extra power and more precise control on the coil to allow XDC to perform down-hole work much more quickly with many few motor stalls (again, see XDC’s 4/3/12 ops update).  Although initially they will probably charge 2” CT type pricing – ultimately the XSRs’ benefits will allow them to charge a premium to the market.  It will simply take a few months for ‘company men’ in the field to appreciate the benefits of these super high spec CT units that XDC has brought to market. 
Valuing the Assets
The following section provides a valuation of the assets of Xtreme.  Our valuation of each class of asset is based on a number of things.  First, we looked at the balance sheet to understand the costs to make/buy the drilling rigs and CT units.  Second, we’ve spoken extensively with management and have taken into account their views on the subject.  Third, we’ve spoken to other public companies in drilling and oil services to understand how they view the value of XDC’s assets.  Finally, we worked with independent experts in rig valuation to get their perspective.   (Potential investors who seek to replicate this body of work should not find it too difficult.  Rigs transact pretty frequently and there are a host of people who will provide valuation services.)
The first part of our valuation focuses on how much each asset is worth individually.  Second, we look at how much the company might garner for this set of assets in the aggregate (with the current contracts attached)

If you take this asset value, add in net non-cash working capital of $20mm, and subtract year-end net debt (roughly $110mm) you arrive at NAV of $330.  This divided by 66mm share outstanding= $5.00 per share or more than a 60% premium to today’s share price.
We think this is a good baseline valuation and that the stock should trade in line with the net value of its assets (not at a 40% discount as they do today).   Simply improving operations and deploying new assets should be enough to achieve this:
-  Solid economics on newly deployed XSR 500s
These rigs will start working on multiple year contracts with a $26k to $28k day rates and cash costs of $13k per day
Assume 96% utilization which is 350 days per year (use 96% utilization rather than 100% due to rigs getting paid less during mobilization days)  This implies just under $5mm in EBITDA annual per rig or ~4 year payback (accounting for minor maintenance capex) 
-  The CT rigs are more of a spot (call out) market but at 65% to 70% expected utilization the payback is less than three years
-  Per 4/3/12 (page 9) presentation on the website – Drilling IRRs are expected at 20%+ and CT IRRs at 35%+  
-  Obviously, the current demand environment (and therefor pricing) can change.  But, given that current pricing is prevailing even in a $2.00 natural gas environment gives us comfort.  Of course, if oil drops substantially then the rate picture will become more challenging (this factor is hard to avoid in any energy services stock)
Overall though, we think that as new drilling rigs come on, XDC finally executes on the CT rigs, and debt peaks in 2Q and then starts to come down, the stock will trade closer its NAV implying a share price above $5.00 per share.
But, we also think there is a reasonable chance that XDC is sold in the coming few years.  Why do we think this?  First, this is the history of the founder/CEO – he somewhat of a serial entrepreneur.  His history includes:
-  Founder and Director of Round-up Well Servicing - eventually sold to Plains Energy
-  Founder and Chairman of Savanna Energy Services Corp (2001-2005) which is at present a Canadian public company (E&P services)
-  Early Investor and Director Plains Energy Corp (Sold to Precision Drilling in 2000)
-  Was involved in Junior E&Ps including Wrangler West Energy (Director) and Player Petroleum (Director)
It is also interesting to note that the current CFO was also CFO for Bronco Drilling when it was sold to Chesapeake Energy in April of 2011.  Given his experience, he would be well prepared to run a sale process if called upon. 
Also, two large shareholders (Lime Rock – Energy P/E Firm at 19.3% and Shell Technology Ventures Fund 1 – Shell’s venture investing effort at 10.6%) will ultimately prefer a sale of the company due to their large positions and somewhat limited liquidity in the stock.
Finally, another key reason that we think XDC will ultimately be sold is that it represents a perfect acquisition for a number of oil service companies.  It could be purchased by an existing drilling company to acquire new, high quality assets and upgrade their fleet.  Alternatively, an oil service company without drilling assets but looking to diversify might also be interested in XDC.  In either case it is a nice bite-size at about $500mm such that it moves the needle for a host of mid-sized companies but is also a deal size that is in reach of many potential acquirers.
In the current environment we would expect an acquirer to pay a modest premium to NAV for the following reasons:
It is difficult of to find a portfolio of new, high-spec equipment of this size.  To replicate it would take a number of years of new-building.  XDC represents a very fast way to add assets and upgrade an existing fleet
The majority of the rigs have solid contact coverage with almost 70% of days covered through 2013
XDC has the highest spec coiled tubing rigs in North America.  Most CT is 2” or below.  XDC CT is larger, will reach out further, and is more precisely controlled than the rest of the market.  As well, they have a fair amount of IP related to CT.  Not only would an acquirer get a great set of assets, they would also acquire some decent IP which they would otherwise have to try to design around
In terms of multiple – we think XDC could probably get 1.25x asset value.  As a reminder, 1.0x = roughly $5.00 per share.  1.25x NAV would equate to roughly $6.60 per share or more than a double from the current price level. 
Are there recent data points which suggest that in an M&A deal an acquirer will pay a premium to NAV?  The answer is yes.  For instance, Pioneer Drilling (Ticker: PDC) just bought Go Coil for $110mm.  Go Coil is a collection of 10 CT rigs (7 onshore, 3 offshore) that are pretty new (2009-2011 builds) and medium spec (1.25” to 2.00” coil).  Our diligence suggests the original cost of this fleet to Go Coil was between $55mm and $70mm.  We’ll get a more precise understanding when we see how much goodwill hits the PDC balance sheet after Q1.  But regardless, we have one recent data point of an acquirer paying at least 1.5x NAV for an attractive set of assets.
Why invest in XDC and not some other North American focused drilling company?  Aren’t there other companies trading at discounts to NAV?   A core element this investment thesis revolves around XDC trading at a significant discount to NAV.   With this in mind – we still want to make sure we are buying high spec, best-in-class assets.  This is because we don’t want to invest in some old, low quality assets that are temporarily making money just because current rates are solid (e.g. old dry bulk vessels in 2007).  Instead, we believe there is margin of safety to owning the newest, highest quality assets because they will typically garner the highest utilization rates even in a down market.  Whereas, older and lower quality assets may sit idle and have much more tenuous long term value.  Having said that, it is rather rare to find best-in-class assets trading at a meaningful discount to NAV.   When we do see this (as in the case of XDC) we are typically quite intrigued.   
Summary
Owning best in class assets at a 40% discount to year-end NAV provides a solid margin of safety
There are a number of reasons to think this gap will narrow or disappear completely (implying a $5.00+ share price)
New XSR rigs (after painful delays) are finally on a clear deployment schedule.  And, the first units are already demonstrating their operational outperformance in the field
Capex cycle is slowing, net debt should peak in 2Q, then debt reduction will commence
Optically the performance will continue to improve as the high spec drilling assets start to earn their keep
There is some chance that Management / Core Investors seek to sell the company (resulting in a $5.00 to $6.50 transaction value)
The history of the Founder / CEO suggests he is more of a ‘build and sell’ type of guy
There are a large number of potential buyers who would love own these new, best-in-class assets
Core holders likely view a sale as the best and only realistic way to realize up their investment

Background
CXW will convert from REIT to C Corp in 2021.  It is an owner and operator of prisons and re-entry facilities.  It also owns a portfolio of office buildings leased to government agencies.  The office portfolio is non-core and will be sold to pay down debt.
  Federal agencies (ICE, BOP, USMS) represent slightly more than half of revenue, with ICE being the biggest customer at 29% pre-COVID. State agencies account for the rest of the business.
  Before the impact of COVID, prison accounted for 85% of net operating income (NOI), re-entry accounted for 5%, and office for 10%.
  The business is leveraged to occupancy.  CXW is compensated on a fee per person per day basis and generally contracts come with minimum occupancy clauses. 
  Prisons have high operating leverage and private prisons are the marginal supply.  In other words, public facilities tend to be filled up first before detainees are sent to private facilities.
  Business Quality
High Barrier to Entry
Due to local opposition and NIMBYism, getting the required approval and zoning to construct a prison is very difficult.  It is harder for government agencies to build because their incentives are not purely economical. For instance, USP Letcher was first proposed in 2005 and it was canceled, after 14 years in negotiation, due to local opposition.
  Another barrier comes in the form of existing relationships and track record.  Since the demand for private prisons primarily is to ease overcrowding, completing a project on time or having available capacity with short notice is very important.  Government decision-makers are comfortable with CXW as it has a track record that spans decades. It also has idle facilities that can be ramped up quickly.  New entrants face a chicken-or-egg first dilemma.
  Cost Advantage
Due to inefficiencies and bureaucracy, government constructions are often delayed extensively and over budget.  CXW can build cheaper and in a timely manner.
  Opportunity
CXW provides mission-critical services to the US government with high barriers to entry.  It is trading at a depressed multiple on near-trough earnings (6.9x LTM EBITDA).  
  The last time it traded in the 6 - 7x range was before the last U.S. presidential election in 2016.  More specifically, the stock price was cut in half when then US deputy attorney general Sally Yates pledged in a public memo that private prisons would be eliminated in the federal system.
  My bear case scenario assumes 8x trough EBITDA (additional 16% decline from 2Q20 EBITDA annualized) which implies the stock is worth $6.9 or 16% downside from $8.25.  
  My base case assumes 10x normalized EBITDA (selling the non-core office portfolio at cost to repay debt, capturing half of the NOI lost due to COVID) vs GEO at 10.4x LTM EBITDA. My base target price is $20.2 or 145% upside. CXW should trade at a premium due to a better balance sheet and growth profile.
  There is a near term catalyst less than 40 days away (election on Nov 3).  For those uncomfortable with the election, I suggest a pair trade - long CXW and short GEO - to hedge the headline risk.
  Why does this opportunity exist?
There are three reasons that are transitory or one-time in nature: COVID, C-Corp conversion, and the presidential election.
  First, COVID created a perfect storm.  It slowed down the justice system.  With courts closing which in turn postpone hearings, and loosening parole supervision (parolees checking-in on phones instead of face to face), admissions to prison plunged. Some prisoners were released to ease overcrowding.  Re-entry facilities were also temporarily closed.  
  Furthermore, the US-Mexico border shutdown decreased ICE daily population from more than 37,000 in March to less than 21,000 in September.  As a result, prison and re-entry NOI declined $27mm yoy in 2Q20.
  Second, management disclosed the company will convert back to a c-corp (it became a REIT in 2013) and suspended the dividend in June.  The unexpected dividend elimination caused many income-oriented and REIT investors to sell.
  Third, pre-COVID, Trump was expected to win reelection given his strong record on the economy.  Nonetheless, the pandemic has made Biden the frontrunner.  The Democrats favor the abolition of ICE and private prisons. Sentiment on private prisons turned extremely negative in anticipation of a Biden administration.
  Investment Thesis
CXW is a play on 1) post-COVID normalization, 2) replacement of obsolete facilities opportunity, 3) success in deleveraging and 4) improvement in occupancy driven by higher crime and hardening public opinion
  Post-COVID Normalization
COVID dragged down ICE population due to closed border and prison population due to shutdowns of courts and social distancing in prisons which have a cascading effect on prison population. For example, prisons have stopped taking admissions from county jails.  As a result, compensated man-days were down from 5.9M to 5.3M year-over-year in 2Q20.
  The main reason for illegal border crossing is income disparity.  As long as the incentives for illegal immigration remain intact, illegal crossing will resume and ICE detainee numbers will recover.  I also expect the economic disparity between the US and Latin America would become wider post-COVID. 
  Courts were shut down due to COVID which created a backlog of unheard cases.  This drag is temporary as courts have now reopened, and the early release of prisoners due to social distancing is largely over. Admissions should normalize, driving up compensated man-days.
  Replacing Obsolete Facilities 
Old facilities are more expensive to operate and maintain than newer ones.  Overuse causes excessive wear-and-tear and premature deterioration.  Public facilities have been over-utilized since the 1980s.  
  Below is a chart of the age of BOP facilities.  30% of BOP capacity are over 50 years old.  The number is likely higher at state facilities due to tighter budget constraints at the state level.
  According to the latest data available, public prisons had 1.35M detainees in 2018, not counting county jails.  Assuming conservatively that 30% of capacity needs to be replaced, this is a 405,000 beds opportunity.  CXW has 77,722 beds including idle facilities. 
  The Lansing facility is the first ever private-owned, public-operated project pioneered by CXW.  Recall that private prisons are compensated for occupancy like hotels. The new structure is more like a traditional property lease in which CXW owns the property and is responsible for maintenance.  Government agencies enter into a long term lease with annual escalators and operate with their own staff.
  The benefit for CXW is lower earnings volatility.  The benefit for government agencies is zero upfront payment and a better balance sheet for state budgets.
  The Lansing project, which was completed early this year, replaced a 150 year old facility with 8 - 9% unlevered returns with 20 year lease term. It was a landmark deal.  CXW is in exclusive negotiation with Alabama for two facilities.
  GEO cannot compete in this market with its current cost of capital. CXW is uniquely positioned to grow post c-corp.  Private equity cannot come in due to the barriers to entry.  I believe Mr Market has assigned zero credit to CXW and incorrectly priced GEO at a premium to CXW.
  Success in Deleveraging 
There is a perception that CXW has trouble accessing financing as several banks pledged to cut ties with private prisons. First, I believe the banks are virtue signaling.  Given the amount of liquidity available, CXW has no problem refinancing its debt.  At worst, I expect CXW to pay 10-20 bps more than similar credits. Second, as shown below, CXW has enough liquidity at least until 2023.
  Before the dividend suspension, the stock was trading below 5x FFO.  Clearly, the market isn’t giving them credit for the dividend.  It was effectively locked out from the capital markets because 1) borrowing more during a pandemic and when revenue is contracting is suicidal, 2) as a REIT, all earnings have to be paid out as dividends, and 3) cost of equity is prohibitively expensive and thus new projects are uneconomical.
  Therefore, converting back to c-corp is the right move because it allows CXW to retain earnings.  Management has stated their first priority is to deleverage. 
  Debt due before 2023 is $351mm, with $293mm due in 2022. The company has $364mm cash on hand and an office portfolio fully leased to government agencies that it paid $385mm for.  The office portfolio can probably be sold at a premium given the decline in 10 year treasury yield (150 - 250 bps contraction) relative to time of purchase.
  Assuming $50mm maintenance capex, no improvement from 2Q20 EBITDA, and 21% tax rate, FCF to equity is $213mm/yr.  
  Cost of equity should come down as CXW demonstrates it is not at the mercy of the debt market.  If the market does not give credit to the deleveraging, CXW can buy back 22% of its current market cap with FCF to equity per year.
  Improvement in occupancy driven by hardening public opinion
Inmate populations peaked in 2009.  Population in private prisons peaked in 2012 and had outflows in all but one year since. The decline is due to lower crime, bail reform and gentler sentencing.
  I believe the perception of criminal justice reform has inflected and the political wind has changed - many Americans feel the pendulum has swung too far.
  The number of murders is up 28% in major US cities year-over-year. Reported violent crime is flat.  Since violent crimes and murders are highly correlated, this suggests underreporting of violent crimes because It is hard to hide a dead body/missing person.  But victims of other violent crimes might fail to report the crime due to distrust of police, depression related to lockdowns, or the increased prevalence of mob justice.
  Furthermore, videos of people looting and engaging in violent acts in public, inflaming headlines such as “The feds can’t save New York from the insane no-bail law” and the alleged association of mob violence with BLM protests add credence to the “crime wave” narrative. 
  According to Gallup, 8% Americans think Crime/Violence is the most important problem in September, up from <0.5% in May and double from 4% in August.
    Biden and Pelosi have changed their tone drastically relative to August, publicly condemning violence which indicate their internal poll numbers show public opinion favors “hard on crime”.
  What does this mean for prison population trends? 
New York State epitomized how quickly politics can change. There were about 20,000 detainees at the end of 2019.  Bail reform, which eliminated cash bail for most suspects, was passed in 2019 and implemented at the start of 2020.  It quickly reduced the number of detainees from about 20,000 to 15,000 within 3 months.
  In February, the NYPD alleged bail reform is the cause of a rise in crime – before covid and George Floyd – and along with negative press coverage, turned public opinion.  Politicians reacted just as quickly, amended and tightened the reform law in April.
  This is a turning point: Politicians cannot appear to be soft on crime.  They will respond to public opinion and take a tough stance against crime to endear voters. I believe the trend of prison population will bottom in 2020 and start growing in 2021.
  Biden Presidency
If Biden wins, sentiment will turn more negative and stock will sell off.  In a worst case scenario, I assume Biden is serious in eliminating private operators from the federal system.  There are two separate implications: 1) USMS and BOP,  2) ICE.
  USMS and BOP
While the headline is scary, the implication is actually positive. The federal government cannot confiscate private properties without compensation like Argentina or Venezuela. The detainees are arrested due to criminal offenses. 
  This means there are only two options: 1) purchase facilities from CXW, or 2) convert federal contracts into the private-owned, public-operated model like Lansing.
  For option 1, I expect the purchase price will be close to tangible book. The stock is trading at 0.72x.
  For option 2, the stock will re-rate as 23% of revenue will become de-risk.  The multiple should converge with net lease companies with exposure to government like DEA which is trading at 19x EBITDA.
  ICE
It’s important to note that “abolish ICE” is an idea endorsed by several candidates in the primary.  Biden never endorsed the idea.
    He has vowed to stop detaining asylum-seekers, effectively reviving catch-and-release. The table above shows the average daily population (ADP) of ICE in September.  If Biden keeps his promise in the most progressive ways tomorrow, releasing ALL non-criminals detainees, ICE population will decline by 6,000.
  CXW’s ADP from ICE was around 11,900 in 2Q20. The minimum guarantee from ICE is 8,600.  Even if CXW holds all the asylum seekers, an unrealistic pessimistic assumption, it would mean a decline of 28% compensated man-days from 2Q20 level.  In terms of revenue, the decline would be 7.8%
  I estimate ICE-owned facilities can handle 5,000 ADP.  County jail held 7,000 ADP for ICE in the latest 12 months.  In a normalized year, there would be 22,000 criminals and suspects held by ICE, which means it would still need an additional 10,000 beds.  
  Assuming CXW can capture 5,000 beds, compensated man-days would decline 58% from 2Q20 level.  CXW revenue would decline 16% from 2Q20 level.
  Valuation
  Upside to the base case
Recapture more than half of NOI lost due to COVID 
Office portfolio sold above cost basis; 10 year treasury yield is 150-250bps lower than the time CXW bought the properties.
Reinvestment of retained earnings
Occupancy increase driven by tougher on crime stance
As CXW executes, it should trade at a premium to GEO due to lower leverage and higher organic growth.
  Risks
State budgets will be in horrendous shape post-COVID; spending on correctional service can be cut as healthcare and education are higher priorities. 
  Politicians continue to go softer on crime and prison population continues to fall. 
 I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

  Sangoma Technologies (CVE: STC) is a neglected micro cap that operates in the high growth VOIP industry.  Sangoma is a consistently profitable firm (posting positive net income for 26 out of the last 27 quarters) that currently trades at nearly 2x earnings net of cash with a variety of catalysts to unlock value and increase profitability.
  Business Overview:
Sangoma is an equipment provider to the telephone communications industry.  Their main line of business involves selling products that allow PC servers to communicate with legacy telephone networks and Wide-Area Networks (WAN).  The product lines include both hardware and software solutions.  Some of Sangoma's products include:
PC network cards that  convert phone calls from legacy PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) to VOIP
Software that telemarketers use to detect when a human answers the phone
Transcoding cards that compress voice signals to save bandwidth
  The largest growth opportunity for Sangoma is within the unified communications industry.  Products like Sangoma's Net Border Express facilitate the move towards PC-based telephony by converting phone signals into computer processed VOIP transmissions.  The value proposition Sangoma provides to this market is best understood through an example.  Suppose you are a startup business and need to form a call center to handle returns and customer complaints.  Rather than paying through the nose for a full service proprietary technology to handle your needs, you go to Sangoma and purchase an A104 card for $1,400 (amazon.com).  With this card you can turn any PC into its own call center, routing calls, playing hold music, and recording conversations for quality assurance.  Businesses can utilize a variety of applications like Skype to efficiently and cheaply manage these centers.
  Financials:
Even if the potential growth prospects for Sangoma's products don't pan out, you are still paying very little for a reliable, profitable company.  A summary of the last six years are shown below:

  Strengths:
Founder and chairman of board owns 20% of the company.  New CEO William Wignall was granted options to acquire 6% of shares out.  While this grant may be overly generous, especially since the options were struck at a favorable price, it certainly aligns his interests with shareholders.  In the past, Wignall has proven himself dedicated to maximizing shareholder value, as the last two companies he led were bought out.  He also helped initiate a normal course issuer bid for Sangoma less than 3 months after being appointed CEO.
  Downside protection from book value - tangible book value is $14.4mm (of which $7.5mm is net cash).  Total liabilities of $1.5mm (including interest free loan of $100k from Canadian govt).
  STC announced a buyback program to acquire up to 5% of the shares outstanding by Dec 2011.  In the first quarter of its instatement, the company repurchased 193k shares or ~14% of shares traded.
  Sangoma has a few new products in which it has invested over the past few years that are just launching, and could provide additional revenue upside.  These include: NetBorder 3.0 and STC's D100 and D500 transcoding cards.
  A potential opportunity for STC is their deal with HP.  In early 2010, STC announced they had entered into an OEM partnership with a ""major computer networking supplier"" to supply them with STC's NetBorder Express Gateway.  Sangoma announced they expect this relationship to ""generate several million dollars of revenue over the next few years"".  Although the specific partner/product had never been named, strong evidence points to Sangoma's products being used in the HP Blade (see http://blog.tmcnet.com/blog/tom-keating/voip/sangoma-and-hp-partner.asp).  This product's launch has been delayed due to setbacks in the release of Microsoft's Lync software (finally released in late 2010) and could provide additional upside when launched.
  Risks:
Revenues/profitability lumpy on a quarterly basis
First 9 months of fiscal 2011 have been a little weak due to FX losses, increased R&D  (many new products have just been launched, the effects of which have not yet hit the top line significantly), and slightly light revenues
Stock is very illiquid
  Conclusion and Valuation:
Given management's shareholder friendly mentality and strong equity incentives, I think full credit for the cash is merited.  A fair valuation for the shares should be more along the lines of 10x $2mm earnings + $7.5mm net cash = $27.5mm market cap or over 120% upside from current levels.  Given the high growth industry they operate in and their strong competitive position, one could argue a heftier multiple is merited.  Downside protection is provided by tangible book value of $14.4mm, of which half is net cash.

Payless Shoesource, the nation's leading retailer of shoes, sells for 4.7 times EBITDA and 6.8 times after netting out sustaining CAP EX. Using traditional LBO economics, the company generates an after tax Internal Rate of Return of 35% per year at the current price. And, the company is gradually taking itself private, having repurchased nearly half of its outstanding shares in the last 4 years. This is a cash flow machine.

The major problem with Payless is its modest growth potential. The base business can only grow about 3% per year. It is adding new outlets through an outsoucing arrangement with Shopko, whereby Payless is managing the Shopko shoe departments. And, its Parade of Shoes operation is showing modest promise. Nevertheless, this is not a fast growing business. However, the excess cash flow generation (all of the earnings are free cash flow) can continue to be used to buy back stock. If all of the roughly $120 million in free cash is used to repurchase stock, the company can retire nearly 11% of its shares per year without taking on any incremental debt. On top of the 3% top line growth, this generates EPS growth of 14% per year. With a highly capable management team that has guided this business to remarkably stable margins and high returns on capital employed in a tough economic environment while succesfully competing with the likes of Walmart, one can rest assured that the Payless brand is a true franchise. With the stock selling for only 9.5 times estimated 2000 earnings, this is clearly worth a look.

Idea: Long Sacyr Vallehermoso (Ticker: SCYR SM)
Thesis: Sacyr is a Spanish construction conglomerate. It is an unloved business that has transformed itself recently without most noticing. Sacyr had been in trouble for a few years when its stake in Repsol was requiring other assets to be pledge as well. Eventually Sacyr sold a property business to repay a lot of the debt associated with the Repsol stake. Meanwhile Sacyr has a fantastic concessions business that is only now ramping up. Using a Sum-of-the-Parts valuation metric gives me a target price of €4.6 compared to €2.2 currently.
Company information:
Sacyr is a Spanish conglomerate with 4 major segments, construction, concessions, services and industrial, as well as significant holdings in non-operating assets primarily a 8% position in Repsol. The construction, services and industrial businesses are cyclical and all are coming off recent troughs, and hence are still experiencing trough margins, while the concessions business has long-term visibility and is fairly resilient. This results in the concessions business producing the majority of the EBITDA and cash flows despite having a small revenue contribution. Sacyr’s non-core holding in Repsol has also recently recovered from the multi-year oil downturn. 
Since these businesses are largely stand-alone, they will be investigated separately.
Sacyr Concessions
Sacyr Concessions is a leader in the management of infrastructure such as motorways, hospitals, transport hubs, etc. Sacyr Concessions has 36 assets in 9 countries, with 27 already operating and another 9 under construction. Most of the debt on Sacyr’s balance sheet is project finance debt related to the assets under construction in this business. 
The business has shifted from being 70% Iberian, to less than 40% of revenues coming from Spain/Portugal and all the growth is coming from Latin American projects. Infact the backlog is now more than 70% international, so in future the business continues to diversify further. 
The Chilean and Colombian exposure has grown in the midst of a slowdown (in Chile) and recession in Colombia. Both the countries are now recovering and growing faster on the back of a recovery in the commodities (copper, oil etc) that their economies are levered to. 
The business’ backlog has been rapidly growing and increased 40% y-o-y in 1H 17 to €17,126m. This represents more than 31.2x the current concession revenue indicating strong growth in the business as a number of these projects start getting completed. The business has been capital constrained in the past due to turbulence in other businesses for Sacyr, and had to turnover assets (like sale of Portugal business etc) to fund growth but should be on more stable footing going forward. 
There are a number of projects that are currently being valued using the equity method and they are not accounted for in this backlog, including the concession in Italy (Pedemontana – Veneta), the Mar 1 motorway in Colombia, and the Rome-Latina freeway which has a 43 year concession with a backlog of €12,250m. 
Due to the high number of projects that have just been completed and are in ramp-up phase, the business has been a bit misunderstood. The construction sales (at almost 0% EBITDA margin) ramped up initially as the projects were being constructed but these have started to wind down and projects are launched and concession revenue ramps up. The concessions themselves will take a few years to achieve run-rate revenues. All this has meant overall business sales haven’t grown, and while EBITDA has been ramping up, it’s been from a low base. In addition the business has not thrown out a lot of cash so far but all this is set to change going forward. EBITDA will continue to ramp up, as will earnings and cash flows. 
Note below comparable metrics for peers below:
Since Sacyr Concessions is smaller and at a much earlier phase in development, it will be growing earnings, EBITDA and FCFs considerably faster than its peers. Using Earnings or EBITDA or FCF, Sacyr Concessions should be given a slight premium to these comparables. 
In addition Sacyr hopes to ramp up to 15% ROEs similar to ROEs of Atlantia and Vinci but behind Abertis’ 25% ROEs, and hence should achieve a similar P/B multiple of 2.8x. But since Sacyr still needs to ramp up its BV per share growth, a discount to this multiple is more appropriate at this stage. I have used a 1.5x P/BV. 
Using all these metrics gives a range of valuations for the business and I have taken the average of these metrics.
  Sacyr Construction
Sacyr Construction is an infrastructures company that handles all kinds of projects across the world: civil construction, motorways, underground and railway, buildings, airports, ports and hydraulic infrastructure. Construction is performed through the head units Sacyr Construction in Spain and Chile, Somague in Portugal, and SIS in Italy. The business suffered massively from the vicious downturn in the Spanish and Portuguese construction sector after the financial crisis and the European crisis. Spanish and Portuguese activity and backlog have collapsed, leading to decline in margins. 
The company has tilted this business to international opportunities and now 85% of the backlog is international. But the continuing decline in the Spanish business, which only now appears to be levelling off, has continued to weigh heavily.
As the Spanish business stabilizes and the international business continues to recover, allowing a recovery in margins, 2017 is likely the trough year for the EBITDA of the business. Considering it’s the trough year, it would not make sense to value the business on this year’s EBITDA. More appropriate is to apply the appropriate 4.5x multiple (that ACS trades at for 2018E EBITDA) to Sacyr’s 2020E EBITDA and discount the value for two years at close to its WACC of 10%. 
Sacyr Industrial and Sacyr Services: Valoriza
Sacyr Industrial is present in Spain, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Chile, Bolivia, Panama and Mexico, and is the result of the integration of various companies. It comprises of the following business areas:
Engineering and energy: Sacyr Industrial is one of the leaders in the Spanish energy sector, and it is also a pioneer internationally in conventional and renewable power plants, in cogeneration plants, and in the development of biomass, solar energy and geothermal plants. It also operates and maintains power plants and industrial facilities.
Environment and mining: Sacyr Industrial is one of the leading international companies in the design, construction and operation of waste treatment and waste-to-power plants. It also has experience in mining and processing plant projects.
Oil&Gas:  Implementation of refinery, chemical and petrochemical, gas handling and treatment and liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects, and the transportation and storage of this type of fuel.
Electrical facilities: Engineering, development and the construction of high-voltage electricity lines, electricity substations and low-, medium- and high-voltage facilities.
Sacyr Services consists of services provided by Valoriza, with a presence in Spain, Australia, Algeria, Portugal, Chile and Oman, and specialising in the management of the following services:
Environmental: which consists of 
Municipal services: Leader in management of concessions in the main Spanish towns, street cleaning, collection of municipal solid waste, gardening and maintenance of green areas, management of parking meters and towing services.
Waste treatment: Builds and operates plants to treat municipal solid waste, packaging, and batteries, treatment facilities for construction and demolition debris and landfill gas removal, and plants for biomethanation, incineration, and waste-to-energy production, as well as facilities to treat, compost, and thermally dry the sludge from wastewater treatment plants.
Regeneration: this area encompasses water quality control, atmospheric control and recovery of landscapes and woodlands.
Water: which consists of 
Engineering, development, construction, maintenance and operation of all types of water-related plants (drinking water and water purification plants, desalination plants, tertiary treatments and recycling, industrial waste water treatment, agricultural treatment, etc.) 
End-to-end management of the water cycle under public sector concessions or in the private sector.
Multi-services: provided through the following companies: 
Valoriza Facilities: Group company specialised in the integral cleaning of buildings, facility management services, ancillary services (porter services, gardening, etc.), energy and social-health services.
Valoriza Conservación de Infraestructuras: Group company that specialises in the maintenance and upkeep of roads and other specific infrastructure: dams, irrigation channels, etc.
Cafestore: Group company specialised in the operation of motorway service areas (third leading Spanish operator in this market), and in the management of restaurants and cafeterias at large facilities: hospitals, transport hubs and public and private buildings.
These business have similar characteristics, similar to other business services companies out there. Since each of the sub-sectors can be lumpy, it’s best to combine the two businesses financials and forecast joint revenues/EBITDA. The combined divisions have been growing at more than 20% over last two years. The growth rate has been tapered to single digits in the forecast. 
Using a 8.0x 2018E EBITDA multiple that has been growing at 20%+ for two years, is very reasonable
Non-operating assets
Sacyr has two significant non-operating asset stakes. A 15% stake in Itinere Infrastructures, which is accounted for as “held for sale” within the concessions business, and a 8% stake in Repsol. 
Stake in Itinere Infrastructure
Itinere Infrastructure is a concessions business. Although it’s a private company it does publish its accounts. It owns a number of motorways in Spain as shown below. 
It’s key figures are shown below. All of its motorways are experiencing healthy traffic growth.

Stake in Repsol
Sacyr owns a 8.05% stake in Repsol, the integrated oil and gas company. Repsol is a listed company. In three stages in Sep 2016, Dec 2016 and then in April 2017, Sacyr pre-sold forward contracts of 20m shares at €10.7, 30m shares at €11.92, and the remaining 72.2m shares at €10.9 respectively. At the same time it purchased call spreads to retain control and upside in the business. 
Repsol has given detailed calculations in its annual report what it considers to be the “value in use” or intrinsic value of the Repsol shares and won’t consider selling them below this value. This is why it held on to the Repsol stake as it had to pledge more assets on the debt secured to the Repsol and eventually sold its property management business Testa to reduce the debt. 
  Repsol has a fantastic downstream business that held up very well even as oil price crashed, and cushioned the overall business. Repsol hence has sustained its earnings and cash flows and is currently one of the cheapest on a P/E or EV/DACF basis. 
  Meanwhile oil has gone into 6 month backwardation for the first time since April 2014, indicating a tightness in the spot market. This has been caused by surprising uptick in demand driven by broad based global gdp growth and stronger EM demand growth in particular. 
Repsol has also yet to respond to the recent rally in oil and is likely lagging it. It’s upstream business has a breakeven of mid-40s while its downstream business continues to be very resilient and is performing well. Repsol is likely to strengthen further from here closer to its peers EV/DACF average, which will take Repsol to €17.5, 15% or so higher than here. I assume current trading price as base case and my target price for high case. 
GUPC Claim
In 2010, Sacyr bought a 48% stake in Grupo Unidos por el Canal, S.A., which held the contract to install the third set of locks in the Panama Canal. GUPC completed the project in May 2016 and the locks were operational in June 2016. 
The project ran well over the budget. GUPC claims that multiple changes in the design, change in physical conditions (mass balance), disruptions, material costs and other factors led to the project running over budget and it is claiming the excess amount from the Panamian Govt. GUPC filed for claims totalling $3,953m. As the offical Dispute Adjudication Board (DAB) is proceeding slowly with reviewing the claims, GUPC has moved the case to the ICC’s Arbitration Court in Miami. 
According to Sacyr, the independent expert DLF Associate, Ltd. updated the report analysing each claim on Feb 2017 and establishing a fair estimate of the amount that the company can expect from each. Its conclusion is that the company should reasonably expect to recover $1,954m. As $338m have accrued to date, a further $1,616m are pending collection. Sacyr is due a share of 41.6%, and therefore can reasonably be expected to recover $672.4m. This value has not been used in the base case valuation. I have not used any amount in base case as the timing is completely uncertain and hence only used this amount for the high case. 
  Sacyr valuation
Putting together all the valuation on Sacyr, the base case yields a price more than double, while the high case yields a price almost triple. Even the low case is 70% higher. 
It’s very likely that the intrinsic value is higher than the base case as Repsol is likely to trade up from here given recent Brent price action, and there’s likely to be some, albeit not all, recovery from the GUPC claim. My target price would be closer to the high case of €6.7 but some patience is required. Either way, current trading price of €2.2 makes no sense. 
As a catalyst, Sacyr has mentioned its own valuation of intrinsic value in Repsol in Dec 2016 annual report to be between €16.3 and €17.2. In its June 2017 update it recalculated this intrinsic value range to €14.8 to €16.0. Hence it’s likely that Repsol will soon be above the value that Sacyr has itself declared below which it will be unwilling to sell. Sacyr has not disclosed the upper end of the Call Spread it purchased above which it does not receive any benefit from Repsol share rally, but it did mention that it is above Book Value which is €18.8 for Repsol. Hence it’s possible that Sacyr decides to sell the Repsol stake when it’s trading in the €17-18 range.

Gladstone Investment (GAIN) is one of several BDC’s brought low by the combination of market turmoil, uncertainty, in general, about venture debt investments, and recent rights offerings. It also suffered an unexpected stumble in the senior syndicated loan market. But at 6.40/share, it is trading at a remarkable discount (43%) to NAV and providing monthly distributions to shareholders at a rate of 15% on the current share price.
  First, the book value: on March 31st, the end of GAIN’s fiscal year, NAV was 12.47/share. A subsequent rights offering in April added 5.52 million shares at 7.48/share (40.6 million net), for a new share count of 22.08 million and an adjusted NAV of 11.19/share. Making no assumptions about changes in security values since 3/31, market price is at a 43% discount, wide by any measure.
  As to the current .08/share monthly distributions, some is return of capital. In FY ’08, out of a slightly smaller total annual distribution, .79/share came from net investment income and .15/share was return of capital. The final quarter reported 21 cents in net investment income, so investment income is rising as new sub loan and mezz debt investments are funded by sales of lower paying senior syndicated loans. Of course, at the current discount, return of capital is arguably desirable (if they’d only distribute all the capital!)
  The portfolio of 42 (at 3/31) senior secured syndicated loans proved an embarrassment to Gladstone. After GAIN’s 2005 IPO, proceeds were “parked” in these securities so that investment income could be earned while control/affiliate investments were sought. This supposedly safe and marketable asset class encountered unexpected turbulence, and by March 31st the portfolio, $154 million at cost, was underwater by $23 million, a substantial nick against the value of the 16.5 million shares then outstanding. A few issues have been sold since, creating realized losses, but it would be reasonable to assume that the overall portfolio has strengthened a bit, as the end of March marked one of the low points (so far) in syndicated loan values. These loans must be up ~ 4-5% since then.
  Gladstone hasn’t helped the share price with the current proxy seeking shareholder approval for, among other things, issuing new stock below NAV. If approved, this would be another way, besides rights offerings, of raising new capital. This one may not pass. It requires 50%+ affirmative votes of both outstanding shares and votes cast. Abstentions and broker non-votes count as votes against. Since GAIN does not seem to face liquidity issues (it applied the $40 million recently raised to borrowings under its credit line), a “no” vote on this proposal may help the stock. In any case, the company would be foolish to issue shares in this environment, and David Gladstone said as much on a conference call to discuss the proxy resolutions. But he wants all his options open for the future and is feeling stung by the extended volatility and share price impact arising from the rights offering.
  The recent pay down of outstandings under a $200 million credit line leaves about $100 million in debt. The remaining portfolio of syndicated loans is worth $120+ million and is relatively liquid. Total assets at 3/31 were $336 million. Leverage is still modest with a coverage ration of 243% before the rights offering and better than 300% after. BDC’s are required to maintain at least 200%.
  David Gladstone, himself, is a very important factor here, of course. There are other BDC’s selling at big discounts. Round291 called him an “investment legend” in a late 2005 write-up, and although he has had some PR bumps since leaving Allied Capital, he has a reputation for ability and success, to say nothing of experience. He went slow on making new control investments for GAIN, thinking EBITDA multiples were too high for the buyout & recap financings of middle market companies GAIN is aiming at. He has much better opportunities now. Probably he wants to remove any reputational dents arising from GAIN’s early disappointments. He owns 175,000 shares and ought to be buying more.
  The history of BDC’s, in general, is not particularly inspiring, but GAIN may have the right combination of investment talent and discount to make it an attractive holding over the next couple of years. Being paid to wait certainly helps.

Despite having more than doubled since a writeup last year (we owned it then too), SLM remains an extremely compelling investment at current levels.  Sallie Mae is a $5.5bn market cap leading provider of private student loans (PSLs) in the US with $5.7bn of annual loan originations. The company carries a dominant >50% share in US PSLs, a market that grows mid- to high-single digits annually and is occupied by relatively few players. The company’s unparalleled brand recognition and attractive channel dynamics within the PSL market drive 20%+ ROEs and close to 5% NIMs. Sallie Mae is well-capitalized and has a defensive loan portfolio that is 86% cosigned by parents and carries an average FICO of 749 at approval.
Despite these attractive characteristics, Sallie Mae trades at less than 6x 2021 EPS guidance. Investors have largely stood on the sidelines due to perceived political risk, concerns about increasing indirect competition from student loan refi players and late cycle / COVID-induced credit risk. While these concerns have mostly subsided over the past year, shares remain depressed and are backstopped by the significant asset value of the private student loan portfolio.
Investors have downside protection compared to broad-based bank indices with much lower ROEs. The company’s <6x 2021 EPS multiple compares to ~12x for the S&P Banks Index. Downside protection is further enhanced by historical whole loan sale transaction precedents, with recent private loan sale prices implying the value of the company’s loan portfolio at $16 per share and meaning that investors get the originations engine for only $2 per share.
A company with >50% share in a market growing MSD to HSD and similar returns on equity would easily trade at 20x+ earnings in this market. To take advantage of the large share price discount, the company is aggressively repurchasing its shares in the market and will repurchase 30%+ of the company in just two years by the end of 2021.
  Business Description
Sallie Mae, based in Newark, DE, was originally formed almost 50 years ago as a GSE. The company came into its current form after being privatized and later separating from Navient Corporation (NAVI) in 2014. Sallie Mae kept the bank and the private student loan origination engine (including the brand) as part of the separation while Navient kept the vast majority of the FFELP and existing private loan portfolio, the federal servicing business, the outstanding debt and the litigation liabilities associated with the pre-spin servicing practices.
Since the spin, Sallie Mae has been re-building its balance sheet and now has $29bn of assets, including $20bn of loans, funded by $21bn of deposits, $5bn of debt, $2.1bn of common equity and $0.25bn of preferred stock. $19bn of the net loans are PSLs, but the company also holds $0.7bn of legacy FFELP loans. Management is testing credit card products in addition to student loans, but credit cards should remain a very small portion of the overall loan mix (only $11mm outstanding today).
The PSL loan portfolio is quite defensive because of its high cosign rate, high FICO score at approval and college educated borrower base. Normal net charge-offs are in the ~1.2% range.
The company has strong capitalization ratios with a CET1 Ratio of 13.7% and a Total Capital Ratio of 14.0%, implying that the company carries more than $800mm of excess capital on balance sheet above the buffer to regulatory requirements.
Sallie Mae’s loan portfolio has also shown extreme resilience throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, with net charge-offs flat at 1.2% from 2019 to 2020 and management expecting NCOs to increase to only 1.5% in 2021. Many borrowers were granted periods of disaster forbearance during early 2020 to ease the repayment burden during the height of the COVID-19 crisis which caused forbearance to peak in the mid-teens as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance. The company stopped providing disaster forbearance in June 2021, and forbearance (as well as delinquencies) are now at multi-year lows. Management has been consistently conservative on charge-offs throughout the pandemic, with 2021 charge-off guidance now at 1.5% after previous guidance of 2.5% after 2Q20 earnings, 2.3% after 3Q20 and 1.8% after 4Q20 and 1Q21. Part of the reason for the conservatism was to account for the expiration of the federal student loan moratorium on 9/30/21, but that moratorium has since been extended through the end of January 2022.
  Market Overview
The private student loan market grew at a ~7% origination CAGR over the 5 school years from ‘14-’15 to ’19-‘20, supported by consistent increases in tuition, fees, room and board (TFRB) costs and annual enrollment growth at 4-year schools. TFRB grew at a 3.3% and 3.0% CAGR over the same period for private schools and public schools, respectively. While overall college enrollment is declining due to the declines in for-profit and 2-year institutions, enrollment at 4-year institutions (Sallie Mae’s core market) grew at +1.6% CAGR from 2014 to 2019. Demand for private student loans also tends to be countercyclical, with enrollment accelerations seen in the previous two economic downturns and state subsidies and family contributions typically declining in times of economic weakness. The strong PSL market growth trends should continue post-pandemic, driven by annual increases in the cost of staff and continued expansions in services provided to students.
Student loan underwriting is unique relative to other types of loans because lenders are essentially underwriting the credit quality of 18-year-olds who don’t start repaying the loans until after graduation. As a result, private student lenders typically require parents to cosign the loan so that they are also on the hook for repayment. These loans are originated primarily to fund education at 4-year institutions, are split about 50:50 between students at public and private schools and are issued to households with an average of ~$100k of family income.
PSLs are often mistakenly viewed as similar to federal student loans, but their origination and use is quite different. PSLs represent only 2% of overall spend on higher education annually and are used as “gap financing,” meaning that they are taken out to fund the remaining portion of college costs after parent and student funding, grants, scholarships and federal student loans are applied. Stafford Loans, the most common federal student loans, have an annual maximum that limits typical borrowing to $27,000 cumulatively over four years. After students have exhausted federal loan borrowing, they turn to private student lenders to cover the remaining cost.
  Competitive Landscape
Sallie Mae owes its dominant >50% share position largely to its unrivaled brand, which is synonymous with student loans, and the attractive channel dynamics in the private student loan market. The company’s significant brand value and channel positioning is best illustrated by originating almost 3x the student loan volume of Discover, the next largest competitor, despite Discover sending almost 5x number of mailings.
Students and parents tend to wait until the last minute to figure out school funding, and parents are the ones who usually make the decision on which provider to use. Most borrowers only submit one loan application before deciding on a provider, further entrenching players with the strongest brands like Sallie Mae. Rather than being a price competitive process as one might expect, student loan borrowing decisions are typically made without significant comparison. Sallie Mae’s name still carries the trust of a government entity for many borrowers which also helps support the company’s disproportionate share.
  Financial aid recommendations are still often made by college financial aid departments, and US schools generally keep a preferred lender list (“PLL”) which parents and students access when deciding on a student loan. Schools with PLLs undergo an RFP process every 2-3 years and decide which lenders to include based on reputation, experience, customer service, interest rates, terms and approval rates among other criteria. Financial aid officers are fairly risk averse and tend to shy away from adding lenders with unproven (think SoFi) or negative (think Navient) reputations in order to protect student borrowers. Any potential new entrants will struggle to penetrate the channel of financial aid offices, but with the largest sales force in the industry and decades of experience, Sallie Mae appears on 98% of PLLs.
An indirect competitive pressure that investors often flag is the risk of increasing prepayment speeds because of student loan refi players, mainly SoFi and Earnest (owned by Navient), refinancing the higher credit student loans into lower rates. The ideal loans for these players are from borrowers that carry large debt balances but have very low risk profiles, like loans held by a doctor with $200k of medical school debt. Smaller check size and higher risk undergraduate PSLs don’t generate the same ROI for the refi players, but these loans are still subject to consolidation. The headwind from this competitive product is likely to abate over time as competitors face a shrinking TAM and potentially compressing spreads if interest rates rise. While student loan refis are likely to continue to grow, Sallie Mae’s financial profile is relatively insensitive to changes in refi growth.
  Wells Fargo Market Exit
In the wake of the pandemic, Wells Fargo, an originator of ~$1bn of private student loans annually, announced a plan to leave the PSL market completely at the end of the 2020-2021 school year. They later announced plans to sell their existing loan portfolio to Apollo and Blackstone which closed in the first half of 2021. We expect Sallie Mae to capture at least half of the Wells Fargo volume over time which would increase Sallie Mae’s origination volumes by 9% from 2020 levels.
  Valuation and Potential Returns
Sallie Mae trades at just <6x 2021 guided EPS of $3.20 and ~7x our estimates of a more normalized 2022 EPS, a discount to the broader S&P Banks index which trades at 12x 2021 EPS. Sallie Mae’s ROEs, share position and sustained market growth likely justify at least a mid-teens P/E multiple which would imply a doubling in the company’s share price.
Given the implementation of CECL distorted bank provisioning and increased the volatility of GAAP earnings, we prefer to look at EPS by adding back provision expense and then netting out after-tax charge-offs to get to a “cash” EPS on which we value the company. We also view Sallie Mae’s EPS as two separate income streams: one EPS stream from the existing business and one from the recurring gains on sale of loans. If you believe that the loan sales are truly recurring, then you might value the gains at a similar multiple to the rest of the business. We take a slightly more conservative approach, valuing the gain on sale EPS at only 5x and the rest of the business at 15x. Looking out to YE 2024, this approach implies a valuation of 12.5x on 2025 “cash” EPS and implies a potential IRR of 37%.
  As explained in further detail below, recent private market loan sales also add downside protection, with the existing book almost worth the entire stock price at current private market valuations.
  Loan Sales and Capital Return
Although equity investors don’t seem to fully appreciate the value of Sallie Mae’s portfolio, private market credit investors have shown a willingness to pay significant premiums for a piece of the company’s loan book. After recognizing this disparity, management announced a substantial capital return program in 2020 in which they sold $3bn of loans to private market investors for an ~8% premium to face value. Sallie Mae used the capital generated from the gain on sale in combination with the release of the reserves held against the loan portfolio to fund a $525mm accelerated share repurchase, ultimately repurchasing 14% of shares outstanding in 2020 alone.
The recent loan sale activity, including the sale of Wells Fargo’s portfolio, brought a lot more buyers to the marketplace as private credit investors increasingly understood the product. The strong demand allowed management to continue to build on the loan sale and capital return strategy in 2021 by completing the sale of an additional $3.16bn of private student loans and recording a $399mm gain on sale at a 12.6% premium. That loan sale was 8x oversubscribed, and we expect the company to have no issues continuing the annual $3bn loan sale over the coming years to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity.
The 2021 sale, in tandem with another $1bn coming in Q4, will fund a $1.25bn share repurchase in 2021. Close to $1bn of stock was repurchased in the first half of 2021 through the combination of a tender offer and a 10b5-1 program, and $295mm of capacity remains under the current authorization. If the remaining $295mm is repurchased at current prices, it would imply a share count reduction of 20% in 2021 (PF for the final 2020 ASR shares) on top of the 14% reduction in 2020.
Investors commonly ask why Sallie Mae doesn’t further accelerate the loan sale. Further demand exists in the credit markets, but the limiting factor is actually the time that it takes to return such significant amounts of capital to equity holders. Unused capital generated from loan sales that sits on the balance sheet creates a drag on both earnings and NIM, and the company is trying to balance timing of loan sales to avoid that issue.
The opportunity to own a company that will repurchase >30% of its common shares in two years is obviously quite rare, especially for a business that has >50%+ market share of a market growing MSD to HSD.
Further, the recent private market loan sales highlight the significant downside protection in the stock today. If the remaining loan portfolio were valued at a similar premium to the 2021 loan sale, the existing loan portfolio alone would be worth $16 per share, implying only $2 per share for Sallie Mae’s origination engine and preeminent brand.
    Leadership
In early 2020, Sallie Mae announced that Ray Quinlan would step down and Jon Witter would take over as CEO. Jon most recently served as Chief Customer Officer of Hilton, but he has extensive experience in the banking industry having served as President of Retail and Direct Banking at Capital One, as COO of Morgan Stanley’s Retail Banking Group and as Head of General Bank Distribution at Wachovia. Jon has committed to focus on the core PSL business, manage expenses appropriately and maintain the loan sale and capital return strategy. Since joining, Jon divested the lower-quality personal loan portfolio in late 2020, reduced operating expenses by 8% when compared to 2019, accelerated the capital return program and led the company through the COVID-19 crisis with only a minimal increase in NCOs.
  Risks
Key risks often highlighted by investors include potential regulatory changes to the US student loan market, competition from new entrants like SoFi and Navient and late cycle or COVID-induced credit risks.
The main potential political risk that investors focus on is the concept of “free college,” a misnomer that in practice would likely include means-tested free tuition at in-state public schools and would not include room and board which makes up ~50% of 4-year public school costs. The current administration seems to have no appetite for offering free four-year college, and the Build Back Better higher-ed reforms are currently focused on free community college, Pell Grant expansion and subsidized tuition for some students at HBCUs, none of which would materially impact Sallie Mae. Even if a free 4-year public college were to be implemented, the impact on Sallie Mae would be relatively minor. Half of Sallie Mae’s loan originations are to students at private schools who would not be eligible for the tuition-free benefit. Out of Sallie Mae’s student loans issued to students at public schools, more than half of the loan volumes are to students that are out-of-state and also likely would not be eligible. The remaining <25% of loan volumes would likely be subject to some sort of means test which would further
reduce the pool, and management has indicated that free tuition would only hurt originations by 10% after means testing. Since Sallie Mae earns revenues from the balance of its overall loan portfolio and not from originations, a reduction in originations does not necessarily even translate into a reduction in revenues for the company. Sallie Mae’s balance sheet is still small relative to the size of its origination pool, so the company would still have grown its private student loan balance by 10% in 2019 even if originations were 10% lower.
Investors were previously more focused on competition from SoFi and Navient, but neither company has made much progress in the in-school student loan market. Sallie Mae has actually gained market share since Navient’s non-compete expired at the end of 2018.
While credit risks are always a concern when investing in a bank late in an economic cycle, Sallie Mae’s strict underwriting standards and low NCOs provides credit downside protection as evidenced by performance through the COVID-19 crisis.

India Globalization Capital (IGC)
  India Globalization Capital (IGC) is a SPAC targeting infrastructure companies in India.  The company is led by a very strong CEO who has negotiated two simultaneous majority control stakes in Indian E&C companies for 22.1x TTM earnings.  While this multiple seems high both targets are positioned for outstanding growth with fully contracted revenue that will surge 8-fold from historical FY March 2007 to FY March 2009.  As explained below, IGC believes it can use its cash to dramatically improve the profitability of these companies.  These efforts allow us to purchase IGC for 7.1x FY March 2009 earnings which is a substantial discount to the 21.0x multiple of the public Indian comps.  A 17.5x forward multiple implies that IGC has 100% upside on a fully diluted basis (where we punitively assume the company raises cash through warrants at $5.00 then instead of deploying that cash productively it immediately buys back the stock at a higher price).  Given the growth opportunity here I believe this investment could provide much greater returns over time as the company is also planning a foray into owning infrastructure assets such as toll-roads as well as alternative energy power generators like wind-farms.  This equity will also have scarcity value since there are few options for American investors who want to play the Indian infrastructure theme.  From a timing perspective, these deals took a long time to get through the SEC and IGC’s liquidation deadline is March 8th so the vote will take place on February 20th. 
  Industry Overview
  It is an understatement to say that rapid economic growth in India is predicated on improved infrastructure. India’s GDP is growing 8-9% per annum and the country expects to spend $475 billion on infrastructure in the next 5 years.  This figure includes $40 billion for highways and $160 billion for power generation.  IGC’s initial platform companies will focus on both roads and power generation.  This infrastructure boom could last up to a decade. 
  The road network in India is clearly inadequate and cannot handle the traffic demands of its rapidly growing economy.  Though India has approximately 2 million miles of roads, most of its highways are subpar.  They are narrow and congested with poor surface quality.  According to the World Bank, approximately 40% of India’s villages do not have access to all-weather roads and are cut off during the monsoon season.  Remarkably, in the last 50 years, the government has built only 334 miles of 4–lane roads.  All these facts suggest an outstanding tailwind for the companies IGC plans to back. 
  There are three types of road building contracts:  maintenance, third-party road building and Build Operate and Transfer (BOT).  BOT is a government mechanism common in infrastructure initiatives that can attract private investment as well as rapidly build out world-class roads.  A participant will fund the construction of the project, such as a toll road, operate it for a specified period such as 20 years and then transfer the asset back to the government.  As I will detail below, IGC will focus its early efforts on executing simple road building contracts but will also endeavor to build out a portfolio of BOT projects. Maintenance will also provide an ongoing revenue stream to the company.    
  Business Description
  India Globalization Capital is a SPAC that raised $62.8m in March 2006 to acquire an operating business in India.  The driving force behind the company is Ram Makunda, a very smart former telecom entrepreneur who has ties to India.  In speaking with Ram I get the sense that he is on “our team” and that he will make good decisions.  This is a far better quality manager than you might expect in an emerging market micro-cap company.  Both the final merger proxy dated 2/8/08 and the investor presentation filed on 2/1/08 can provide additional information beyond what I supply here.  The proxy is very helpful.  
  IGC is buying 63% of Sricon and 77% of TBL for $40m.  Sricon and TBL are infrastructure companies that specialize in road maintenance and road building, in India.  Buying majority stakes in Indian companies is no easy task and it is important to note that the current management teams of the target companies are still sufficiently aligned to grow their businesses.  IGC actually announced a previous LOI with another roadbuilder called MBL but it was too difficult to get US GAAP audited financials completed so IGC moved on to Sricon and TBL.  Prior to termination of that deal, IGC did a bridge financing for MBL which it now carries as an asset on its balance sheet.  Similarly, IGC has already done a $7.2m bridge financing for Sricon and TBL to build momentum for their pipelines.  After completing the deals, IGC will still have $19m on its balance sheet for further acquisitions or incremental investment into its initial targets.  In pursuing these deals, IGC noted that most of its competitors were focused on offering $5-$10m for smaller ownership stakes in Sricon and TBL while IGC’s willingness to step up with significant capital was a key differentiator.  The most interesting aspect of the deals is the exceptional backlog that provides top-line visibility into FY10.  The proxy breaks out the backlog by project.    
  Sricon is an engineering and construction company that is engaged in the execution of civil construction and structural engineering projects. It has $195m of project backlog.  It is involved in the design, building and maintenance of roads, highways, toll booths, overpasses, as well as industrial infrastructure development such as power plants, water supply systems and mining.  Sricon also has a BOT contract for one of the highways in India. This is important because it shows that the company has the skills to execute on a BOT.  A significant portion of the business is categorized as “industrial logistics” which entails contract mining for excess rock as well as transportation of coal and ore.  This segment is a 25% margin business.  The industrial infrastructure segment offers a 15-17% margin while the road building business is more of a 5-6% margin (with opportunities to earn a higher margin by vertically integrating back into a quarry to reduce aggregate costs).  Sricon’s CEO had 30 years of experience for Larsen & Toubro before founding the company in 1997.  In addition there are 300 skilled employees and 800 unskilled labor contractors. 
  TBL (Techni Bharathi Limited) is also an engineering and construction company that is engaged in the execution of civil construction and structural engineering projects, such as the design and building of roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airport runways, railroads and dams.  Its project backlog is $47m.  TBL has a regional focus in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.  It is also experienced in Assam which is a mountainous Northern region where the difficult terrain and occasional political instability mean contracts are extremely profitable.  TBL is run by a father-son team who previously founded Bhagheeratha  Engineering and took it public as one of the 10 largest construction companies in India. TBL was founded by the chairman's son.  The chairman retired from Bhagheeratha engineering several years ago, before the boom.  However, after he left it was taken over by another family.  The company still exists but is not one of the larger companies. TBL has 57 skilled employees and 70 unskilled labor contractors. 
  The key insight that IGC brings to these transactions revolves around the immediate increase in net profitability by injecting capital into these two businesses.  IGC believes several straightforward changes can improve net margins from 3-5% to 14-18%.   As can be observed in the financials in the next section, neither of these companies have grown in the last few years and they have both been marginally profitable or loss-making.  IGC cites numerous benefits from shoring up the company’s balance sheet and providing it with an American sponsor.  These improvements fall into three categories:
  First, the companies can save 500bps by improving their payment terms.  In the past, the companies did not have the cash to pre-pay or even pay on time for raw materials.  Adequate capital provides leverage with vendors that increases purchasing power.   IGC has had detailed discussions with vendors and other construction companies and is confident that obtaining these terms would not be a stretch. 
Second, the companies can improve margins by 300bps by investing in PP&E and improving productivity.  Specifically Sricon could invest in a crusher that would allow it to make its own aggregate.  Leasing rates can be 18% in India so it makes sense to borrow at a lower rate and purchase equipment.
Finally, the companies expect to improve margins on the order of 500-700bps through a reduction of the cost of capital.  They expect to reduce their interest rate from 13.5% to 9% by improving their balance sheet and Ram also believes he can access less expensive lending sources in the United States and Europe.  He has had discussions with RaboBank, Citi, JP Morgan and HSBC for example.  In addition, he has hired a consultant to help raise the debt.
  Due to the holding company structure, IGC believes its two infrastructure companies will be perceived as local, but it will also benefit from being an American company.  This will give it the local advantage to partner with governments on projects that may not be as easily available to the Bechtels of the world.  Yet the company will also bask in the prestige of an American listing and will obtain an American cost of capital. 
  For the medium term these companies will be run separately. However, IGC will be able to exploit certain synergies: (1) IGC will organize a joint-risk management committee and the companies will share equipment where geographically appropriate; (2) there will also be scale in project bidding as IGC estimates a 1 in 7 win rate on projects and plans on bidding 2/3 a month; and (3) longer term IGC may combine Sricon and TBL then take that entity public in India. 
  Also in the long term, IGC would like to build a portfolio of 100% owned assets such as BOT projects.  It is also moving into the power generation business.  As part of this transaction, IGC will purchase a 24-megawatt wind energy farm to be built by an engineering firm called CWEL. According to Ernst and Young, 60% of India’s population has no electricity and even major cities face power cuts.  It is expected that CWEL will take between 9 and 12 months to build out the wind energy farm.  Due to the timing of the initial contract to build it, the construction cost is 25% less than it would cost to replicate it now.  The wind energy farm will serve as a platform for future growth and acquisitions in the alternative energy sector in India.  Ram also believes he will be able to run the business tax-free for 10 years and potentially sell carbon credits to further improve the economics. He has initially budgeted a 30% ROE.  I have marked the wind business at the book value of the cash invested as it will not be up and running for a year. 
  Financial Summary and Valuation:
  The following chart lays out the fully diluted capitalization of IGC.  In addition to the typical SPAC common shares and warrants, there are additional shares and warrants associated with two bridge financings.  IGC has a 7% stake in MBL, another roadbuilder not involved in this transaction, through a convertible bridge financing that it did back when it thought it was going to invest in MBL.  This is held on the balance sheet at $3m. While this is not in the proxy, Ram states that MBL will do $80m of revenues this year and its net income will be $5m.  Capitalizing this investment at 20x implies a $7m value which I have backed out of the valuation.  I have also backed out the book value of the wind business, although it is arguably worth more.  Though it is conservative, I have assumed that the $19m of excess cash on the balance sheet does not get deployed.  There is a substantial warrant overhang which I have addressed by quoting all valuations as fully diluted treasury method.

  The following chart lays out the historical and projected financials of the target companies.  All financials are US GAAP.  Sricon’s projections through FY 2010 are based on the lower of proxy or earnout targets through 2010 while 2011 and 2012 represent simple 15% growth which I feel is reasonable.  TBL’s historical financials exclude a one-time gain while 2008-2009 projections are based on the presentation which has lower numbers than the earnout targets in the proxy.  Years 2010 through 2012 are based on earnout targets.  I have included all earnout shares as if they are earned to calculate IGC’s share of net income.  Note that the earnout shares are not in IGC stock but rather in the stock of the individual companies. There is further detail in the proxy that I have chosen not to delve into here.   I would also add that the company has hired a consulting firm of ex-PWC accountants to supplement the existing internal finance team make sure controls are adequate and there is never an issue with the numbers. 
  The most recent six month period show a significant uptick in the business level that is in part due to a bridge loan from IGC, but also reflects the fact that IGC’s commitment to invest once the deal closes allowed the companies to receive soft loans to push execution up.  Together, this is early evidence that IGC’s investment will drive much stronger performance going forward.  There are also no BOTs in the projections though these projects can offer 25-30% IRRs.  It is possible that the company could benefit from BOTs in FY 3/10.
  Finally, these projections do not include any benefit from either the $19m of cash on IGC’s balance sheet or from warrant proceeds which are incorporated via the treasury method.  In reality, investing this cash in the business should be extremely accretive.

It is also worth noting that Noida Toll Bridge, a company not in the comp list,  is a $250m market cap pure BOT company that trades at 36x 08 EPS and 29x 09 EPS which a premium to the other comps.  Should IGC be successful in building-out a BOT portfolio then it would raise its valuation.

                  The following tables show the potential value of IGC at more reasonable multiples as well as if it was market to the average comp valuation.  As 3/08E is essentially trailing and does reflect the large ramp in revenues and improved profitability, 3/09E is a better period to reflect this investment’s potential.   I feel some discount is warranted as it is a holding company and has yet to fully execute on its projections.

            From a downside perspective, IGC’s revenue is locked-in for FY 3/09 but if it is unable to achieve its margin improvement goals to the tune of a 700bps difference from its projections then their EPS would be $0.34 in FY 3/09.  At a depressed 7.5x multiple after taking into account the $1.90 of cash and other assets, the stock would trade to $4.40 implying 25% downside. 
  Investment Concerns
  Trust Buyers Could Hold Up the Deal: As in some other SPACs, there is a large trust buyer presence in the shareholder base.  These funds arb the spread between their purchase price and the cash in the trust of $5.89.  Looking at what happened with the MQC deal (which I previously wrote up), there is a chance that management might have to cut a deal at the last minute and offer some of its shares to investors who step  up and bring the deal across the finish line.  I will keep the VIC community abreast of that situation in the event it is necessary and takes place.  The deadline is March 8th so all of this might happen in short order.   
  SPAC CEO’s prior experience includes a bankruptcy:  Ram founded one of the first ethnically-focused international long distance telecom carriers back in the 1990s called Startec Global Communications.  The company IPO’ed on the NASDAQ in 1997, generated $300m in revenue and turned a profit.  At its peak, its market cap exceed $1 billion.  Ram was approached to do a convert which ensnared the company in a liquidity crisis as the tech boom imploded.  Ram led the company through a long restructuring which ultimately returned all the senior debt’s capital.  Interestingly of the 25 public companies with similar business models, only 3 survived including Ram’s company.  His model worked but he got in trouble on the capital structure.   The two main items I take from this is that 1) Ram is an honorable individual who committed himself to a multi-year painful restructuring to get his lenders their money back and 2) I think it is unlikely that Ram will allow any venture he leads to find itself in a liquidity crisis again. 
  CEO is New to Industry: Ram has excellent business judgment but he is new to the industry.  He has spent a year digging into MBL before passing on that opportunity and he also passed on two other similar companies. I have not met other management at the target companies.  They have strong backgrounds, however, and I suspect they will remain the key operators post-deal. 
  Lots to Execute: Taking a step back, it looks like hyper-growth is a lot to ask of two tiny companies, particularly as it relates to bid activity for new projects.  In reality, its quite doable.  It takes 4 people to create one bid team.  One team can bid on two contracts per month.  Collectively, IGC’s targets have three teams in place now (two in Sricon and one at TBL).  IGC expects to put together one more team.  Ram believes that getting more contracts is the smallest risk, because of the number of contracts available and the inroads that these companies already have.  Rather, the keys are a strong balance sheet, technical qualifications which the companies have (they are pre-approved to bid on contracts up to $116m), and adequate contacts/influence.
  Margin Improvement on the Come: As simple as the margin expansion sounds here, it still needs to happen.  The market might not be willing to reward the company with a full multiple until it posts a few quarters of solid financial performance. 
  Indian Economic Risk:  Future growth is dependent on the Indian government following through on its spending programs.  I think India will continue to spend and IGC investors are well protected by its backlog and its valuation. 
  Holding Company Structure: Given that IGC is a holding company, it may trade at a discount.  On the plus side, it is a majority shareholder in Sricon and TBL so their financials will flow through the IGC P&L. 
  DISCLOSURE:  We and our affiliates are long India Globalization Capital and may buy additional shares or sell some or all of our shares, at any time.  We have no obligation to inform anybody of any changes in our views of IGC.  This is not a recommendation to buy or sell shares.

Energy Recovery (ERII) first came to our attention courtesy of an earlier VIC write-up by Woolly18 in May 2016. It is worth revisiting that write-up for history and context if this idea interests you. Woolly18 traded this one quite well with an entry price of $10.90 and an exit price around $6.50 only 15 months later. Today the share price is back around $10. In the interim, ERII has failed to deliver on milestone testing for its key growth product after nearly four years of trying, its CEO exited in February 2018, it switched accountants in May 2018, and it has used a revenue recognition rule change and one-time tax benefits to engineer quarterly ‘beats.’ We think ERII sets up attractively as a short position.
  SHORT POINT #1: The Water division’s growth is tapped-out, the current cycle will turn south, and ERII has been unable to operate profitably even with an attractive market environment.
  ERII operates in two divisions – Water and Oil & Gas. The Water division primarily sells the PX Pressure Exchanger and related products into desalination plants. The bulk of its revenues – 84% for Q2 2019 & 82% in FY 2018 – comes from the sale of products in its Water division. The Oil & Gas division makes up the remainder of the revenues. The Oil & Gas revenues come through a 15-year exclusive licensing & development deal ERII signed with Schlumberger (SLB) in October 2015.
  The products sold into the desalination market carry 60-70%+ gross margins, and there are over 20,000 PX Pressure Exchangers installed around the globe. The PX Pressure Exchanger carries a 25-year life with no maintenance, per company materials. ERII’s Water division appears to operate in an attractive niche. There are two issues worth reviewing with the Water division: 1) the PX Pressure Exchanger has saturated the desalination market, and the current up-cycle in the industry will turn south sooner rather than later, and 2) ERII has not found a way to be consistently profitable despite its high product margin.
  Unsurprisingly, the company loves to talk about its revenue growth and its gross margin profile since 2014. It looks impressive at first blush. The global desalination market operates in 4-6-year cycles per ERII management, and 2014-to-present has seen several desalination mega-projects go into service. The company has seen its revenue go from $30M at the bottom of the cycle to run rate $70M for FY 2019. However, it would be an error to codify $70M as the new steady state for the business. As previously mentioned, the PX Pressure Exchanger has a long useful life and it requires no maintenance. The launch of new mega-projects in the desalination industry will not continue unabetted, and ERII is likely to see Water product revenue growth turn negative as the cycle turns. The industry is not the secular growth engine that some investors have been led to believe. Even if we make generous assumptions surrounding the ongoing growth of the Water division, and we assume higher profitability levels than ever achieved by ERII in its Water division, it’s still nowhere near enough to justify the current $10 share price. The water business alone is too small and too lumpy to justify ERII’s current share price & valuation.  
    On the profitability front, ERII’s expenses have consistently outpaced revenues and gross profit. General and administrative expenses come in at more than 30% of revenues and they have grown at 2x the rate of revenues over the past 10 years. R&D expense increases have been the other big driver of higher operating expenses in recent years. Bulls will argue this R&D ramp is a positive sign of things to come, but we think the R&D spend is largely related to the already announced VorTeq development and not towards new, unannounced products that could offer incremental returns. In other words, this R&D spending is only lessening the profitability of the already announced SLB agreement by adding expenses to a fixed-revenue stream. It is also interesting to note that sales & marketing expenses have declined both as a percentage of revenues and on an absolute basis despite the substantial growth in revenues in the past 5 years. Perhaps the sales & marketing team was bloated, and the current, streamlined team is much more efficient? Or perhaps some expenses have been liberally reclassified from sales & marketing to other P&L areas like R&D?         
    The company represents segment operating profit for its Water division at north of 50%, but we think that figure substantially underrepresents the expenses related to that portion of the business. ERII generously attributes a near 50/50 split in G&A between the Water and Oil & Gas divisions, despite the revenue split being 80/20, while also claiming Water is responsible for almost none of the R&D budget. The Water business historically required R&D spending in the range of 10%+ of revenues. How is it that Water R&D shrank to almost nothing once the Oil & Gas business division showed up in the financials? Regardless, ERII cannot seem to translate the supposed attractiveness of the Water division into attractive corporate financials. It is like those E&P companies that represent 100%+ IRRs on individual wells and then have negative corporate ROIC.   
  SHORT POINT #2: ERII has been unable to complete basic testing milestones for its VorTeq hydraulic pumping system after nearly four years of attempts.
  Back in October 2015, the company made headlines with a seemingly attractive and potentially lucrative agreement with Schlumberger (SLB) to begin revolutionizing the hydraulic fracturing process with ERII’s VorTeq hydraulic pumping system (link). VorTeq’s novelty is that it routes harsh chemicals and proppants away from pumps, and this routing results in less pump breakdowns, reduced costs, and increased uptime capability for the entire fracturing system. How was this pressing problem not already solved by all the engineering talent working in the oilfield? Shouldn’t Schlumberger and Halliburton and Baker Hughes have figured work arounds and other solutions to this issue already? You would think so, but maybe it just wasn’t a high priority and ERII capitalized on a gap in the market. ERII subsequently introduced the MTeq mud pumping solution for the oil & gas industry. These product introductions allowed ERII to shift the narrative in their business from market saturation to market opportunity (see slide below from June 2016 investor presentation).
    The deal with SLB was an exclusive 15-year agreement that provided ERII with an upfront payment of $75 million and 2 subsequent $25 million payments upon the VorTeq system hitting development milestones (Milestone #1 and Milestone #2). Milestone #1 is a 5-stage fracture at a SLB testing facility. Milestone #2 is a 20-stage fracture performed at a well in the field. Nearly four years into the deal, neither milestone has been met. There have been a variety of technical and engineering challenges along with a supposed testing facility delay. Management and sell-side analysts have offered explanations and excuses, but it all comes down to the VorTeq not being able to perform in lab-like scenarios, much less real-world conditions. One of the more frustrating issues surrounding the development of VorTeq is SLB’s silence on the agreement despite ERII’s failure to deliver on milestones that were supposedly low hurdles. We attempted to get an update from SLB, but they refuse to comment on the arrangement. The SLB deal was the impetus that propelled ERII shares from the $2-$6 range where they spent the entirety of publicly traded life to $10+ in anticipation of a new growth market for ERII.
  ERII’s original language suggested the VorTeq would roll out by year-end 2016 across SLB’s fracturing fleet. It was inevitable. The prior CEO, Joel Gay, was extremely promotional and was the prototypical over-promiser/under-deliverer that short sellers love to find. His conference calls were wonderfully entertaining. Unfortunately, he left without explanation in February 2018. The new CEO was the prior CFO. He’s been more reserved in his public comments, aside from saying “the shorts will get theirs at some point.” Notably, both the VorTeq & the MTeq are “currently in R&D stage” per the May 2019 investor presentation, which is surprising to hear since back in 2016 ERII was launching VorTeq into full commercialization imminently. What’s happened here?
      ERII recently acquired land and began construction on a manufacturing facility in Katy, TX to take control of the VorTeq testing process. The facility, when completed, is supposed to house VorTeq testing and other oil & gas product opportunities. Still, we have nothing to suggest that the VorTeq is ready for working in the field (aside from management comments of course). Even if we assume the VorTeq is commercially viable, then there’s a roll-out timeline and manufacturing-at-scale issues. ERII originally touted its licensing plan as a capital-light avenue to monetize its intellectual property without taking additional manufacturing and operational risk. With the opening of the Katy, TX testing facility, ERII is now shifting its strategy and it will indeed incur incremental manufacturing and operating expenses. Not to mention ongoing R&D spending for a product that still does not work.
  Let’s assume that ERII solves the remaining VorTeq issues and the product is launched into the field with SLB’s approval soon. What revenue/profit might ERII achieve even in that scenario? ERII guided to $80-$200 million in annual revenues once SLB fully deploys the VorTeq across its entire fracturing fleet (see slide below). Let’s give the desalination business credit for a $70M/year run-rate as the new normal instead of it being a cyclical high point. That puts ERII at $270M in annual revenue on the upside. SLB sits at the top of the oilfield service food chain and it earns 20% EBITDA margins. Halliburton (HAL) generates high-teens EBITDA margins. Let’s give ERII the benefit of the doubt and assume they can run similarly to SLB. That gives ERII $54M in EBITDA by 2022 at the earliest, which means ERII is trading today at nearly 9x that imagined 2022E EBITDA figure. SLB trades for 9.6x 2019E EBITDA and HAL trades for 7.3x 2019E EBITDA. Maybe the milestones are met and the desalination business continues to grow, but it sure seems like ERII is getting a lot of credit for years of solid execution when the reality is that the company has failed to produce a working product nearly four years into the agreement.   
  SHORT POINT #3: Recent revenue growth and EPS beats have been driven by a change in accounting rules for revenue recognition and by one-time tax benefits.
  ERII has used a change in accounting rule ASC 606 to increase the revenues it is recognizing from the 15-year agreement with SLB. The original structure allowed for $1.25 million per quarter (or $5 million/year) to be recognized, which is consistent with the upfront $75 million payment spread out across the 15-year life of the contract. In 2018, the adoption of ASC 606 allowed ERII to recognize closer to $4 million/quarter by year-end, and the company then recast its prior financials to include higher Oil & Gas revenues being recognized from the already announced SLB agreement. These revenues are now recognized based on internal estimated calculations of the cost incurred to earn said revenue. The full explanation can be found in Note 2 on pages 64 & 65 of the 2018 10-K. This change in standard meant ERII went from recognizing $5 million/year in revenue to $8M/year in 2016, $11.1M in 2017, and $13.5M in 2018. Growth is slowing in the water product business, which is consistent with a topping-out of this cycle, and ERII is masking a portion of that slowdown with higher recognized revenues from its Oil & Gas division.      
      2017 & 2018 net income & EPS benefitted from substantial tax benefits that obscured the bottom-line profitability of the business. It’s easiest to just look at the 2018 10-K and you see the oversized impact these tax benefits had on reported net income & EPS. Notice the big benefits hit in Q4 2017 and Q2 2018.
  We’d like to believe most investors can easily see past such one-time items, particularly since Bloomberg adjusts the financials for us, but the share price reaction to the Q4 2017 and the Q2 2018 earnings releases suggests at least some investors got very excited about these earnings ‘beats’. Perhaps coincidentally, ERII changed its principal accountant in May 2018. 
  TARGETED DOWNSIDE
  The Water division valued on a mid-cycle basis with credit given for lower G&A and R&D could conceivably be worth $2-$4/share. ERII has around $1.50/share in cash as well. We think the SLB agreement ultimately gets nullified or significantly renegotiated to the detriment of ERII. In that case, ERII should trade below $5/share. If ERII successfully completes Milestone #1, including confirmation from Schlumberger, then it’s time to cover. Shares will surely trade up if that day arrives, but with shares already at $10 it seems like a lot of the SLB contract value is baked into the current valuation.  
  BULL THESIS
  The bull thesis has shifted over the years. The SLB agreement fueled a big hype cycle that had ERII applying its PX Pressure Exchanger technology into new end markets for years to come and the TAM could not get big enough. Peak craziness with the summer of 2016 when shares rallied to $16 on essentially no news absent some flimsy sell side initiations. Today, the bull thesis rests on the water desalination market being a secular bull and ERII successfully expanding its product portfolio beyond the PX Pressure Exchanger. You can review the Seaport Global research note from October 17, 2017 (the ERII initiating coverage report) and the Seaport Global research note from June 5, 2019 to get a flavor for how bulls were viewing ERII immediately following the SLB agreement and how that thinking has morphed over time. Seaport originally had a BUY rating with a $17 price target, and now they are NEUTRAL with no price target. The Iberia Capital Partners initiation from September 26, 2016 is another gem of a bull argument where that analyst team valued the water segment at $2/share and the oil & gas ‘white space’ at $19/share.  
  We have been unsuccessful in getting the folks at SLB to disclose more details around the arrangement with ERII. At one point, the bull thesis was that SLB was going to buy ERII. We think that is highly unlikely given that SLB already has a 15-year exclusive lock-up on VorTeq, assuming it does become a useful product, and the $500M+ price tag at today’s share price seems extremely high.

Lattice Semiconductor
Investment Summary:
In current markets, where we may be in a late stage cycle, we view Lattice Semiconductor as a decent business available at a reasonable price.  We believe that the underlying value of the company is not evident to the casual observer but will get clearer in coming years as reflected in the company’s P/L.  We feel confident that the company’s turnaround under the watch of a new and motivated CEO will be successful, and that an investment in shares today can generate satisfactory returns over a three to five-year period.  The following reasons bolster our belief:
The company has regained focus after a prolonged transition period while selling itself to Canyon Bridge.
High margin business with sticky customer base.
Secular tailwind in 5G infrastructure build and Edge AI.
Limited competition. The industry’s major players, Xilinx and Intel (Altera), focused on the data path and large/hyper-scale computing leaving the control path for Lattice to dominate.
New management. The company brought in an industry veteran who has revamped the entire executive team in just months after taking over, focused on its core markets and eliminating previous distractions.
The transformation has already boosted the stock price, although we believe the transformation is in its early stages and will continue for several years into the future.  
Business:   
For over 35 years, the company has focused on programmable logic devices (PLDs).  Since the acquisition of SiliconBlue in 2011, Lattice has differentiated its offerings in the marketplace with its ultra-low power and ultra-small field programmable gate array (FPGA) solutions.  Under the new leadership of Jim Anderson, the company has re-focused the business entirely on FPGA solutions and has divested non-core assets from the company’s Silicon Image acquisition.
Below is a slide from Lattice’s recent analyst day presentation that illustrates how it differentiates itself from Xilinx and Intel’s FPGA portfolio.  While the competition focuses on data path with a much larger TAM, Lattice focuses on the control path where low power, small-size, and reliability are essential ingredients to succeed.  The company has solid customer relationships with over 9,000 customers developed over several decades. A smaller TAM and stickier customer base are the reasons why Lattice can maintain its lead over its competition.
Investment Case:
Over the past decade, the company could not capitalize on its strong technical know-how, great products and, large and sticky customer base due to lack of focus and sub-par capital allocation.  The large debt due to the 2015 Silicon Image acquisition strained the company’s balance sheet. The situation was aggravated further due to the prolonged process to sell itself to China-affiliated Canyon Bridge (which did not materialize due to Trump administration’s objection).  Thanks to its technology leadership, the company was able to attract industry veteran Jim Anderson as the CEO. The following developments under the Anderson's leadership are the reasons that we are confident about the prospects of the company:
The new CEO simplified the company’s complex organizational structure and installed new leaders with industry experience to head Marketing, Engineering, Operations, Sales, and Finance.  
As mentioned earlier, the new management team changed the direction of the company by focusing entirely on the FPGA franchise and eliminated the distractions from the Silicon Image acquisition.  The revenues from the acquisition are now less than 10% of the company’s annual revenue and is on a run-off mode.
Resources were shifted by shutting down low ROI projects (and products) and moving into those with likely higher return.
Although the company has a solid customer roster, its products are underpenetrated.  The focus of the new sales head is to increase the wallet share at the largest 20 - 30 key OEMs.
In order to deepen the relationship with customers, the marketing team is visiting the top 60 customers to understand customer needs and incorporate those findings in optimizing the product portfolio. This approach has been introduced to Lattice by the current management. The company has prioritized discussions on product development with OEM's interested in learning about new products and features. For example, Amazon is a customer of Lattice and is constantly innovating to improve the robots used in its fulfillment centers. If Amazon knows Lattice's roadmap of future products, then Amazon can plan out future generations of robots better. Since Lattice can meet Amazon's future requirements, the relationship will be a lot stickier.
To further differentiate its future products and widen the lead vs competition, Lattice has re-architected its platform, adopting FDSOI technology to cut power consumption by half.  The company is enhancing its product’s software stack with new tools like SensAI to allow customers to integrate their devices with inference AI processing at the edge.  
Improved COGS and adopted a pricing optimization strategy to extract the appropriate pricing for the company’s products for the value it provides to customers.

  Within months of the new CFO's hire, the company improved its collections and increased cash generation.  Since her arrival in 2019, the company has repaid $90 million in discretionary debt, reduced interest rate expense by 250 bps, and reduced the leverage ratio from 4.2x to less than 2x. 
Sustained double-digit revenue growth and improved margins beginning 2021 due to macro industry tailwinds.
Valuation
Lattice has been operating under new management for about a year.  The company is expected to grow revenue in the single digits for 2019 and 2020.  Due to secular macro tailwinds like 5G base station upgrade and AI in industries where the company operates, revenue growth will accelerate to double digits till at least 2024.  We believe gross margins will improve to 62% gross margin and would not be surprised if gross margins rose to the high 60s like other large FPGA operators currently deliver. The company's targets for R&D and SG&A are 20% and 15% respectively.

            We believe Lattice will provide decent returns over the next three to five years period.  Although, the stock is not an absolute bargain at the current price, we would add to our position if it pulls back meaningfully.  As the macro tailwinds described earlier play out, the company’s operating margin will likely increase over 30% and our estimates could prove conservative.  We expect the investment to yield low double-digit IRR in three to five years.
  Risks
Although an investment in Lattice may work well in the long-term, investors should be aware of a few risk factors listed below: 
Industry observers believe that FPGA can potentially replace ASIC in high volume applications.  We believe this risk is likely where FPGA's utilized in data path and since Lattice does not play here, the risk is non-existent.
The main risk we believe is global slowdown in economic activity.  We believe if were to happen, the value creation may be delayed by a couple of years.
Cyclicality in semiconductor industry.
Tariff risk.
Execution risk.
Due to the restructuring underway, quarter-to-quarter financial performance may fluctuate in the short term.  Since we invest for the long-term, we are not too concerned with this risk.
 I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.
Catalyst
Continued execution will further improve margins in the near term.
Adoption of new FPGA platform by the customer base.
Migration from 4G infrastructure to 5G at the base stations will increase Lattice’s share of wallet by about 30%.
Further adoption of new generation server platforms boosts the attachment rates of Lattice products from the current 25% to 80%.
As the semiconductor content in auto and industrial automation increases, Lattice will benefit with this trend.",0.26968303447424463,0.48542740450397626,59.06147958396346,166.23515735111056,7.143179961293949,6.329761505339093,20.704889297637568,35.06762638227794
2012-10-14,dr123,PEY,Peyto Exploration & Development Corp.,https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/Peyto_Exploration_and_Development_Corp./6412931150,3551000000.0,24.68,"Description
In the past two years, a few formerly high-flying Natural Gas (NG) producers proved to be excellent shorts:  “best-in-class” NG names have mostly been re-priced to better reflect abundance of NG resources and “huge tracts of land” waiting to be developed.  UPL (3/27/2012 VIC write-up) and SWN (3/28/2012) are two notable case-studies:  back in 2009-2011 both were quality names to own for the inevitability of a NG price rally.  Our internal estimate (resulting from DCF analysis of development programs) is that at ~$50/share, UPL was discounting >$5.50/Mcf Henry Hub (HH) Natural Gas (NG) prices in perpetuity on a 2P (P50 basis) while at ~$45/share SWN was discounting >$5.00/Mcf HH on P50 resources.  Even RRC, periodic rumors of an imminent buyout notwithstanding, has materially underperformed the market over the past year and is currently discounting “only” ~$5.00-5.50/Mcf HH according to our estimates.
Introducing Peyto Exploration & Development - PEY CN (PEY) - a mid-cap E&P company holding a concentrated land position in Canada’s Deep Basin with production and reserves ~90% weighted to natural gas.  We believe that at >$24/share, PEY is more richly valued on a NAV basis than the most expensive large- and mid-cap US shale players have ever been over the past two years.  The stock has ~50% downside peer valuations and ~70% downside to our estimate of fair value at normalized commodity prices.  The company sports unusual disclosures and metrics in its investor materials including what appear to us to be factual oversights (we hope entirely un-intentional).  These oversights may leave a reader relying on these materials with an overly optimistic view of company’s financial performance, asset quality, and value.  The apparent inefficiency is also explained by primarily retail and mutual fund investor base that may have relied on the above disclosures and sell-side analysis.  The superficial sell-side coverage in turn largely relies on the company-supplied investor materials and metrics.  Valuation reflecting commodity prices far in excess of the futures curve and the marginal cost of production and limited resource upside virtually eliminate fundamental risk to the short while the roll-off of highly profitable hedges and unsustainable CapEx program provide near- and medium-term catalysts.
Peyto discounts prices in excess of $120 WTI and $7 HH on a pre-tax Proved + Probable (2P) NPV-10 basis and trades at a valuation in excess of SWN, UPL, and CHK at their 2009-2011 peaks.  What’s more, Peyto suffers from Canadian basis differentials.  Cutting through the noise of a non-technical investor presentation rich in unusual profitability and performance metrics,  we surmise that PEY’s resources are not materially more profitable than those of its peers, requiring >$4.00/Mcf HH and >$90/bbl West Texas Intermediate (WTI) prices to generate a 10% IRR.   We believe that in the $4.00/Mcf and $90/bbl WTI price environment and at recent price realizations Peyto’s pace of capital spending is unsustainable.  Finally, all of the sell-side reports we have examined included severe flaws materially overestimating cash flows attainable at projected commodity prices.
In effect, PEY provides an opportunity equivalent to shorting SWN >>$50/sh and UPL >>$45/sh today.  It is an attractive stand-alone short, or paired with just about any going-concern large- or mid-cap NG producer.  As plenty of producers continue to discount sub-$4.00 HH, PEY may be a valuable short to consider even for NG bulls looking to load up on longs while controlling NG price factor exposure.  A discussion of long-term NG price expectations is worthy of its own write-up and is beyond the scope of this note.  VIC’s CHK threads provide a good summary of what we view as sound arguments for a long-term ceiling on North American (NA) NG prices near $4.00/Mcf in real terms with some potential downside below  this level in the continued cost deflation scenario.
Valuation
Relative Valuation
While, this approach is problematic for valuing E&P companies, it does illustrate the disparity between PEY and some well-run NA producers with comparable/superior cost structures, superior market access,  and more meaningful resource exposure to a commodity price recovery as well as some of the recently challenged stories with large resource upside:

While we have not adjusted the above income figures for hedges, it is worth noting that ~25% of PEY’s EBITDA and CF is due to the impact of hedging that has provided 38% uplift to natural gas price in 2012 but should turn into a headwind in 2013 on the current futures curve limiting the upside from a medium-term NG price rally.
Another reason behind the premium valuation appears to be CFPS growth projections that are well in excess of the group:

CFPS (YoY growth, Est.)

All the sell-side reports we examined contain substantial errors (discussed below) leading to overestimation of CFPS growth by 10-20 percentage points.  Thus, actual growth is likely to be in the 20-30% range at sell-side assumed 2013 commodity prices (generally in the $3.75-$5.00/Mcf HH range).  Growth will be primarily accomplished by an orgy of CapEx that will increase PP&E by ~1/3:
CapEx (NTM)
           498
PP&E
        1,704
NTM CapEx/PP&E
29%

A 20-30% expected increase in cash flow may sound enticing.  In fact, it is underwhelming when accomplished by investing 29% of the book value of the existing assets.  In addition, the expectations include a 50% recovery in the price of the primary commodity produced by PEY.
Absolute Valuation
A DCF is our preferred method of valuing E&P assets as it captures asset cost structure, capital structure and efficiency, development capital needs, and reserve life.  PEY’s 1P reserves are not particularly conservatively booked with 42% PUDs.  We generally use the after-tax NPV-10 of Proved (1) Reserves (assuming a low PUD ratio) to value E&P assets with Proved + Probably (P50, 2P) NAV appropriate for evaluating portfolios of highly predictable drilling targets.  PEY is significantly overvalued relative to the peers even when using 5% discount rate (comparable to the company’s cost of debt) to estimate the pre-tax NPV of 2P reserves.  We begin with PEY’s YE 2011 reserve report, add the reserves from the Open Range Energy acquisition, reserves added by 2012 YTD CapEx program at historic and advertised F&D costs, and assume 40 bbl/Mcf liquids yields for the entire reserve portfolio.  These are aggressive assumptions as they ignore YTD declines, but the name is so astonishingly expensive that these simplifications do not materially impair the short thesis.  We further assume  40 bbl/Mcf liquids yield.  This is in excess of the Company’s guidance of the impact of deep-cut expansion plans (expansion yielding 35bbl/Mcf average yields, which is already included in the YE 2011 reserve report) and close to the high end achieved but the more liquid-y targets in the portfolio (Cardium).  We ignore BTU loss due to deep cut as well as increase in the proportion of low-value C2 in the liquids stream.  A more thorough analysis accounting for these would have yielded materially lower NAV estimates.  Finally, we assume the following price realizations (relative to WTI and HH), also in excess of the recent history:
Spreads (realized % of benchmark)
  Light and medium oil (Mbbl)
100%
Solution gas (MMcf)
90%
Natural gas (MMcf)
90%
NGLs (Mbbl)
80%

The above approach yields the following values assuming $90/bbl WTI and $4.00/Mcf HH:

We believe PEY shares are worth <$10/sh and current share price discounts roughly $110/bbl WTI, $5.00/Mcf HH, excluding taxes, and using a 5% discount rate.  Even on a pre-tax PV-5 basis PEY shares appear to be worth <<$20.00/sh.
Reasons for the Inefficiency
Our best guess is that this trust-like valuation is primarily due to retail ownership with institutional holders generally consisting of sleepy mutual funds holding PEY as a diversified position as well as the recent move to play NG price recovery.  Interestingly, operationally and financially levered NG producers do not appear to have generally outperformed as one would have expected in a true cyclical commodity upturn.  The performance of PEY appears to have been primarily driven by a search for “safe” ways to play NG by retail and long-only investors rather than energy players.  A review of holder reports appears to support this explanation.  The marginal buyers may not be performing independent due diligence on the name.  Meanwhile, sell-side research on PEY is some of the worst we have seen in the E&P space.  We have been pitched the name as the cheapest NG producer discounting $2.00/Mcf in perpetuity by a supposedly respectable shop, a shockingly flawed model included.  Most of the research we have seen appears to simply re-package the company’s presentation of financial performance, which appears to contain significant flaws as described below.
Presentation vs. Reality
The company has been successful in creating an image of an impeccably run shop achieving industry-leading economics.  We believe this impression is primarily due to an advantageous hedging position, the benefits of which are presented as operating in nature and sustainable.  An additional factor helping to lower the operating costs is high capital intensity (lowering variable costs by increasing capital costs).
Peyto realizes 140% of the benchmark NG price due to NGL and heat content uplift
 (10/2/2012 presentation, p. 10):
“2011A Sales Price of $5.47/mcfe = $3.91/GJ x 140%* = %5.47/mcfe”
“* 2011 uplift for NGLs and heat content from unhedged natural gas price ($/GJ) to realized effective price ($/mcfe)”
Reality:  
The uplift is due to NGL content as well as hedging benefits.  2011 A oil and gas sales ($/mmcfe) were 4.98 while realized gains on hedges were 0.48.  So the uplift for NGLs and heat content in 2011 was 27% vs. 40% indicated.  While the presentation appears factually incorrect, 2011 NGL price realizations are a pleasant memory for NG producers these days.  Arguably, including 2011 liquids realizations in an October 2012 presentation is an even more severe oversight than claiming 40% heat and liquids content uplift instead of the 27% actual plus 13% hedging gain.  The Q2 2012 reality is oil and NGL price realization at 76% of WTI vs. 86% in 2011 and NG price realization at 83% of HH vs. 97% in 2011.  At differentials slightly improved from the recent levels (to 80% NGLs, 90% NG) and at $90/bbl WTI and $4.00/mcf HH benchmarks PEY would realize ~$4.50/Mcfe.
Peyto is a low-cost producer that is profitable in a $4/Mcf NG price environment
 (10/2/2012 presentation, p. 10):
“Costs = PDP FD&A + Cash Costs”
PEY represents total costs, including capital, as $3.47/Mcfe.  The implication is that the company is profitable >$3.47/Mcfe realized prices.
Reality: 
PEY has 9 year producing reserve RLI (10/2/2011 presentation, p. 24).  The present value of gross revenue from 1Mcf of NG realizing $4.00 and produced uniformly over 9 years discounted at 10% is $2.56 and discounted at 5% is $3.16.  PEY’s latest debt raise had ~5% coupon so discount rate >>5% seems appropriate.  Using data from the presentation, at $4.00/Mcf HH price environment the pre-tax economics is breakeven at best and not particularly different from a typical liquid-y Deep Basin well or Montney, Marcellus, Fayetteville, and Woodford wells:

The above model is intentionally simplistic.  It ignores taxes since this makes comparisons to peers who generally tend to ignore taxes in their presentations easier.  It also understates the effect of discounting due to steeper initial decline of tight wells and actual production extending well beyond the 9-year RLI in practice.  We have built DCF models for PEY’s individual areas of activity (Cardium and Wilrich) and own some producers active in those areas and the above breakeven is approximately representative.  It is interesting that PEY’s is the only peer presentation without reference to production rates, typecurves, and IRRs.  Perhaps these would have more difficulty showing $2.00/GJ profit at $3.91/GJ NG pricing…
The above analysis suggests that there should be no meaningful value creation by the company in the $4-5/Mcf environment.  This is supported by the reserve report:  As of 12/31/2011 the company recorded $1,629,220K of PP&E.  Running the YE 2011 reserve report at various benchmark prices (and using the aggressive assumptions of 100% of HH NG and 90% of WTI liquids price realizations so as to reconcile more closely to the report), one gets the following NPV-10 sensitivities  The company likely needs to see >$4.00/Mcf HH to earn 10% return on invested capital, broadly consistent with the above conclusion of economic break-even around $4.00/Mcf HH price level:

  NAV is Before Tax Net Present Value, discounted at 5%, at an unspecified commodity price deck
(10/2/2012 presentation, p. 34):
“P+P NAV is PV5 DA/share.  PV5 DA/share is Before Tax Net Present Value, discounted at 5%, less debt divided by the number of shares/units outstanding”
Reality:
Given the 4.4% coupon on company’s term loan and 4.9% coupon on the recently-issued notes, yields on peer debt, and on dividend-paying peers, we need a few more rounds of QE before the pre-tax P+P PV5 becomes the appropriate metric for valuing commodity assets.  Though no information is provided on the commodity prices and realizations assumed, to get to ~$35/sh NAV, the company appears to be relying on the 12/31/2011 price deck of the independent reserve evaluator (InSite) which includes 2012 estimates of $98/bbl Edmonton Par / $3.45/MMbtu AECO and 2020 estimates of $110/bbl / $7.12/MMbtu.  These could be characterized as aggressive given the 2020 futures prices of ~$86/bbl WTI and $5.50/MMbtu HH.  Management’s value metric is worthy of recognition among the best promotions we have seen in this industry.
Reconciliation of sell-side targets to reality
Pricing NGLs on par with oil (Morningstar, some others)
Short of the various .com / social media / cloud pumps, research on PEY has seen some of the most spectacular errors and inefficiencies we have ever encountered in a mid-cap company.  Some of the gems include: “… For oil, we use $104.67 per barrel in 2012, $104.43 in 2013, and $99.07 in 2014. … we assume a 15% discount to WTI when computing realized selling prices of natural gas liquids.” We have few relationships with sell-side shops but one of the more respectable ones’ models simply used the projected WTI price for NGL realization in perpetuity in the DCF model.  In fact, in 2011 and Q2 2012 PEY has been realizing ~78% and ~66% of WTI on NGL production.  Depending on the shop, the treatment of liquids realization yields 10-30% error in NAV estimation.
Hedging impact (UBS 10/1/2012 report and most others)
UBS has one of the best reports on the name (10/1/2012) providing NAV estimates that generally reconcile to ours after accounting for taxes and SG&A.  However, even their report contains substantial errors in forward cash flow and balance sheet forecasts.  For instance, for 2013 UBS projects $60m in hedging gains (presumably copying over the number from 2012).  In reality, the company’s 2013 hedges are generally below the 2013 prices assumed in the model and PEY should realize losses instead.  This leads to >10% overestimation of 2013 CFs, and misleading liquidity picture, among other issues.
Failure to account for taxes (UBS 10/1/2012 report and most others)
Sell-side frequently values PEY CN and peers on a before tax (BT) basis.  This is somewhat defensible for a tiny name that may be able to defer taxes for so long that their present value is materially ~0, but is questionable for one of the largest producers in a basin.  In practice, PEY CN paid ~3% cash tax rate in 2011 and accrued deferred taxes at an additional 21%.  At best, assuming PEY CN grows at the current rate indefinitely, this oversight leads to an ~3% higher estimated EV.  In practice, a slowdown in CapEx that may be required given the balance sheet deterioration should lead to a maturing of the liability and an ~20% lower value estimate at high commodity prices.  There is no meaningful difference at lower commodity prices (<=$4.00/Mcf HH) where PEY CN is not meaningfully profitable.
Failure to account for SG&A (every report studied)
Given the discourse on the EQU post about the appropriate value and multiple for the recurring SG&A expense, it is interesting to note that SG&A is completely ignored in the reports of PEY CN that we have seen.  Once again, this treatment may make some sense for a small-cap that one expects to transact in the short-term but is not defensible here.  PEY’s SG&A (net of overhead recoveries from operated properties) was $26.4m for 2011 and $5.6m for H1 2012.  The average value for the past 3 years is ~$27m.  Capitalizing this at a (likely too low) 5 multiple yields $135m, ~$1/sh, or ~4% lower value estimate.
Combined (for ~50% downside), the above sources of error account for most of the delta between our and the consensus/sell-side models.  Of these, the first one is most significant and will be most vividly demonstrated as the hedges currently masking the true price realization picture roll off.  The above are some but by no means all issues with the consensus.  Generous discounting or asset performance assumptions are widespread.
Risks to the Short
Low-cost NG supply story is a giant conspiracy:   All the independent research suggesting the production-weighted average cost of recent new supply in the $3-5/Mcf range is flawed.  Markets begin to discount long-term NG prices >$7/Mcf.  We view this as an increasingly remote possibility with each new quarter of consistent data on the economics and size of tight gas resources.
Evolution of PEY to a roll-up/trust/dividend Ponzi story:  It is not a coincidence that this year saw the first acquisition in the company’s (13 year) history.  PEY should use its stock to buy-up cheap Canadian juniors.  Every issuance of shares at $24/sh to buy a fairly valued or even most overvalued assets helps back-fill the valuation pocket.  We view this as the main risk to the short.  Still, we doubt the company will embark on a multi-billion dollar spending spree that will be needed to bridge the valuation gap.  Doing so would also conflict with the story that has been sold to investors over the years and may alarm the holders.
Big new play backfills the valuation:  Concentrated acreage makes $1bn+ exploration value creation unlikely.  The current valuation at >$10K/net acre already prices-in core-Marcellus-like performance on the entire asset portfolio.

Catalyst
Catalyst 1 (0-6mo.):  As the NG markets stabilize, hedges roll-of revealing true profitability, and investors have the opportunity to reflect on the relative value of cheaper well-run peers, investor segmentation is reduced, the valuation discrepancy dissipates, PEY loses it’s safe-haven status, and gets re-priced to the peer level.
Catalyst 2 (0-6mo.):  HH reaches >= $4/Mcf and there is a robust response from the completion of NG well backlog, rigs moves back to more gassy windows of the most productive plays, coal switching outside of the Appalachia reverses, and coal power plants begin to work through their coal inventories.  Infrastructure additions in Marcellus over the coming 1-2mo. should also provide a meaningful supply increase.  Markets move on from playing the NG recovery for the 3rd time in the past few years, perhaps even beginning to discount long term marginal cost of supply near $4/Mcf HH.
Catalyst 3 (3-6mo.):  We have met with management and discussed their CapEx strategy and macro view.  We believe that in early 2012 the company was considering safeguarding the balance sheet but by the middle of the year decided to take advantage of the hedge windfall and make a bet on a rapid NG price recovery.  If a ceiling ~$4.00/Mcf materializes, the company will remain at best marginally economically profitable.  Management may choose to do the responsible thing and revert to “Plan B” cutting CapEx, production, and growth guidance to safeguard the balance sheet.  Assuming flat CapEx and barring a recovery to >> $4.00/Mcf, the company should have > $800mil in debt in 2013 – close to a prudent ceiling level given the value of their proved reserves:

Catalyst 4 (>=12 mo.):  Management continues to execute the “pedal to the metal” strategy until leverage reaches uncomfortable levels and the company has to revert to catalyst 3, but in a less orderly fashion.  BIR CN is a good illustration of how such scenarios play out.  This oath defers the return on the short but creates more ultimate downside as the company loses the aura of competence.

Catalyst 5 (0-24mo.):  Supply cost deflation continues.  Improved service costs, engineering processes, and efficiencies lead to production growth in $3.00-4.00/Mcf HH environment.  Markets begin to appreciate that this sector is no different than any other perfectly comepetetive industry in structural oversupply.

Thesis: The agency business model continues to remain under pressure from structural issues (pressure from CPG, competition from agencies, dis-intermediated from digital) and cyclical issues (risks to global ad estimates as we enter end of cycle). OMC preferred way to play short given valuation, exposure to creative and over-earning from their headcount base
1.      While structural issues are not new or unknown, like theaters they are likely to further manifest themselves
a.      CPG companies continue to be pressured, putting pressure on agency fees
b.      Competition with Accenture likely to intensify, especially if their acquisition of MDC Partners is successful
                                                    i.     While OMC (like the rest of the industry) has benefitted from the issues facing Publicis in 2016-2017 and WPP 2018 going forward, both Publicis and WPP have laid out strategic initiatives to bolster competitiveness within the industry
c.      Clients are increasingly in-sourcing projects traditionally granted to agencies, such as creative and programmatic; OMC has the largest exposure to creative, which has faced numerous issues (the first place where clients cut back spend, in addition to the fact that messaging to consumers has fundamentally changed over the past 10 years). According to Ad Age estimates, ~60% of OMC revenues are creative, versus <50% for peers
2.      Risks to global economy create outsized risk to agencies; OMC P/E went from 18x at end of 2006 to trough of 9x in 2008. Given structural issues mentioned above, P/E trough likely to be lower this time around
3.      Have continued to divest assets to boost organic growth
a.      2017 benefitted from divestiture of struggling businesses in 2017; however, 2018 organic likely to be in-line to below 2017
b.      2018, continued to divest assets that were a drag on growth (organic would be 40-50bps higher); however, creates an unsustainable way to manage organic growth
4.      Employee productivity limits upside
a.      Revenue per employee ~$200k, versus $140-$160k of peers; outperformance likely due to creative, which is typically a higher revenue and more productive business, but limits upside of further productivity compared to peers
5.      Valuation           
a.      Currently trades at a premium to peers at 13x, versus IPG 12x, WPP 8.5x (not PF for Kantar), and PUB 10x
                                                    i.     Assuming slight acceleration in organic (benefit 70-100bps from Ford, however offset from continued pressures in creative and end-of-cycle concerns) and slightly declining margins, get to EPS of $5.70 vs ST $5.80
                                                   ii.     10-12x 2019 EPS implies stock price of $57-$68, implying 10-25% downside
6.      Catalysts
a.      Q4 earnings, with clients continuing to pullback spend
b.      Slowing global ad spend (GroupM has global ad spend from 4.5% to 3.9%; Magna 6.4% to 4%)
c.      Accenture acquisition of MDC
d.      Clients reviews in 2019 (OMC biggest net winner in 2018, with second most to defend behind IPG; represents ~30bps of revenues)
7.      Risks
a.      Accelerating top-line growth from client wins and divestitures (admittedly the bar to hit Street numbers for 2019 doesn’t seem too aggressive with organic flat at 2.6% versus 2018)
b.      Agency M&A

Investment Thesis
Cardinal Health (CAH) is a high quality business with a sustainable competitive advantage.  The strength of the business is masked by issues that are transitory in nature. The business can generate at least inflation-like earnings growth over the cycle ( I assume 2.5%).  At $53.4, long CAH should provide 48% upside ($79.3) vs 5% downside ($50.8) for a risk/reward ratio of 1:9.6
  Company Description
Cardinal Health is a distributor of pharmaceutical drugs and healthcare products to healthcare services providers including hospitals, clinical labs and pharmacies.  The business is organized as two separate segments - Pharmaceutical and Medical.
  The Pharmaceutical segment distributes both branded and generic drugs, specialty drugs and OTC products.  It operates a JV with CVS named Red Oak Sourcing (to gain better scale) for generics. It also provide support services   (development, marketing, supply-chain management, etc.) and operates nuclear pharmacies and radiopharmaceutical facilities that are highly regulated.
  The Medical segment manufactures, sources and provides surgical and laboratory products.  It distributes both branded and private-label products that are generally considered more commoditized (i.e. medical gloves). 
  Why does this opportunity exist/why is CAH down?
Cordis weighed on 3Q18 results and is expected to be a drag in FY-2019
The Cordis medical device business has been struggling and was a drag on earnings.  CAH lowered its FY18 EPS guidance by 9%. The expectation is that the competition with specialized products would lower price on commoditized products to take market share and squeeze CAH.
  My Variant View
While Cordis is expected to be problematic possibly beyond FY 2019, CAH has enough capital to continue to invest and buildout the infrastructure of Cordis which would lower operating costs.  The loss was caused by inventory write-downs, which suggests this is not a recurring issue and could be work through over time.
  Generic Drugs deflation
In the last 2 years, price deflation on generic drugs led to lower profit dollar contributions, albeit the the decline in profit dollar was at a lower rate than deflation.  Management revision to “sell-side generic pricing” from mid-single-digit to mid to high-single-digit re-ignites concern about profitability.
  My Variant View
As explained in “Generic Drug Pricing” below, profitability is driven by the difference between “buy-side generic pricing” and “sell-side generic pricing”.  Deflation in “sell-side generic pricing” is a negative headline, but if accompanied by the same magnitude of deflation in “buy-side generic pricing”, profitability would remain the same.  While there are volatility, over the long term, changes in buy-side and sell-side pricing are roughly the same.
  Industry Dynamics
Pharmaceutical Distribution is highly complex and heavily regulated
The pharmaceutical distribution business is very different than distribution of typical consumer goods due to regulation and the importance of authenticity, safety and security.  If Amazon delivered a wrong laptop or missed a delivery, it would have an unhappy customer; but if drugs are incorrectly labeled or delivery is delayed, someone could die.
  The value-add of pharmaceutical distribution is to provide an essential link between manufacturers to healthcare providers
The economies of scale, investment in logistic infrastructure, supply chain management systems enable distributors to be highly efficient.  In most cases, it is more effective for providers to deal with distributors than to deal with manufacturer directly.
  Why can’t the distributor be cut off?
Distributors are trusted counterparty.  Buying from CAH/ABC/MCK comes with an implicit guarantee  of authenticity and regulatory compliance and certain level of service related to timely delivery and administrative support.  
  Beyond delivery, distributors provide additional services that are also essential to both manufacturers and providers.  These services include inventory management, compliance support, chargeback administration, order management, and product launch support. 
  Additionally, to protect the integrity of the supply chain, distributors would perform due diligence on potential supplier and customers.  The process include reviews of registrations and licenses, and may include site visits and review of historical order flow .
  The alternative of not dealing with distributors is to establish relationships, trust, familiarity and operational process with hundreds of manufacturers/providers which are time-consuming, cost-prohibitive, and practically impossible in the highly regulated industry of pharmaceuticals.
  Generic Drug Pricing
“Buy-side” pricing refers to the price that distributors pay, while “sell-side” pricing refers to the price that distributors receive.  The spread between buy-side and sell-side pricing represents the profits of the distributors. There are some visibility to buy-side pricing through data providers, but sell-side pricing is highly guarded as it is vital to profitability and for competitive reasons.  CAH/ABC/MCK have all partnered with pharmacy chains and form procurement consortiums for generic drugs.
  On average, buy-side pricing deflates at mid-single-digit rate, and sell-side pricing would follow, and thus lead to stable profits. But the reality is more nuanced; buy-side deflation is sometimes faster, sell-side pricing sometimes react to other factors other than buy-side deflation.  For instance, unique circumstances (shutdown of plants, backlog of filings at FDA) led to unprecedented generic drug inflation in 2014 - 15; contract renewal led to sell-side price decline in 2017. 
  The point is all the headwinds/tailwinds related to generic drugs are temporary for distributors.  Over the long term, the profit dollars are pretty stable because each year there are drug patents expiring.
  Moat/Competitive Advantage
CAH operates in an oligopolistic industry
The industry is dominated by 3 companies - CAH, ABC and MCK.  Collectively they control near 95% of the market. They are all sophisticated operators with pricing discipline.
  CAH provides an essential link for manufacturers and providers that are irreplaceable
As outlined above in “Why can’t the distributors be cut off?”, CAH acts as a trusted counterparty and provides critical services including logistics, inventory management, compliance management, and supply-chain integrity.  It is deeply entrenched in the healthcare vertical.
  The existing relationships, low operating margins and massive capital investments are high barriers to entry
First, CAH has multiple relationships in a highly regulated industry.  New entrants, with no track records, have to convince existing operators to give them business.  Operations (i.e. electronic data interchange, link up order management systems, be in compliance with federal and state regulations, infrastructure buildout) are onerous and time consuming.
  Second, the rewards are not exactly rewarding.  Margins are thin; adjusted EBITDAR margins (definition provided below) for CAH, an oligopolistic operator with scale, ranged from 1.7% - 3.0% during FY 2007 - 17.  Furthermore, CAH/ABC/MCK each has assets in multiple tens of billions, and require $300 - 500mm of capex annually, which means new entrants have to commit at least $20B of capital to have a realistic chance.
  Bezos/Buffett/Dimon Healthcare JV
Combined together, the barrier to entry are too high even for Amazon.  It is widely reported in April that Amazon had tried and failed to break into the drug distribution business.  I am not worried about the new Bezos/Buffett/Dimon healthcare JV. They are going after bloated costs - margins are already razor-thin at CAH and there is nothing much to cut.
  Risks
Questionable capital allocation outside drug distribution business 
Its recent acquisitions in medical equipment production are dilutive both to earnings and business quality.  It is unclear if these businesses possess the same competitive advantage as the core distribution business.
  Headline risks from generic drug deflation
Although this does not impact long term earnings power, stock price will decline because this is what investors focus on.
  Valuation Math
* Adjusted EBITDAR and Operating Income
  * Long term organic gross margin growth
  Key Assumptions
I assume margins would mean-revert as the business is not structurally impaired.
  GM/Revenue is volatile due to revenue mix-shift and generic drug pricing dynamic.  I focus on EBITDAR/Gross Margin because GM is more stable than revenue.
  Given the moat of the business, I am highly confident that organic growth before reinvestment of retained earnings, would track inflation which I assumed to be 2.5%.  This is very conservative as CAH pays out less than 40% of its earnings. I assumed zero earnings growth from reinvestment of retained earnings.
  Assume 100 bps increase in interest rate paid on debt
I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise do not hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

2021-02-05,CT3 1HP,WEYS,WEYCO GROUP INC (WEYS),https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/WEYCO_GROUP_INC_WEYS/3624891953,190000000.0,19.41,"Description
Weyco's stock has been left behind in the reopening rally thus far, but low valuation multiples, recovering sales, and significant but unheralded cost reductions set up shareholders for a double over the next 1-2 years.
1. Elevator pitch
Despite the rollicking rally in small caps, Weyco has lately been stuck around half its all-time highs (mid-2018) and only very recently started to climb off its 2020 lows. At 8.9x 2019 adjusted EPS (before COVID-19 struck), 1.01x book value (1.26x tangible), 0.57x EV/2019 sales, and a 4.9% dividend yield—all buttressed by a fortress balance sheet—there's a lot of old-school value here.

Of course, metrics like these are often associated with businesses in secular decline or worse. Weyco had a poor run from 2007 to 2017, which may still weigh on investors' view of the stock. But management used those years to diversify its product lineup and sales channels, positioning the company for a stronger recovery from the current downturn compared with the last one.

We also believe Weyco is an undiscovered restructuring story. Its first quarterly losses in more than three decades threatened the controlling Florsheim family's ample dividends, prompting quick action—the scope of which we think we've uncovered with regression analysis. We believe earnings could return to peak levels even without a full sales recovery, particularly if perennially lossmaking foreign operations are cut loose.

While the trajectory is somewhat COVID-dependent, we think the destination is pretty easy to figure out. Weyco is positioning itself to surpass its pre-COVID peak in profits, probably as early as this year. Assuming the stock can respond to rapidly recovering sales and earnings by reaching the 2010-19 median P/E of 17.5x, the stock would reach $40. If we're wrong, we believe a low initial valuation, high tangible asset value, and the financial interests of the controlling family ought to limit our downside.
2. From 30,000 feet: Why should anyone care?
Nike this isn't. We’ll happily concede that as a business, Weyco is almost as boring as it gets. It’s small, representing less than 1% (at wholesale) of the $80 billion U.S. footwear market. It's uncovered, unloved, and not even hated (the 69,000 shares sold short at January 15 represented only 4.3 days’ worth of average daily volume).
Founded in 1906, the Milwaukee-based company designs, imports, markets, and distributes footwear, mostly in the United States. Its brands are Florsheim, Stacy Adams, Nunn Bush (these three being mostly men’s dress and casual shoes), BOGS (outdoor shoes and boots), and Rafters (sandals). Weyco says its products are sold in over 10,000 retail outlets as well as online; no one customer accounts for more than 10% of sales. Manufacturing is contracted out to Chinese factories (recently around 70% of volume), with India in the lead among other countries of origin. 
The North American Wholesale segment (80% of 2019 revenue, 103% of operating income) sells to third-party retailers as well as Weyco’s other two segments. The first of these is North American Retail (8% of 2019 revenue, 10% of operating income), which over time has deftly transformed itself from a traditional brick-and-mortar business into an e-commerce platform. The Other segment (12% and negative 13%) comprises operations outside North America, primarily a lossmaking brick-and-mortar retail footwear business in Australia. (Corporate costs are included in the North American Wholesale segment.)
According to the most recent 10-K filing, the Florsheim family controls 50% of the stock, but they did not found Weyco as such. Instead, a scion of the original Florsheim business (Thomas Sr., still chairman emeritus) jumped ship for the Weyenberg Shoe Manufacturing Company in 1964. With the business rechristened Weyco Group in 1990, this branch of the family managed to buy the original Florsheim operations out of bankruptcy in 2002. 
In absolute terms or when compared with the Russell 2000, Weyco’s stock performed respectably in the 1990s (10-year total-return CAGR of 12.9% vs. 12.0%, according to Bloomberg) and quite nicely in the 2000s (12.4% vs. 3.8%). However, the 2008-09 recession and drawn-out recovery thereafter were rough on Weyco. Too much of the business was in dress shoes as the world slid toward casual. Too much of the business flowed through department stores as department stores lost relevance and revenue. Operating income (ex-items) fell by nearly half from 2007 to 2009 and had not fully recovered even by 2019. The stock returned only 4.1% annualized in the 10 years through December 2019, falling well behind the Russell’s 11.8%. In particular, the stock began to slump from mid-2018 onward, with noteworthy underperformance in May 2019 amid higher tariffs and considerable uncertainty on Chinese imports.
3. On closer inspection … 
Let’s stipulate that if Weyco can recover from COVID—if earnings can reattain the 2019 peak of $2.17 a share (adding back $0.07 a share of store-closure costs in Australia)—then its stock is cheap. The following charts show the company's valuation at historically low levels if we omit the COVID-induced plunge in sales and earnings (the denominators of P/E and EV/sales are held constant at full-year 2019 levels).
     Using more cyclically-stable metrics such as book value and dividends, the stock also shows up in favorable territory relative to its own past. 
     Data through Feb. 4, 2021. Sources for graphs and data: Company reports, Bloomberg, author's analysis.
Don't even get us started about industry comps. We agree that Weyco may well deserve to trade at wide discounts to Nike or Deckers, and probably something of a discount to the group medians. After all, it is much smaller and somewhat less profitable than these points of reference. But we find it very hard to believe the discounts should be this wide. (Note: Here we use current market values against 2019 financial results as a pre-COVID base for historical multiples, and 2021 consensus for forward ones—except for Weyco, where we've used our own 2021 estimates in the absence of any published consensus. We describe the basis for our 2021 estimates below.)
To be fair, there's not much about Weyco's financial performance in 2020 that makes the stock attractive. Through the first nine months, sales dropped 39% (including 72% in Q2) and operating income ex-items swung from positive $15.9mm to negative $6.5mm. For the stock to work, the company has to bounce back from COVID—and stay back.
We think it will, and point to several promising signs.
* Amid intense competition for footwear in general, cultural headwinds for dress shoes in particular, and the dwindling ranks of mid-tier department stores, Weyco has survived with strong niche brands and by broadening its product portfolio. The early 2011 acquisition of BOGS/Rafters was a key event, adding boots and outdoor shoes to the company's mix for the first time. Since then, change has been more evolutionary than revolutionary, with the company introducing more dress/casual and outright casual products under its three dress brands. Though sales growth has been far from spectacular, a CAGR of 2.5% for the North American Wholesale segment from 2011 to 2019 implies that the company has at least held its own, most likely with a little volume growth given that industry inflation has run at only 0.8% a year in the same period. More important, this segment has shown relatively stable to gently improving gross and operating margins over time.
     * We are also impressed that the company navigated the effects of higher Chinese tariffs with almost no pain. For all the fanfare and fear, in only one quarter (Q1/2020) did Weyco's gross margin suffer as higher-cost inventory was sold through. Including this impact, and then the dramatic falloff in volume, we estimate the North American Wholesale segment's gross margin is down only 100bp YTD (34.1% vs. 35.1% in the first nine months of 2019).
* At the top line, Weyco's North American Retail segment barely grew from 2009 to 2019, but it's a bit more impressive in light of the fact that the company closed (net) 28 of 36 brick-and-mortar stores that operated at year-end 2009 and fully replaced those sales with the company's own e-commerce sites. Profitability improved considerably in the transition through 2019. This transformation continues in 2020, with 3 more stores closed through September, but year-over-year sales falling only 15% in Q3 and the segment nearly back to break-even before restructuring charges.
     * As for Weyco's ""Other"" segment, comprising operations mainly in Australia but also elsewhere in Asia and Europe, there's not much good to say except that this business has become a drag on results, masking in part the progress of the rest of the business. It's still mainly a brick-and-mortar business, and at least as long as Weyco has owned it, the Other segment has always had lower gross margins than the North American Retail business. In addition to the difficulties of traditional retail, management has cited the weak Australian dollar for the segment's problems, since it imports its goods in U.S. dollars. It hasn't been profitable on a full-year basis since 2017. In 2019, the Other segment lost $3.5mm (including $940,000 of store closure and impairment charges). Finally, thanks to COVID, the segment lost more than that ($3.8mm, with $2.8mm of charges) in Q3/2020 alone. As we see it, the opportunity here is simple: Just stop these losses, without which we estimate Weyco would have earned $2.37 a share in 2019 and which accounts for two-thirds of the company's year-to-date operating loss in 2020.
4. Management is (finally) taking firmer control of Weyco's destiny.
We think Weyco has demonstrated a sufficient amount of long-term staying power for us to be intrigued by the stock's low valuation. Though there's a bit of an interesting past here, we also find that management has been friendly to shareholders in recent years. The company has a long history of share repurchases and an even longer one (at least 30 years that we can vouch for) of escalating annual dividend payments. In this respect at least, we believe managers' interests are strongly aligned with shareholders: It appears that both CEO Thomas Florsheim Jr. and COO John Florsheim collected more cash for themselves through dividend payments in 2019 than they received in paychecks.
It follows that anything that might threaten those dividend payments would get management's attention—fast. 
""We're reexamining every aspect of our business. And, you know, for a while, I think, [the] company's had the luxury of funding some things maybe weren't that profitable because we're making a fair amount of money in other areas of our business. We are literally studying every single expense line in our company right now ...""
     — Weyco Group CEO Thomas Florsheim Jr., Q2/2020 conference call, August 5, 2020
Based on results in Q3, we believe Mr. Florsheim meant what he said. Weyco may not be able to control the volume of its sales in the midst of a pandemic, but it can control costs. Both Q2 and Q3 were extremely sloppy, with one-off items ranging from the write-off of receivables from the bankrupt J.C. Penney to government wage and rent subsidies. We presume that the sloppiness and the uncertainty will last as long as the pandemic does. What we really want to see is how much cost is actually being taken out of the business.
First, we used regression analysis to develop a model for selling & administrative costs (excluding all named items in the K's and Q's) in the North American Wholesale segment. (This is one of the attractive aspects of seasonal businesses—simple statistical techniques can reveal a lot about a company's cost structure.) For the relatively placid stretch from 2012 to 2019, 32 quarters in all, a straight regression against sales had an R-squared of 0.6463. We found a tighter fit with gross profit dollars: an R-squared of 0.7853 as shown below. Intuiting that fixed costs were not necessarily ""fixed"" over eight years, we added an inflation component (core CPI) to develop a two-factor model for S&A; the R-squared of this multiple regression rose to 0.8225 and is shown below at right. The average variance from predicted to actual was $496,000 per quarter, or about 3.6% on average.
      Data through Feb. 4, 2021. Sources for graphs and data: Company reports, Bloomberg, author's analysis.
A model like this can do a good job predicting results in an ""ordinary"" business environment. 2020 was hardly ordinary, so we shouldn't be surprised to see the model lose some predictive power—or, given the model's assumption that fixed costs are indeed ""fixed"", the model might instead alert us to changes in the company's cost structure. Q1/2020 was close to in-line with our model. In Q2, with sales down about 80% both sequentially and year over year, costs didn't fall quite as fast as the model predicted (costs were 2 standard deviations above forecast). We attribute this to the speed of the shutdowns relative to management's ability to respond. But with sales bouncing back sharply in Q3, selling & administrative cost in the North American Wholesale segment (again, this excludes all one-off items cited by management) was slightly down from Q2--and $2.1mm lower than what our model would have predicted (fully 4 standard deviations below forecast).
Management is quite reluctant to give guidance, which makes sense, given the volatility of the retail environment in any quarter or year (let alone the impacts of COVID-19). However, combined with management's commentary about cost reductions on the Q2 and Q3 conference calls, we think it's likely that the North American Wholesale segment has shed roughly $8mm worth of annualized selling & administrative expense (from a 2019 base of $61mm). The depth of the cost cuts in Q3 may seem extreme (though we detect nothing unusual on the balance sheet in terms of accrual reversals, etc.). At the same time, we also suspect that not all of the savings were realized in Q3--the full run-rate impact might not show up until Q4, and so could be even larger.
This also addresses one of the challenges Weyco's past poses for investors. When sales fell in the 2007-09 recession, company-wide gross margin declined less than 100bp, but the operating margin plunged to 8.1% from 14.7% because management was slow to right-size the cost structure for a tougher environment. We detect a great deal more urgency on the part of management in this downturn. With the cost reductions recorded in Q3, the North American Wholesale segment returned to an operating profit before charges. Even with sales still down a whopping 35% year over year, the segment posted an adjusted operating margin of 10.8% versus 14.0% in Q3/2019.
In addition to the cost reductions in North American Wholesale, Weyco closed 3 more of its remaining (and lossmaking) brick-and-mortar stores in Q3, leaving just 5 of the old breed with the lights on. We suspect the cutting came late in the quarter as its selling & administrative expense was down only slightly sequentially and even less so year over year, so the bulk of the benefit lies ahead. Even so, the North American Retail business improved to a $184,000 adjusted operating loss in Q3 from $856,000 in Q2. The Other segment saw a substantial reduction in cost as well; while its $502,000 adjusted operating loss is discouraging, it was only half the loss of the year-ago, pre-COVID Q3/19, even with sales down 50%.
5. What we're expecting, and what we think it's worth (~$40 a share).
It's extremely difficult to contemplate what any one quarter might bring in this environment, but we're willing to stake a claim to the notions that (1) the virus will eventually go away and (2) life and business will resume some normal pattern that would be recognizable in the past. For modeling purposes, we articulate this idea by building a gradual recovery of sales in the North American Wholesale and North American Retail segment such that by Q4/21, these segments are back to 95% of their pre-pandemic annualized run rates (with 100% recovery by full-year 2022).
As for costs, we assume stable gross margins—we regard this as fair given the updrift in gross margins before COVID and resilience under the gun, and note too that an environment of rapidly recovering sales seems like an odd time for price wars. We use our regression-based modeling of selling & administrative costs, plus our assumption that roughly $8mm of annualized cost has been taken out of the North American Wholesale segment as of Q4/2020 and an additional $1mm ($333,000 per just-closed store) out of North American Retail. We fade these savings as the recovery unfolds into 2021 and then 2022 as we assume some reinvestment to support future growth, but we still expect improvements in operating margins.
Our boldest projection may be this: We think time is nearly up on the Other segment's losses. While as recently as the Q3 conference call management believed it still had a good market opportunity in Australia--even in brick & mortar retail--—we also note their accountants' decision to impair the segment's deferred tax assets (no doubt arising from past operating losses). We agree that there may still be some opportunity with wholesale or online sales for Weyco's brands in Australia, but we simply don't see the kinds of losses this segment generates being tolerated much longer. We think it's reasonable to simply exclude it from earnings post-2020, which we model through another 50% decline in sales in 2021 (and zero sales in 2022) but with enough cost reductions to leave operating profit around break-even. How things unfold, exactly, remains to be seen. Whatever happens, we assume there will be more restructuring charges, but the segment might be thrown into discontinued operations or otherwise excluded from ongoing results.
At the bottom line, we get a company that is smaller on the top line in 2021 than 2019, but thanks to cost-cutting is earning more ($2.27 a share ex items) compared with the last pre-COVID year. In 2022, a full recovery to pre-COVID sales volume for the North American segments gets our forecast to $2.64 a share. Can this pass the smell test? From 2019 to 2022, our forecast contemplates a $5.5mm improvement in operating profit; $2.5mm of that is simply the removal of the Other segment's operating losses. With identical sales for the remaining segments in 2022 compared with 2019, the $3mm improvement simply reflects cost reduction—about $2mm in North American Wholesale, or around 3% of pre-COVID overhead, and $1mm in North American Retail, which may only be running half as many brick-and-mortar locations on average as it did during 2019.
As our forecast implies that Weyco is a higher-margin, higher-ROIC business within a year or two than it had been on average over the past decade, we think the 17.5x median P/E of 2010-19 is a realistic target (especially considering how high multiples are across the U.S. equity market). On our $2.27 EPS forecast for 2021, the stock would reach $40 in a year, plus $0.96 a share (or perhaps slightly more) in cash dividends. Two years out, on earnings of $2.64 a share, 17.5x yields a $46 target plus $2 of dividends.
We think $40 in a year, at least if our estimates are directionally correct, would foot reasonably well to the stock's history and peers. Admittedly $40 implies valuation multiples other than P/E that are at the upper end of Weyco's history, but we believe this would be justified given today's lower tax rates and higher multiples across the U.S. market.
6. What if we're wrong?
For Weyco to recover its 2019 level of North American revenue within three years, the post-pandemic world will have to return more or less to normal. Dress and dress/casual shoes are worn mainly in the workplace (meaning the wearer is onsite rather than online) or at social events (weddings, graduations, etc.). If the world has permanently shifted into a more atomized, socially distanced mode, it may be tough for Weyco to shift its product portfolio fast enough to stay relevant. But if sales do not recover as fast as we expect, we believe management can and will keep a tighter rein on costs for longer than we've modeled. If it takes until 2022 for the company to reach our 2021 levels of sales and profitability (an 88% recovery to pre-COVID run rates rather than 100%), we still think the stock would be $40, just in two years rather than one.
Our take on gross margins and overhead cost reductions could prove optimistic as well, despite the favorable data we've observed through the worst (we hope!) of the pandemic. Even so, we think the stock's downside from this level is limited.
* Although insider control necessarily limits the influence of outside investors, we believe the Florsheim family will prove willing to do whatever it can in order to maintain the current dividend. In a stable state, that means earning at least $1.20 a share to generate $1.00 a share in free cash flow (at the 2012-19 cumulative free cash flow conversion rate of 83%). If even a fully recovered Weyco earns only $1.20 a share, the stock is trading at only 16x, roughly equal to its 20-year median multiple and less than its 10-year.
* Speaking of cash generation, Weyco delivered $3.7mm in positive free cash flow in the first three quarters of 2020 despite (1) an $8.9mm GAAP loss and (2) elevated capital spending due to an expansion of its headquarters facility. From $7.4mm in 2019 and $3-$4mm guided for 2020, management expects capital expenditures of only $1-$2mm in 2021—half of depreciation.
* Certainly by the standards of this financially decadent age, Weyco's balance sheet is a fortress. At Sept. 30, the balance sheet held $6.9mm in cash and $13.7mm in marketable securities (both short- and long-term) against $5.2mm in short-term debt. Net cash was $1.76 a share. Weyco did have a pension deficit of $27mm, but in ""other assets"" it also has about $18mm worth of cash value in corporate-owned life insurance policies.
* Tangible book value at Sept. 30 was $14.63 a share, including $11 worth of receivables and inventory net of payables. And (despite what the accountants might force due to Weyco's low stock price at Dec. 31) we wouldn't dismiss the $4.60 a share worth of goodwill, trademarks, and other intangibles (total book of $19.59). In recent years Weyco has collected an average of $3mm a year in 100%-margin licensing revenue from partners selling non-shoe accessories (belts and the like) using its brand names. Even in some kind of liquidation scenario, we believe Weyco's brands would have ongoing cash value.
Finally, while our expectation that Weyco will cut off its foreign losses within a year or two may be the shakiest part of our forecast, Herb Stein is usually right in the end: When something is unsustainable (like shipping millions of dollars that could otherwise be paid out as dividends halfway around the world to subsidize never-ending losses), it tends to stop. Perhaps management will find a way to keep a presence Down Under with wholesale sales through other retailers while leveraging its e-commerce success in the U.S. But one way or another, it seems as unrealistic for management to continue tolerating multi-million-dollar losses abroad as it would for outside shareholders.

2019-09-13,mike126,KLAC,KLA CORP,https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/KLA_CORP/9809504604,23826000000.0,149.61,"Description
  KLA is one of my current top long ideas. It is an excellent business at a reasonable price. For more background on the industry and the value chain, I recommend the reader to also look at the VIC write-ups on Applied Materials (AMAT), Lam Research (LRCX), TSMC and Micron (MU). 
  Thesis overview 
KLA (formerly known as KLA-Tencor) is one of the leading semiconductor capital equipment (semicap) providers globally.    KLA has a $24B market cap, roughly half the current size of the industry leader, Applied Materials (AMAT). KLA is specialized and dominant in “process control” and specifically, metrology and inspection, i.e. measuring and checking semiconductors for defects.  The diagrams below illustrate the various steps in the semi manufacturing process. The segment that KLA focuses on (“process control”) is on the right-hand side. 
      I confess that I cannot grasp the exact science of what this company and its peers do, but the consistently good financial results mean it is reasonable for me to claim (with some confidence) that KLA is one of the higher-quality companies in the semicap and semi-related sectors.  KLA’s average GAAP EBIT margins over the past 5 years are 32%, a level that AMAT and ASML (a complete monopolist in its own segment - lithography) have not matched even in their peak years. KLA’s margins, revenues and cash flows are steadier than those generated by its peers, a function of KLA’s underlying segment (metrology and inspection) being less volatile and less linked to explicit capacity expansion decisions of the industry clients.   Roughly 60% of KLA’s shipments relate to leading edge, and 40% to trailing edge. KLA’s business also has a balanced exposure between memory vs logic & foundry.   
  KLA’s equipment is some of the most complex in the fab and the customers undergo extensive training to learn to operate it.  Even very old KLA machines remain operational and attract a stream of service / maintenance fees a decade after installation.  KLA thus enjoys significant lock-in, with existing customers almost never switching from KLA and perpetuating KLA’s market share, which has been high and stable for many years.  20%+ of KLA’s revenue is services-related, and this segment is higher-quality than the analogous “services” segments of peers like AMAT and LRCX because KLA excludes parts. KLA also spends 15% of its revenue on R&D to maintain its position, and this is a higher percentage than AMAT (11%) or LRCX (11%). 
  KLA is a very shareholder-oriented company.  Management explicitly targets to return at least 70% of FCF to shareholders via dividends and repurchases.  Over the past 7 year, dividends + share buybacks totalled 118% of the company’s cumulative FCF. KLA has consistently increased its dividend, with a 16% dividend CAGR over the long term. 
  In the past 15 years, KLA never had a full year with negative FCF.  The company is so cash-generative that even while returning capital to shareholders and shrinking its share count, KLA still managed to fund M&A, buying numerous targets over the past 10 years to maintain KLA’s leadership.  KLA recently spent an amount equivalent to 15% of KLA’s market cap to acquire Orbotech. Orbotech is a lower-margin but faster growing business; the faster growth of the target and cost synergies result in the deal being immediately EPS-accretive.   The Orbotech deal also increases KLA’s addressable market (see below, along with pro-forma combined financials). 
    KLA is in a growth industry.  In 2015 KLA described itself as a 5-7% organic grower, with components of that 5-7% growth broken down as 3% from growth of WFE, 1-2% from share gains, and 1-2% from services growth.  KLA massively outperformed that expectation (with a 3-year organic revenue CAGR of 15% since the beginning of 2016), and recently updated its “growth algorithm” to 7-9% organic growth over the long-term. 
    This is clearly a very good business with a very shareholder-oriented management team and a bright medium term / long-term outlook, which leads to the question – what is the catch / what are the risks?
  Cycle risk
The semicap market is cyclical, as it is driven by the annual capex spend of TSMC, Intel, Micron, Samsung, SK Hynix etc.  Wafer fab equipment (WFE) spend is the common way to measure the size of the market. WFE in CY2018 (calendar year 2018) was around $50-54B (depending on the source), and the market expectation for CY2019 is $42-43B.  See chart below.
    Even though WFE is cyclical, in the long-term it is growing because the underlying market (semis) is growing.  Semis are a global, $450B revenue industry growing 6% mid-cycle (memory is growing faster; logic and foundry is growing slower, but the blended CAGR is 6%); the semis industry spends about 20-25% of revenue on capex (i.e. total capex around $100B). Half of that (i.e. $50B) is on WFE.  Capital intensity is stable or slightly going up for some segments like lithography. The $50B of WFE in CY2018 was split as $30B spent on memory and $20B spent on logic & foundry.  
    In CY2019, the current run-rate WFE is c.$42B and that is made up of c.$18B spent on memory and $24B spent on logic & foundry.  The $18B of current memory WFE is very low and means a reduction in global memory capacity, so it is unsustainable long-term and will likely go up in CY2021 or even CY2020.  The memory part of WFE is thus very far below the mid-cycle point. On the other hand, logic & foundry WFE is currently strong and is expected to be still strong in CY2020 based on the speculated capex plans of TSMC, so logic & foundry WFE is above the cycle mid-point.  It seems that the true “mid-cycle” WFE is slightly above the current level. If memory and logic & foundry were to both be “bad” simultaneously, the downside total WFE level appears to be around $35B but even that level cannot be held indefinitely and WFE would eventually strongly recover.  In other words – WFE is cyclical but it is a bottleneck on global technological progress and joined at the hip with a secularly growing industry (semis). The semi industry always eventually finds a way to improve, redesign, and shrink the chips (or stack them on top of each other). E.g. see below the historical and forward node roadmaps. Note also that the health of the customers generally improved significantly over the past decade due to consolidation (eg see the industry margins and ROE in DRAM after Micron took out Elpida) as well as greater diversification of end markets (i.e. market growth used to be dominated by PCs, then it was smartphones, and now it is servers and a range of other segments such as auto / IoT, etc). This is helping make the entire value chain more attractive and investable, in my view. 
    Defensive company during recovery
During the past semi cycles, KLA suffered less during semi industry downturns but also benefited less during upswings.  This cycle is no different, with KLA’s results and forward estimates less impacted than for those of the more cyclical semicap peers like AMAT and LRCX.  Similarly, KLA’s share price a lot less beaten-up over the past 2 years than AMAT or LRCX. E.g. see the charts below. 
    We are probably approaching an upswing, especially in memory, so the broadly-accepted idea is that it is currently best to own either more memory-oriented names or names in the semicap value chain that are more cyclical. Process control / metrology & inspection spend is less variable compared to spend elsewhere in the semicap value chain e.g. etching (Lam Research / LRCX) or deposition (Applied Materials / AMAT).  As a result, semi analysts and investors have a habit of trying to get long KLA into the downturn and then flip and get long LRCX or AMAT when it looks like the cycle has bottomed and is approaching an upswing. See below.
    Competition in e-beam
KLAs total non-services revenue in CY2018 was $3.2B, which is 50% share of the global semi process control market (sized at $6.5B per KLA and Gartner).  Even though KLA’s overall market share has been relatively stable around 50% for many years, according to Goldman Sachs and Gartner, KLA lost share in a specific part of that market – patterned wafer inspection, which makes up about 1/3rds of KLA’s non-services revenue.  In patterned wafer inspection, KLA’s technology – optical inspection – has recently been losing share to e-beam inspection, an alternative technology advanced by ASML.  
    KLA previously made the strategic decision to completely exit e-beam a few years ago on the belief that e-beam is an inferior technology with throughput that is dozens of times lower than optical inspection.  KLA’s overall view is that e-beam will remain a complementary technology to optical inspection, and they do not think there is a credible risk of substitution. See also their response to this on a conference call. 
    Nevertheless, as a competitive response to ASML and a technological “hedge”, KLA is now developing an e-beam inspection tool, too.  This could stem KLA’s share loss in patterned wafer inspection, targeted with a launch in CY2020.   
 

Limits to market concentration
A few years ago, KLA wanted to merge with LRCX while AMAT wanted to merge with Tokyo Electron.  However, the semicap markets were already very concentrated and the antitrust hurdles could not be cleared.  As a result, very large-scale M&A will probably remain off the table, possibly forever. 


Valuation and return profile
Broadly speaking, KLA currently trades at or above its long-term multiples of EPS or EBITDA.  
  Even so, I am prepared to argue that KLA’s quality, growth profile and shareholder-friendliness are such that KLA deserves premium multiples that are at least as high as the multiples commanded by best-in-class industrial companies.
  My forecasted base case, bull case and bear case financials are presented below, along with consensus Bloomberg estimates.  My base case expectation is for c. 7% KLA revenue CAGR after the next 12 months, with exit EBIT margins close to KLA’s 5-year historical average. My base case might be too conservative, but ""success = results - expectations"", as they say. In the bull case, my numbers are essentially almost the same as the sell-side consensus; in the bull case, I have 10% revenue CAGR after the next 12 months, and exit EBIT margins that are at peak level and 500bps above the base case.   The bear case is very negative and assumes that at exit, KLA’s absolute $ EBIT is lower than in FY2018. 
    Conclusion: By consistently generating high GAAP margins, respectable revenue growth and high ROCE, KLA has proven that it is a very good business.  The business spits out so much cash that when management sees value-creative inorganic uses for that cash, they go for that and when they do not, they return that cash via dividends and buybacks.  KLA was a lot cheaper even 6 months ago so the trailing 12M P/E multiple might not look like deep value, but for this kind of quality, I see it as reasonable-to-cheap on a long-term basis. I expect KLA to deliver a satisfactory multiple of invested capital and IRR over the long term.

  Ulta Beauty, Inc. is a best-in-class, industry-leading business available in the market today at a discount to quantifiable intrinsic value. Current prices provide long-term investors with the opportunity to own an excellent business for a reasonable price as it goes through a period of temporary turbulence.
  Company Overview: Ulta Beauty, Inc. is a specialty retailer of cosmetics, fragrance, haircare, and skincare products founded in 1990. The prototypical store is ~10k square feet and features a full-service beauty salon onsite, allowing Ulta to offer beauty services to its customers in addition to products. The company was founded in 1990 and is headquartered near Chicago, IL. Ulta has 1,213 stores in 50 states as of August 3, 2019 and is on pace to add 80 in FY 2019. The business is seasonal with a Q4 sales peak for the winter holidays. 95% of customers participate in the company's loyalty program, which provides the company with customer-level data it analyzes to drive up engagement and average ticket size. The company's strategy has been highly successful to-date, and the company now represents ~24.5% of the U.S. Prestige Beauty market (up 210bps from prior year) and ~7% of the $87Bn U.S. Total Beauty Products market while generating exceptional returns for shareholders over the past decade.
  Situation Overview: Up until last week, Ulta has been riding a multi-year expansion of the beauty market as U.S. consumers have devoted more and more dollars per capita to skincare, haircare, and cosmetics. Cosmetics account for roughly half of Ulta's business on a revenue basis today and carry the highest gross margin, meaning the category drives the majority of Ulta's profitability. During its Q2 2019 earnings call after the close on Thursday, ULTA pulled back its 2019 EPS guidance by 8% and warned analysts of a sharp pull-back in cosmetics in the first few weeks of Q3. The revised EPS guidance for 2019 represents ~9-10% YoY growth but more importantly implies low-single-digit EPS growth in the second half of the year. The stock received more than 5 analyst downgrades in response and shares dropped more than 30% the next day, the largest single-day decline in their history. Ulta last changed hands at $235.70 in after-hours trading on Friday, representing just under 20x the revised EPS guidance of $11.86-12.06. However, the company still has no debt, an industry-leading market position, ROIC over 30%, attractive long-term growth prospects, and an aggressive stock repurchase program. Therein lies the opportunity.
  Ulta's long-term competitive position would benefit from a recession: Beauty is a discretionary and cyclical category and Ulta will experience SSS, EPS, and likely share price declines in a recession. I avoid macroeconomic forecasting wherever possible, but given the yield curve has essentially inverted it's worth belaboring this point a bit. Although a recession would temporarily impair Ulta's earnings power, many of the company's competitors are structurally disadvantaged due to high debt levels and exposure to weaker non-beauty categories (e.g. major department stores) or otherwise poorly capitalized (e.g. mom and pop beauty retail shops and salons) and are likely to go bankrupt in an acute recession. With no debt and a fairly clean balance sheet, Ulta should gain significant share during the next recession even if consumers temporarily delay beauty purchasing by using up their existing inventory or forgoing purchasing. In the meantime, Ulta's significant share repurchase program should allow it to create significant value for shareholders if the stock price declines further -- the planned $700M share repurchase in 2019 represents ~5% of today's market cap at $235.70 with 59.3M fully diluted shares. The combination of stock repurchases and improved market position should drive significant improvement in Ulta's per share earnings power during a recovery despite a temporary blip in a recession.
  Long-term growth targets are achievable: Please see the below table breaking down my LT growth targets for cash flow to equity in low and base cases which I'll later use to feed valuation assumptions. Through the last cycle (2007-2018), Ulta grew operating income at a 30% CAGR and grew diluted EPS at a 33% CAGR, but current investors do not need to assume anything nearly as heroic to make the stock attractive as a long-term investment. In the paragraph below I will breakdown my low and base case assumptions for 7-year go-forward growth rates.
  7-Yr CFe Growth Decomposition Low Base
SSSG (excl. E-Commerce)   1.0% 4.0%
E-Commerce Growth   1.0% 2.0%
New Stores   3.1% 4.9%
Subtotal: Sales Growth  5.1% 10.9%
Gross Margin Expansion   0.0% 0.5%
SG&A Operating Leverage -1.0% 0.5%
Reduction in Growth Capex 1.0% 0.0%
Total Cf to Equity Growth 5.1% 11.9%
  My low case assumes a brick and mortar SSS growth rate of 1% (below the rate of inflation and significantly below the 4% brick and mortar SSG delivered in the Q2 2019 ""miss"") and my base case assumes 4% (in-line with the most recent quarter). My low case assumes e-commerce growth of 1% (half of the 2% SSG e-commerce contributed in Q2) while my base case assumes 2% (in-line with MRQ). I assume that new stores contribute ~3% annual growth in my low case (assumes management only reaches the low end of their saturation target of 1,500-1,700 stores in 7 years, which represents ~42 stores per year or roughly half of their 80 new stores in 2019) and ~5% in my base case (high end of saturation target in 7 years, or ~70 stores per year - still below current new store pace).
  In the base case, I assume gross margin can contribute 0.5% annual CF growth, which is conservative given ULTA's average gross margin expansion of 43bps annually from 2007-2018. Gross margin expanded 40bps in the MRQ, or $6.6M, equal to 2.2% of the quarter's FCF before adjusting for taxes. I also assume in the base case that management gets 0.5% annual CF growth from SG&A leverage, which is similarly conservative given ULTA's average SG&A leverage of 26bps annually from 2007-2018.
  In the low case, I assume that management is able to counteract the effects of SG&A deleverage and lower growth through growth capex and/or other expense reductions. To quote the CFO on this, ""there was a time before [the recent growth wave] where Ulta operated very effectively, and very well performed, produced some really great financial results on much lower comps. So we're no stranger to operating in a tougher, lower, growth kind of environment and that's just the kinds of things that we're pivoting towards right now."" So in short, the low case assumes 5% sales growth with flat margins, but I believe that 5% cash flow growth through the cycle would be exceedingly disappointing for this business.
  Valuation and Recommendation: At $235.70, the stock is available for just under 20x this year's revised EPS guidance range of $11.86-12.06. Under the base case laid out above, if you believe ULTA can grow 2019 share repurchases of $700M (proxy for cash flow to equity) at a 12% CAGR over the next 7 years, capitalizing in year 7 with a 2.5% perpetuity growth rate and an 8% CoE discount rate, this investment should yield a 15% 7-year IRR from today's levels. Said differently, Ulta trades at a ~30% discount to intrinsic value today assuming an 8% equity discount rate. In the low case of 5% 7-year cash flow growth, the investment still yields a 9% IRR and trades in-line with intrinsic value today.
  While I do believe the long-term risk/return is asymmetrically positive today, beauty retail is a procyclical category and there is a real possibility that shares will become cheaper over the next 12 months. Management didn't provide much backup for its guided same-store growth reacceleration in Q4, which spooked analysts on the latest earnings call. To the extent that Q4 misses or 2020 guidance disappoints, I think there is a very good chance the stock will gap down again. Accordingly, I'm recommending initiating a small 100-200bps position today with buy prices in the +/-200 range in the event of further price declines (<17x 2019E EPS of ~$12).
 I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

RGS is a very attractive under-the-radar turnaround with potential to double on the back of EBITDA increasing 67% over the next two years.  There is a relatively new management team with an A+ CEO who is in high gear executing on a credible turnaround plan. A key part of the plan includes significant EBITDA improvement from recent steps to sell and franchise, or close, almost all of its underperforming salons.  These improvements have not hit reported results yet and are unappreciated by the market.  On top of this, it is a recession resistant business with a net cash balance sheet which provides stability, downside protection, and optionality for buybacks.
  Business Overview
RGS is the largest hair salon chain in the US, operating 6,300 owned salons and 2,600 franchised salons under brand names such as Supercuts and SmartStyle.  The salon figures are as of the most recent fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, but they are changing due to recent transactions as I’ll describe.  RGS is primarily focused on the value segment with prices in the $18-$22 range for a haircut.  The revenue mix is 77% Services, 20% Product and 3% Royalties and Fees.  RGS receives a 4-6% royalty on revenue at franchised salons.
  The 6,300 owned salons fall into four somewhat distinct brands/groupings with different dynamics and financial profiles.  RGS does not neatly breakout profitability by brand, but there is enough info to piece it together as I’ll describe.  
  Supercuts
Approximately 1,000 Supercuts salons. This is RGS’s flagship brand and its best performing brand, with the highest margins in the company.  The margins are disclosed in the Supercuts’ Franchise Financial Disclosure document (FFD).  Conveniently, the FFDs break out margins for the top, middle and bottom third of Supercuts salons.  Even the bottom third are decently profitable. 
  SmartStyle 
Approximately 2,700 SmartStyle salons.  The SmartStyle brand salons are located exclusively in Wal-Marts.  This is a decently profitable brand which we can see in SmartStyle’s FFD.  However, the bottom third are big money losers, costing RGS approximately $13mm of EBITDA at the store level before taking into account the associated regional management overhead.  The table below shows the summary of the average revenue and EBITDA per salon for Supercuts and SmartStyle as disclosed in the FFDs.   Note: these are the only two brands which RGS franchises, so they are the only two with FFDs.
                                        Shopping Mall Salons & UK
Approximately 900 salons based in shopping malls under the Regis and Mastercuts brand names, and 250 UK salons.  This grouping is RGS’s worst performer due to the negative traffic trends for shopping malls which have harmed many retailers.  RGS recently sold and franchised these salons in late October 2017 and disclosed these salons were losing $4mm of EBITDA.  
  SignatureStyle
Approximately 1,500 SignatureStyle salons. This is a catch-all for a 50+ regional brands that RGS acquired when it was in a roll-up stage 10-20 years ago.  You can back into the margins for this segment by subtracting the other segments from the total company results.  The EBITDA margins are approximately 15%, so in between Supercuts and SmartStyle.  However, like SmartStyle, I think the bottom third are losing money.  I estimate the bottom third have negative EBITDA of $3mm.
  Franchised Salons
Approximately 2,600 franchised salons consisting of roughly 1,700 Supercuts, 800 SignatureStyle and 200 SmartStyle.
  Background
  Consistent Underperformer & Activist Target
RGS has been consistently underperforming for years, with negative comps in seven of the last eight years, averaging -2% annually.  The lead up to the present day requires some explanation.  RGS was created through a roll-up in the 1990’s-2000’s and was run by its founders until the activist Starboard pushed management out in 2011 through a proxy fight.  (Starboard invested at ~$15 per share in mid-2011, and the share price is relatively unchanged since them.)  Starboard successfully argued that RGS was underperforming and had bloated costs.  Shortly afterward, in 2012, Birch Run invested and joined the board.  Birch Run remains RGS’s largest current shareholder.
  Failed Turnaround Under Prior CEO
In 2012 Starboard brought in a new CEO, Dan Hanrahan, from Royal Caribbean, and a new CFO from Unilever.  Long story made short, Starboard exited in 2012-2013 between $13-19 per share without much success.  The CEO was never able to sufficiently improve the business.  The CEO finally left after five years in April 2017 when he was replaced by the current CEO (more on the new CEO later).   
  The old CEO’s turnaround efforts were mainly focused on incremental operational improvements including better store management, formalized training, and closer district management support.  He accurately identified the main problem, namely that the bottom one third of salons where unprofitable, bleeding comps, and dragging down the performance of the overall company.  Unfortunately, his initiatives to fix the bottom third of salons with better management and training were insufficient.  This was in part because it was too hard to outrun the secular traffic decline at shopping mall based salons.  This leads up to the present strategic transformation and the bull case today.  
  Thesis
  1. New CEO is a Rock Star
Simply put, the more you get to know the new CEO, the more you will be impressed with him.  He’s been the CEO of nine companies as a turnaround manager, so he brings a lot of turnaround experience.  People who have worked with him in the past think very highly of him.  I think it is a very strong signal that he advised RGS as a consultant at Huron Consulting for six months, so he got under the hood before accepting the job.  He says he only took the job because he knew he’d be successful, and he found the opportunity to be so attractive that he delayed his retirement in Florida to move to Minneapolis.  On his first earning call he said, “This will be my last role as CEO.  I have no intention of failing.  I would not have accepted this role if I did not believe it could be done well.”  We did several reference checks which were phenomenal.  The punchline is that he is a force of nature with a rare combination of competence, intelligence, ethics, and drive, and he excels at pushing for change and creating value.  I think his early actions at RGS are consistent with his reputation.  We learned that his services as a CEO are in high demand, so RGS is lucky to have snagged him. 
  The CEO is well incented with 1.0mm shares of stock appreciation rights with a strike of $11.15, and 90K restricted stock units that vest if the stock is above $12.27.  These awards are only exercisable after three years from his April 2017 start date, so the CEO is locked into the shares over a reasonable investment horizon.  At my target price, the awards are worth $20mm.
  2. Exit Virtually All Unprofitable Salons  
The new CEO is in high gear executing a more radical plan to sell or close most of the bottom third of salons.   This should reveal the profitable core business.  He’s wasted no time since joining in April 2017.  First, In October 2017 he announced the sale and re-franchising of 858 mall-based salons under the Regis and Mastercuts brands, as well as 250 Regis and Supercuts salons in the UK, to a private equity firm called Regent.  While terms are not disclosed, RGS received negligible compensation and will receive a franchise royalty that ramps over a couple of years.  These salons contributed negative $4mm of EBITDA in FY 2017.  I believe the franchise royalty will contribute $8mm of EBITDA when fully ramped in two years (3.5% royalty rate on ~$230m of revenue). Second, in January 2018 he announced the closure of 600 underperforming company-owned SmartStyle salons (i.e. salons in WMTs).  These salons were losing $17-$19mm of EBITDA.  
  3. Increase Franchise Mix
The new CEO is moving more aggressively to franchise stores. Obviously franchise royalty revenues are higher margin and garner a higher multiple, so this is a very positive shift.  Management has not given targets around how many salons will be franchised beyond saying it is “an important element of the strategic transformation.”  Shortly after the new CEO joined, he announced that RGS reached agreements to sell 200 SmartStyle salons to franchise owners, and he promoted the General Counsel to the new position of President of Franchise Operations to help accelerate the franchise effort.  Management has said they are open to opportunistically selling clusters of salons to private equity similar to the large transaction with Regent in October. 
  RGS receives a 4-6% royalty rate on revenue at franchise stores.  RGS does not breakout the margin on franchise royalties (instead it groups royalties in with product sales to franchisees). I assume a 60% EBITDA margin on royalties although other public franchise companies have 80% EBITDA margins.
  4. Operational Improvements
The new CEO is making common sense operational improvements which should yield success.  First, in October, RGS announced that it is repositioning the SmartStyle brand.  Previously it was a positioned as a slightly higher-end full service salon catering to women (think color, blow dries, etc).  Now it is being positioned as a value oriented brand for busy families (think getting your three kids quick haircuts during a Wal-Mart shopping trip after soccer on Saturday morning).  Our channel checks were unanimous that Smartstyle’s prior brand positioning was idiotic because women don’t think of going to Wal-Mart for a “salon experience.”   
  Second, RGS is stepping up its marketing efforts.  The new CEO almost immediately replaced the head of marketing when he joined, and RGS is making major pivots including: 1) RGS is starting to advertising the SmartStyle brand for the first time. Oddly, it is RGS’s biggest brand in terms of salon count, and they have never advertised it.  2) RGS is starting to do digital/mobile marketing for the first time.  It has partnered with Buxton & Co which does consumer analytics for 4,000 retailers. 3) In January it announced an exclusive multi-year sponsorship with Major League Baseball for promotions around games and including broadcast, digital, mobile and social.  
  Third, RGS has a sophisticate labor scheduling system which matches stylist hours to demand levels.  Under the old CEO, RGS used the data to offer guidance to store managers, but ultimately store managers had discretion over labor scheduling.  This led in some cases to long waits at peak hours, like Saturday mornings, and overstaffing at slow times like Tuesday mornings.  New management has now taken discretion away from store managers and corporate is dictating staffing hours to the salons.  Management has said they are already seeing a significant benefit from this change.  
  Fourth, RGS is cutting corporate G&A, with new management saying that RGS is relatively inefficient.  For example, last quarter RGS announced it is reducing headcount by 65 at headquarters.  However, I don’t expect an absolute cut in SG&A because I think the efficiency savings will be used to fund increased marketing.
  5. Major Investor on the Board
Birch Run owns 23% of RGS and has been on the board for six years.  Given the long term struggles at RGS, Birch Run obviously has a strong incentive to turn the business around.
  6. Stable Recession Resistant Business
Everyone has to get their hair cut on a semi regular basis.  It is a simple and essential service business, and demand is fairly stable.  There is no threat of technology disintermediation, offshoring, or getting the merchandising wrong (to use a retail analogy). Demand show grow with the population and pricing should grow with inflation.
  7. Conservative Capital Structure
RGS has a net cash balance sheet with cash of $3.50 per share, and net cash of $0.90 per share.  Cash is 23% of market cap.   Gross debt is only 1.4x EBITDA.  Management has offered minimal guidance on the capital structure going forward beyond saying they will eventually look at buybacks, and that the gross leverage level is on the light side.
  8. Underfollowed Company
RGS is only followed by one sell side analyst.  RGS has not given financial targets, and so far management is leaving it to investors to connect the dots regarding the financial impact of the strategic transformation taking place.  I think this helps create the opportunity today.  As an aside, management is not promotional, keeps their heads down, and does not offer any guidance.  In my view, the lone sell side analyst is totally overlooking the EBITDA improvements from the recently announced salon closures/sales, not to mention the other operational improvements.
  9. Good Fit for Private Equity
RGS would seem to be a good fit for a private equity acquirer because its enterprise value is not too large, the business can sustain high leverage, and there is ample opportunity to create value from operational improvements.
  The Numbers
Below is a summary of my bridge from $87mm of EBITDA in FY2017 to $145mm in FY2020.  I’d note that RGS already announced the sale/closure of unprofitable salons which were causing a $22mm EBITDA drag, so this implies current pro forma EBITDA of $109mm, and that’s before any other operational improvements. The lone sell side analysts forecasts FY 2019 EBITDA of only $90mm.  
 
The detail behind this bridge comes from my effort to dis-aggregate the business into the top, middle and bottom performing salon groupings using data extrapolated from the FFDs mentioned above, and from RGS’s other disclosures.  The basic assumptions are: 1) RGS eliminates all of its unprofitable salons either by closing/selling or fixing.  This is not a stretch because RGS has already resolved ~80% of its money losing salons with the announced sale and closures.  2) The middle performing salons experience a modest 200 bps EBITDA margin improvement from 9% to 11% as a result of the common sense operating improvements.  These salons are still far less profitable that the top performing salons which have 20% EBITDA margins.  3) The topline grows at a low single digit rate (LSD).  I assume the top performers comp at an inflation like 2.5% while the middle performers comp at 3.5% because there is more room for improvement as a result of initiatives like increased marketing.  4) Franchise royalties grow as a result of the sale and franchising of the 1,100 salons to Regent (I assume a 3.5% royalty rate vs the typical 4-5% for other franchisees, although it is not disclosed) as well as business as usual new franchise openings.  Note: I am not assuming any additional large sales of owned salons to franchisees, although there is optionality for that to occur.  
Stepping back as a sanity check, I assume RGS gets to an 11% EBITDA margin which I think is very reasonable because most half-way decent retailers have EBITDA margins in the double digits. Furthermore, while management has not given guidance, I think they feel very comfortable with a double digit EBITDA margin.    
  Here is the summary output of my assumptions so you can get a sense for the moving parts:
  Valuation
On my forecasts, RGS trades at less than 5x FY 2020 EBITDA and 8x EPS ex cash. Because RGS has a large cash balance, I think it makes sense to look at the P/E excluding the cash.  For a price target, I assume 9x EBITDA and 16x earnings. I think these are reasonable multiples for a stable, profitable, branded hair salon chain which is partially franchised.  I also assume that RGS adds incremental debt while maintaining a conservative 1.5x debt/EBITDA ratio.  This results in an additional $100mm of cash by the end of FY 2020.  So, RGS ends FY2020 with almost $6 per share of cash.  In reality, I assume most of this cash will be allocated to buybacks.
 
Issues
The Turnaround has Already been Tried Before
In other words, why will the new CEO’s operational improvements work when Starboard’s handpicked CEO could not get it done?  First, it was the prior CEO’s first time being a CEO, and in hindsight his experience as an executive at Royal Caribbean was not especially relevant.  Second, the new CEO is clearly taking a much more aggressive approach to fixing the business as seen by the multiple changes he’s made in his first year, notably the sale and closure of unprofitable salons.  Third, the operational improvements sound like common sense: digital marketing, repositioning SmartStyle (i.e. Wal-Mart) to be more low-end, cutting corporate G&A, better optimizing labor hours, etc.  The prior CEO did not do any of these things.
  Competition
It is a competitive business and RGS has faced incremental competition from the rise of other chains such as Sport Clips and Great Clips which have “fresher” concepts and make better use of technology (e.g. allowing customers to track wait times on their smart phones).  There is competition to attract and retain stylists.  It is also price competitive. Customers will move in order to save $1 on a haircut.  I think the rise of competition has contributed to the slow bleed at RGS in the last five years, but the new CEO is taking steps to help RGS regain its competitive mojo, for example the partnership with MLB.  
  CEO is Not Permanent
Reading between the lines, I think the CEO will be at RGS for 2-3 years in total, so another 1-2 years from this point.  He’s 63 and has delayed his retirement for this job. He’s said his plan is to eventually recruit an outside CEO and manage the transition.  I think the CEO will only leave after declaring a decisive victory.
  IT System Upgrade
Management has talked about needing to upgrade its IT systems.  Sounds like it is a long term project that is still in the contemplation phase and might not ramp until 2020.  RGS has aged systems, and the new upgrade is expected to result in significant cost saves, but there will eventually be incremental capex and potential for distraction.
  Minimum Wage Increases
Stylist wages are obviously a big cost for RGS.  So far RGS has been able to pass on minimum wage increases through higher pricing, and it is confident that it can continue to do so.  Positively, RGS expects higher minimum wages to result in less stylist turnover.

              Cumberland Pharmaceutical- CPIX- is a specialty drug company with three FDA
approved drugs, $71 million in cash, 20 million shares outstanding with modest long term
debt. Insiders own  32%  of the stock, with institutions holding another 32%   of the shares. It's strategy is to stay away from the expensive drug R&D cycle in the hope of having a product to sell but rather find late-stage development product where they can complete an FDA approval and product launch. This strategy has kept the company profitable for past six years.
                  The company markets and sells its products thru a hospital and gastroenterology
sales force with  over 100 sales representatives and managers and work to partner the products to reach international markets. The product portfolio includes Acetadote Injection for the treatment of acetaminophen poisoning, Caldolor Injection, the first injectible treatment for pain and fever available in the United States, and Kristalose for Oral Solution, a prescription laxative.
                   Caldolor represents CPIX's most significant product opportunity based on its large potential for pain and fever in the intravenous market. It should be noted that Caldolor, intravenous ibuprofen, is the first injectible product approved in the United States for the treatment of both pain and fever. The product is used for controlling mild to moderate pain and the management of moderate to severe pain as an adjunct to opioid analgesics (think morphine) and for the reduction of fever. The market for injectible analgesics exceeded $329 million in 2009- 671 million units sold. The market for injectible opioids such as morphine, fentanyl accounted for 622 million units sold in 2009. Widely used for acute pain management, many side effects are present- nausea,  vomiting, sedation, headache, constipation, reduced GI motility and respiratory depression. Side effects from opioids can cause a need for further medication or treatment, and can cause longer hospital stays.
                                   In addition,  Caldolor is the only US -approved injectible treatment for fever.
Temperatures greater than 102 can cause confusion, hallucinations, convulsions, and
death. Patients with reduced gastric motility, nausea, recent surgery or endotracheal
intubation  are frequently unable to ingest, digest or tolerate oral products to reduce fever.
Alternative treatments would include ice packs, cooling blankets, and rectal delivery of
medications among others. Clinical studies have shown Caldolor to be safe and effective in providing IV fever reduction within 30 minutes.
                      Acetadote is an intravenous formulation of N-acetylcysteine, or NAC, for
the treatment of acetaminophen poisoning. It has become a standard of care for treating liver damage associated with Acetaminophen overdose. Acetaminophen overdose is a major problem in the US as it is a distinctly overused pain reliever. While NAC in oral form can be used  to treat poisoning victims, the IV product is the only alternative to many of the victims suffering nausea and vomiting.
                      In March 2010, CPIX  submitted to the FDA a supplemental NDA for the use of patients with non-acetaminophen induced liver damage based on clinical data at the University of Texas indicating a significantly improved chance of survival without a liver transplant. In August, the company announced that the FDA has extended its review of the supplemental NDA for three months.
                          The company has collaboration agreements with Vanderbilt University to develop a palliative treatment for fluid buildup in the lungs of cancer patients and the University of Tennessee to develop a novel asthma therapeutic to reduce asthmatic reaction in pediatric patients.
                            Sales for 2010 appears to be in excess of $40 million with a consensus eps estimate of $0.05. Currently about 100 sales representatives are marketing to hospitals, medical institutions and doctors. About 20 million shares are outstanding, $71 million in cash and only $6 million in long term debt. Three insiders in May were buyers of stock in the current price area. Board in early 2010 approved a $10 million buyback of which the company bought $1.4 million dollars of stock at $6.86 in the second quarter. Five Wall Street analysts provide coverage with a consensus 2011 estimate of $0.60. Over past 12 months, stock has traded between $16.19 and $4.70.

Maxxam represents an unusually favorable risk/reward opportunity to the contrarian value investor. Maxxam is a Houston based holding company whose business units include harvesting its 200,000 acres of northern California timberlands, owning and developing real estate, and aluminum manufacturing. Maxxam and its CEO, Charles Hurwitz, seem to cause a rolling of the eyes among people everywhere, just at the mere mention of their name!

The shares have declined from the $60 range three years ago and have recently fallen from $17 to $11.80 due to the bankruptcy of one of Maxxam’s subsidiaries, Kaiser Aluminum Corporation. Notwithstanding the erosion of intrinsic value due to Kaiser’s problems, Maxxam remains an asset rich company worth well more than it’s current trading price.

The common response to a proposed purchase of MXM shares is: “of course it’s cheap but it always has been and always will be…”. This perception, combined with the “Hurwitz factor” and the low level of liquidity in the shares has created a security, which has a large margin of safety and potential catalyst. The summary and conclusion first, with reasons for large discount to follow.

Maxxam’s intrinsic value is approximately $50 per share while its trading price is just under $10 per share. The intrinsic value is comprised as follows:

Estimated
Note Per share
Cash (net of debt) $5.50
Real Estate (approx. book value) (1) $22.00
Forest Products (est. fair market value) (2) $21.00
Kaiser Aluminum Corp. (KLU – NYSE) (3) $1.80
Total $50.30


(1) Maxxam invests in and develops commercial real estate primarily in Puerto Rico, Arizona, and California. The company owns 1,293 acres and resort facilities at Palmas Del Mar in Puerto Rico; 1,763 acres and 94 developed lots in Fountain Hills, Arizona (Scottsdale area); and 57 acres and 69 developed lots in Rancho Mirage, California (Palm Springs area). Additionally, the company owns 1,253 acres and 85 developed lots in other locations in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas; and has two joint venture investments as well. The book value of the real estate properties at 12/31/00 was $157 million, or $22 per share. The company believes the current fair market value of the property equals or exceeds the book value.

(2) The Forest Products operations are conducted primarily through a wholly owned subsidiary, Pacific Lumber Company. Pacific Lumber, which has been in continuous operation for over 130 years grows and harvests redwood and Douglas-fir timber and mills logs into lumber and other finished products. Pacific Lumber owns and manages over 200,000 acres of contiguous timberlands in Humboldt County along the northern California coast. The timberlands are 67% redwood, 26% Douglas-fir and 7% other.


The following chart summarizes the forest products operations:
Proj. Est.
(millions) 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 1996
Board Ft.
Harvested 190 175 150 100 160 250 250
Revenues 210 185 200 188 234 287 264
EBITDA 65 12 27 13 63 111 100

It should be noted that in March 1999, the company executed a landmark 50 year agreement with the federal and California governments whereby the parties agreed to certain permitted harvest levels and habitat conservation procedures. This agreement, which took years to negotiate, disrupted the company’s harvest levels significantly. Because of difficulties in implementation of the agreements between the various agencies, it has taken three years for Pacific Lumber’s harvest levels to achieve those contemplated in the agreements. Recently, the company indicated that its run rate harvest is approaching its target of 200 million board feet per year. During the past few years, the company has had to purchase timber, rather than harvest timber, in order to meet its sales requirements. Such purchases are costly and erode margins quickly. For 2002, due to increased harvests, lower costs, and firmer lumber pricing, the company expects to achieve significantly higher cash flow than 2001.

When valuing the forest products operations, one should look at both cash flow as well as price per acre. Valuing the 215,000 acres the company owns at the industry average $5,000 per acre (for this type of timberland) yields a gross value of $1.1 billion. This compares to a recent appraised value of $1.2 billion. With net debt of $650 million, a $1.1 billion valuation would equate to an equity value of $450 million or $63 per share.

Looked at from a cash flow perspective, and giving the company credit for what it believes is a normalized cash flow number of $80 million, an 10 multiple would provide a gross value of $800 million, or equity of $150 million, or $21 per share. Keep in mind that Pacific Lumber’s timberlands are very high quality species, and that such timberlands are a naturally growing asset.

I have assumed the more conservative valuation of $21 per share.

(3) Kaiser Aluminum (KLU – NYSE) shares have been valued at their current market price of $0.26. Maxxam owns 50 million shares which equates to a per share value for Maxxam of $1.80.
How is it possible for such a company with $50 per share of net assets to trade at $11.80?

A full history of the answer would be too lengthy for this letter, but the main reasons are as follows, with mitigating commentary:

1. Charles Hurwitz is seen by many as a corporate raider who cares only about his own interests and not those of his fellow shareholders.

I believe there is some element of truth to this, however, Hurwitz owns over 36% of the company (note that Hurwitz controls the company with approximately 70% of the voting shares through his 100% ownership of the preferred stock) and has seen the stock market value of his holdings go from $160 million to $28 million today. During this time, Hurwitz has not enriched himself with salary, options, etc. In fact, the company has continuously repurchased stock in the open market, with such purchases exceeding two million shares over the past five years. The company has also recently been purchasing its own debt (holding company debt) in the low 80’s. Hurwitz has much of his net worth tied up in his MXM shares.

2. The company is heavily leveraged and one of its main assets, Kaiser Aluminum just filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11.

Kaiser’s debt is non-recourse to Maxxam, as is the debt of Pacific Lumber Co. All of Maxxam’s recourse debt at the holding company level has been subtracted from the cash in the above chart. Kaiser Aluminum’s bankruptcy has decreased the intrinsic value of MXM from $85 to $60.

3. Maxxam is somehow exposed to the asbestos claims made against Kaiser Aluminum.

This is false and the notion is inconsistent with United States corporate law. Kaiser is a public company owned 63% by Maxxam and 37% by the public. Although Maxxam consolidates Kaiser’s operations in its financial statements, Kaiser is a subsidiary of Maxxam and has its own assets and liabilities. Subsidiaries are incorporated for this very reason; to create a “corporate veil” between parent and subsidiary. Since the actions creating the asbestos liabilities occurred many years before Maxxam’s ownership, one could not (and has not) assert that Maxxam somehow spun off Kaiser to avoid such liabilities. Maxxam has not been named as a defendant in any asbestos litigation. I have discussed this issue with the company and an attorney knowledgeable in asbestos cases.

4. Maxxam has exposure to the FDIC litigation concerning a failed Texas savings and loan in the late 1980’s.

Actually, in June 2001, the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Resources recommended that the FDIC drop its case against Maxxam and Hurwitz. We believe the case will be officially dismissed in the near term.

5. Pacific Lumber is also highly leveraged, and like Kaiser, could be forced into bankruptcy.

This is true and as shown above, Maxxam’s valuation is highly sensitive to the value of its forest products division, Pacific Lumber Co. I have had the timberlands appraised and am comfortable with the value based on cash flow and on acreage/yield. The lumber company has struggled the last few years as it has had difficulty with the State of California honoring a federal agreement entered into in 1999 regarding permitted annual harvests. Recently, however, Pacific Lumber has made solid progress with California on increasing the run rate of harvested board feet. The value for Pacific Lumber shown in the above chart is net of lumber level debt. In a worst-case scenario, one would recoup more than today’s price of $10 even without Pacific Lumber Co.
Catalyst
I believe that Hurwitz has become fatigued battling a poor public perception and a falling share price. He was hard-pressed to take the company private or sell large assets in the face of the government litigation, which is now essentially (but not officially) resolved. Second, there were many problems at Kaiser Aluminum as it was fighting to avoid Chapter 11. With both of these issues resolved (albeit one unfavorably), I believe we shareholders are within striking distance of an extraordinary corporate event. Is it possible Hurwitz tries to take the company private “on the cheap”? Of course it is. However, with the shares at $11.800, one is likely to make good money in such an event. With a large margin of safety and possibly explosive upside, I recommend purchase of MXM .",0.0,-71.42857051625542,-85.7142852581277,-82.85714294837446,-3.1439570945587976,-14.555225087311358,-24.546845221479437,-9.651809752839071
2020-07-26,Mason,OUT,OUTFRONT MEDIA INC,https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/OUTFRONT_MEDIA_INC/7728201157,2500000000.0,14.35,"Description
  Quick Pitch: We see Outfront Media (“OUT”) as one of the most straightforward COVID recovery plays. OUT is a decent quality company with no liquidity or covenant risk, limited downside, and in a growing demand and constrained supply industry that is secular and could return to 2019 earnings by 2022 or 2023 (if have a vaccine by mid-21). OUT could also benefit from accretive M&A by acquiring distressed assets, but we don’t bake this into our base case.  
Company Description: OUT operates as a public REIT with >5% dividend yield (pre-COVID) and is one of the largest providers of advertising space on Out-of-Home (“OOH”) advertising structures and sites across the U.S. and Canada.  Its portfolio primarily consists of billboard displays in densely populated / major metros, along with transit displays driven by multi-year exclusive contracts in large cities.
Risk/Reward: When there was peak uncertainty in the market and investors were unsure of the liquidity / bankruptcy potential, OUT shares troughed at $8 on March 20th. Since then, a bit more certainty has returned to the world, OUT has renegotiated covenants, juiced up its balance sheet (hence, no liquidity risk and in fact OUT now has capacity to acquire distressed assets), given investors clarity on trough business trends, and has received a $400mm convertible preferred investment from Providence Equity. Shares are unlikely to go back to the March low. Downside is likely somewhere ~$12-13, based on 12x FY21 EBITDA of $344mm and assuming a prolonged recovery by FY23. We see upside @ $25, based on 12x FY19/FY22 EBITDA of $522mm, assuming a recovery by FY22. Note that 12x is where it has historically and consistently traded for over 5 years. This leads to a compelling 5:1 risk/reward skew, w/ ~75% upside and 10-15% downside. This is an extremely straightforward play with minimal downside risks, and patient investors will get paid over the next 12 or so months as business trends return. You’ll get paid with compelling risk/reward even if you aren’t a fan of a LSD-MSD % growing industry and/or have concerns about the industry longer term.
Note that OUT is down ~45% YTD vs. peer LAMR -25% YTD. The main difference here is that LAMR has a predominantly local business skew, where traffic trends have recovered more quickly vs. OUT’s national and transit businesses that generate 37% of rev from NYC and LA alone. As traffic continues to return in OUT’s markets, it will outperform LAMR and even outperform the market. Traffic trends (leading indicator), have been already improving, giving confidence to advertisers to resume spending in OOH markets where eyeballs have returned. Some of LAMR’s local markets have already seen traffic trends above pre-COVID levels, hence LAMR’s outperformance vs. OUT.

Company Description
OUT is a 2014 CBS spinout and operates as a public REIT and is a one of the largest providers of advertising space on Out-of-Home (“OOH”) advertising structures and sites across the U.S. and Canada.  Its portfolio primarily consists of digital and static billboard displays in densely populated / major metros, along with metro transit (buses, subways) displays driven by multi-year exclusive contracts in large cities. Billboard contracts are structured from ~4 weeks to 1 year, though digital is shorter than static. The company currently has ~41K static and 1.1K digital billboards
In FY19, 67% of revenues came from billboards, and 33% from transit. OUT’s largest transit contract is with the NYC MTA. 44% of OUT’s revenues are from “national” markets which include top metros / cities, and ~92% of revenue is from the U.S. NYC and LA account for 37% of revenue (Figure 1). This differs drastically from close peer LAMR, which has 75% of revenue from local and only an 8% transit business.

    OOH Industry Overview: Supply and Demand Dynamics
Out-of-Home ad spend, while only ~4% of total US media spend, is the only non-Internet based ad medium to show material organic growth in recent years, typically tracking GDP growth. This stems from the combined benefits of a growing audience, constrained inventory supply, and increasing use of digital displays and data driven selling. OOH is basically the only part of traditional advertising that’s still growing, not losing share to digital, and had even shown acceleration prior to COVID (Figure 3).
The billboard space is highly regulated, and transit deals typically occur through exclusive multi-year contracts. You can’t just build a billboard anywhere, there are highway (e.g. 1965 Highway Beautification Act) and municipal caps and licenses are heavily regulated, which makes the industry extremely lucrative given consistently growing demand amidst constrained supply. In fact, because of regulation, billboard operators like OUT that own billboard licenses typically have pricing power over the lessors of the land where billboards are located, as government regulations often prohibit anything else from being built on the land. This has given OUT flexibility to renegotiate lease expenses with lessors during the COVID crisis.
The U.S. market has three key players, LAMR, CCO and OUT, with the rest of the industry highly fragmented among ~125 independent companies (Figure 4)
Demand for OOH is secular and continues to grow. Advertisers love this advertising medium because a) it’s good for brand building, b) it’s cost effective vs. other channels (i.e. ~$5 CPM vs. TV @ $17, print @ $25, internet @ $7) (Figure 5), c) targets a true mass audience that continues to grow as traffic grows across the U.S., d) it’s harder for consumers to block out / skip ads, e) brands have full control over the experience, as ads are not surrounded by any other content
OOH has continuously been a stable advertising medium for garnering brand awareness, which is why big brands like APPL, MCD, TMUS, AMEX, UBER, Geico, etc consistently rely on it (Figure 6). AAPL, for example, consistently spends ~10% of its budget on OOH. Because of this, OUT has had 0% churn in its top 10 customers over the past 3 years, and only 6% churn among the top 100.

        Liquidity and Cash Burn
OUT acted quickly to bolster its balance sheet at the onset of the COVID crisis, cut expenses, postponed growth capex investments, raised $400MM via a convertible preferred note with Providence Equity, and cut its dividend to preserve liquidity. This has left the company with availability liquidity of ~$1.3Bn. Even if you bearishly assume OUT revenues are down 50% (which is MGMT’s 2Q guide) for the rest of the year, it would only burn ~$190MM of cash excl. dividends. In addition, the company renegotiated covenants to exclude 2Q/3Q20 EBITDA from its net secured maintenance covenant calculation (4.5x) until September 2021, which has derisked the possibility of a covenant breach.
M&A: Call Option
Given the liquidity situation described above, OUT is in a position to acquire assets from distressed billboard operators, and management has mentioned that they believe COVID-19 will accelerate the industry’s need to consolidate. Though purely speculative, it could make sense for OUT to acquire some of distressed CCO’s assets – often times, CCO and OUT have billboards that are side by side. Such a deal would likely be viewed as highly accretive. This is a pure call option and we don’t bake this into any of our analysis.
Transit and Minimum Guarantee
OUT has ~20 significant transit contracts, the largest which is the NYC MTA. About 1/3 of OUT’s transit revenues are from bus shelters, which are slightly less impacted than below ground travel. However, the other 2/3 will be heavily impacted by COVID. Given the way these transit contracts are structured, OUT has to pay ~$228mm per year in “minimum guarantees,” even if the revenue from transit is below this amount, which is the case vs. OUT’s guided 2Q run-rate transit revenue of $150MM (-75% YoY).  For April and the time being, MGMT mentioned that, in agreement with the MTA, they did not pay their minimum guarantee, are not accruing, and so far have been paying transit fees variably. Going forward, they are still renegotiating their contract to determine how this guarantee flexes. At the end of the day, controversy with OUT’s transit agreements often creates opportunities with the stock as transit is <35% of revenue, even lower margin, and so a relatively smaller part of the value of the company. If they have to pay their minimum guarantee going forward, there may be slightly more cash burn, but this doesn’t change the two year recovery story or create a liquidity issue.
Valuation and Risk/Reward
OUT has historically and consistently traded at 12x fwd EBITDA (Figure 7). Almost all agencies we speak to discuss pent up demand and expect a full 2022 recovery back to 2019 sales if a vaccine is out by 2Q21. Based on this FY22 recovery, 12x FY19/FY22 EBITDA of $522mm would imply a $25 stock by the end of 2021, and the stock will likely get there ahead of that on the pure sentiment of a normalizing market. If you assume a 2023 recovery instead, you’d have a $20 stock by the end of 2021 based on FY22 EBITDA of $460mm, which still gives you a >3:1 risk/reward including dividends, in a pretty conservative scenario. Even in this lagged recovery scenario, if you take 12x FY21 EBITDA of $344mm, you’d have a $13 stock, which is where we see as the absolute bottom.
Coming out of COVID, there may be a few call options, none of which we bake in here: a) accretive M&A of distressed assets, b) accelerated decline of TV/Print/Radio advertising, leading to ad dollars going to secular channels like OOH, though we imagine most of that will go to online.

Bally’s is in the final stages of closing what is a merger of equals with Gamesys group (GYS:LON) out of the UK. As a long time shareholder of Gamesys group (aka Jackpotjoy aka Intertain) I have come to appreciate the fabulous management team that went from a start-up in 2001 to become the 235mm GBP EBITDA, highly cash generative business it is today. Looking to keep my exposure to this business I got up to speed on Ballys and believe today’s trading price provides an attractive entry point.
Once the merger is complete sometime in Q4, the company can be valued on a SOTP: the brick and mortar regional casino business of Bally’s, the Gamesys assets and the igaming opportunity. At today’s price we are effectively getting the I-gaming optionality for free, despite large investments being made into the Sinclair relationship.
Ballys must appreciate this management group as well, as it is rare to see the CEO of the acquired business go on to run the combined entity.  As well, Gamesys founders and management have elected to take the share exchange option on buyout, which at current prices works out to 12.00 GBP vs the 18.50 GBP cash offer for independent shareholders such as myself. For management to get the same value as independent shareholders, they will need to drive Ballys stock up 54% from these levels.  With the pending deal close expected in October or November the time to get up to speed on the name is now.
  Quick summary of the 3 businesses:
  Gamesys
Gamesys is a leading operator of online casino and bingo led brands. Roughly 58% of the business is in the UK, 30% in Asia, 9% Europe and 3% ROW/America. It has previously been written up 3 times on VIC, first by Avahaz in 2016 (when it was trading in Canada as Intertain), by myself in 2018 (when it was trading in the UK as Jackpotjoy) and most recently in 2019 by gary9 as Gamesys (GYS:LON). I will provide a brief timeline of the important corporate events since its founding in 2001:
  2001
Gamesys founded by Noel Hayden (CEO) Andrew Dixon and Robin Tombs
  2008
Lee fenton joins GYS as COO
            2013
Bought virgin games, entered into long term deal to use the brand rights globally
  2015
Sold Jackpotjoy to ITX for 425mm GBP
          2015
Noel Hayden becomes exec chairman, Lee Fenton takes over as CEO
      Robeson Reeves assumes COO role (been with GYS since 2004)
    2019
JPJ/ITX buys rest of Gamesys for another 490mm GBP, half stock half cash
    Lee Fenton and Robeson Reeves become CEO and COO of JPJ/GYS
    2021
Ballys to buy GYS for 2.7bil USD. Lee Fenton to be combined CEO, Reeves to become director
  Bally CEO George Papnier to become head of B&M under Fenton
      All in, the founder Noel Hayden has cashed out about 335mm GBP by my count, and still retains 15mm shares which at the cash offer takeout price is currently worth 278mm GBP. He’s done alright for himself. 
  This entire business was grown using internally generated capital. They should grow EBITDA to 235mm GBP this year, which is up from 158.4mm in 2019 (22% CAGR last two years). Revenue should come in at 829mm which is up from 505mm in 2018, good for a 3 year CAGR of 18%. They did this by being leaders in the space, first through online bingo led sites.
    Gamesys was a covid beneficiary as people stuck at home tend to gamble more. I provided the long term numbers to show it has been a consistent grower and is not just a covid beneficiary. Historically Gamesys has been a 10-15% top line grower with last year the exception at 28.7%. Growth should come in at 14% this year. In H1 ’21 growth came in at 17% but this was heavily weighted towards Q1 where it was 27% and we saw tough comps result in an implied 7% growth rate for Q2 ’21. That said, this was the toughest comp of the year, and management recently disclosed in a proxy statement that their application for the deal financing was forecasting close to 18% revenue growth in 2021. 
Margins are very stable, with most of the costs being variable. Adjusted ebitda margins should be just north of 30%. Note margins were a bit higher before UK POCT changes in 2019 which resulted in a one time step down (taxes taken here are above ebitda line item.
Capex is extremely light, being an IP business, they run 3%. ROIC is off the charts (literally) if we back out intangibles and goodwill. Hard long term assets were 46mm at year end and with negative working capital, the denominator in the ROIC calculation is negative. 
    The company is a well run cash machine with dominate market share, that has consistently grown. No wonder Ballys wanted it, and it’s management team for their I-gaming push.
  Ballys:
  Ballys is a regional casino rollup play. They currently have 16 properties in 15 different states. It was initially called Twin River Casino, and had been private until 2019 when it did a reverse takeover of publicly listed Dover downs. It is partially controlled by its chairman, Soo Kim who’s hedge fund Standard General is the largest owner at 23%. They acquired their stake in 2016 while it was still private. As you can see below they have been very active on the roll-up strategy, particularly during 2020 when multiples were reasonable.
    The company talks about the total properties having done pro forma north of 300mm in EBITDA in 2019 and with some capex having been put into the properties since that time, expect them to be above that number under normalized conditions.
In Q2 Ballys generated 83.8mm EBITDA (including corp expenses and some online losses) so they are clearly on track for that number. I don’t view this as a great growth business like Gamesys, but should be a stable cash generative business with easy to transact assets. The company has pursued a mixed real estate model where they own over 2/3rds of their properties but have recently funded some acquisitions through sale-leasebacks. Long term they will continue to own a minimum of half their real estate with the rest available for financing should the need arise. 
I model the B&M segment to do 312mm in cash EBITDA in 2022 (ebitda – rent expense), pretty much flat from this year. Most casinos have been over earning in Q2 and Q3 as guests have come back, but marketing and service levels (read costs) are down. This isn’t sustainable long term (though management claims some of the labor savings are) so I model a return to more normal margin levels. 
  The company is led by CEO George Papanier who has been with Ballys since 2004 first as COO and then CEO. Post merger he will effectively be the President of the B&M division, which is sort of a demotion but more in line with his skill sets. Sellside analysts I spoke to describe him as very competent. While he isn’t a star he is good at the blocking and tackling of running a casino. We aren’t reinventing the wheel here.
  I-Gaming:

With the 2018 Supreme court decision to allow individual states to legalize sports betting, there has been a slow roll out state by state of legislation. The bigger players in the industry have all been preparing to make a push into what is effectively a land grab in this nascent industry. While a small opportunity today, the TAM at maturity if all states were to legalize is a gross gaming revenue of anywhere from 20 to 50 billion, based off extrapolations from what the earlier states to have legalized are seeing today. 
Bally’s has thrown their hat into the ring as well, and has stated they are aiming for a 10% market share in the states where they operate. Generally, an online operator is required to have a B&M presence, or partnership with a B&M operator, to gain an online license. Therefore having a large, diverse footprint is beneficial as it gives you a broader reach. This is partially why Ballys pursued an aggressive M&A strategy. You can see here the states they are positioned in:
Of course, just having a license doesn’t guarantee success. Acquiring customers is hard and requires a lot of marketing and media. Many of the I-gaming companies are now entering relationships with sports media to gain an edge, which we first saw when Stars group (now part of Flutter) entered into an agreement with Fox sports.
  Bally’s has taken their shot, after announcing last November a comprehensive deal with Sinclair and their vast collection of local and sports stations. In total, 21 of the regional sports networks acquired as part of the Fox/Disney forced divestment will be rebranded Bally sports, and the 190 local TV stations Sinclair owns will promote the Bally sports brands through integrated marketing and product info. There will be custom betting content embedded into programing on the RSN assets, and a heavy advertising component. In exchange Sinclair becomes one of the largest owners of Ballys stock through newly issued penny warrants and performance warrants. 
  The rebranding has already occurred, with the RSNs now called Ballysports. Ballys is in the process of rebranding their land based casinos over to the Ballys name to support the full integration of assets. And Ballys believes that can tap the 14mm customers in their loyalty databases as a cheap way to start onboarding customers to the I-gaming platform.
  This was actually the genesis of the Gamesys acquisition. According to the filing the two management teams began discussions last December about exploring different partnerships. Ballys has the physical B&M presence, whereas Gamesys management has the digital expertise. Gamesys was looking for a way into the US market. In the end Ballys decided that it would make sense to buy out all of Gamesys and have Lee Fenton run the combined enterprise. 
  In my numbers I assume they can roll out to the 10 states that Ballys has a physical presence in who have legalized I-gaming. I assume they are launched in H2 2022 in these states and can get a 5% marketshare (lower than managements 10% estimate). I value this division on a sales basis, given it will still be running small losses at that point in time. I use 5x my 2023 sales estimate discounted back to today. 5x seems fair as the division will be growing in excess of 100% yoy and is generally a 75% gross margin business (Gamesys is a 30% EBITDA margin business, so margins at scale are healthy). Draftkings, one of the only publicly traded pure-plays going after the online gaming market in the US, currently trades for 11x 2023 sales. The Score, which is in the process of being acquired by Penn, was taken out at what could be described 80x the forecasted 2023 revenues from the 4 states they were launched in. I think those last two examples are ridiculous, but included them to highlight that 5x revenue is reasonable for the growth rate an opportunity, and this would translate into 16.67x scale EBITDA.
  To be fair this is all a bit of a guessing game at this point, but the opportunity is real, the investments and relationships are already on track and the plan makes sense. At this stock price I think you are getting this upside for free. If management does hit their 10% market share target this division could be worth $40 a share in 2023. 
  It’s worth pointing out there are some heavy hitters in this space with Penn National, MGM, Caesars, Flutter and Draftkings all expected to make a strong push and go after market share. As well, Ballys may be a bit late as they put their beta rollout of ballysports.com on pause until the Gamesys acquisition closes and the new management team can take the reins. That may be a blessing in disguise though as this fall is expected to be a bloodbath on the marketing spend for the upcoming NFL season amongst all the entrants. 
    Valuation:
  At today’s price of $50, we have decent upside to $66 based on a SOTP, good for 32% upside today. However, I believe with the long term growth of Gamesys, and the natural delevering from cash flow next year there is long term upside to these numbers.

    Why its cheap:
  I do not believe US investors are familiar with the management team of Gamesys or the great success they have building up the business over the last two decades. Instead they view the international component as overly complex to what was a relatively clean play before on a B&M regional casino operator with an I-gaming angle. 

As well, given the quantity of M&A done in the past two years, there are integration questions. While this one is more difficult to disprove, I view the Gamesys assets and management as phenomenal and a big addition to the story. In fact I wouldn’t be considering the stock if not for the pending merger. 
  Risks:
  The biggest risk to me is the ongoing UK review of the 2005 gambling act. The UK represents about 60% of Gamesys revenues and therefore 35% of the pro forma EBITDA. The UK is in the middle of this review of the rules and regulations of the gaming sector with online a big portion of the discussion. There was a 16 week call for evidence which ended March 31st and we are now waiting for a white paper to be published by the UK government later this year.
  The conversation about changes needed to the industry have been broad, but I calculate the odds of a material negative event for Gamesys as low. In 2019 UK lawmakers did make adjustments to the gambling act which were quite punitive. These included setting much lower maximum stakes in fixed odds betting terminals, tighter age and identity checks, banning credit cards to deposit funds online and most punitively, changing the off the top point of consumption tax from 15% to 21%. 
  The conversation this time around seems to be much more focused on protecting consumers rather than taxing gaming companies. Many of the conversations seem to be around advertising restrictions and stricter paperwork requirements. However law makers do seem to want to strike a balance on protection for problem gamblers and putting up too much red tape for ordinary people. You can read the transcript of a parliamentary debate here for July.
https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2021-07-22/debates/1EBFA6A1-69E4-4D37-A089-FC92DDCF27DB/ReviewOfTheGamblingAct2005
  Many of the changes being discussed (such as banning sports sponsorships) would have minimal impact of Gamesys. I also doubt regulators would consider raising the POCT again, as this just occurred and I haven’t come across any serious conversations about that being on the table this time around, however it is always a risk. It’s worth noting in 2019 when the last changes came into effect, the end results was some of the smaller, weaker operators could not absorb these changes and the market leaders only got stronger.
  Another risk to me would be grey markets. Gamesys currently generates 32% of their revenue from Asia, and that has been the geography with the biggest growth. The largest market within Asia by far is Japan, and here Gamesys operates in a gray zone. They are not violating any laws operating as they are but it is always possible regulations come into force which would create a licensed framework and gamesys would risk losing share. It happened to them before in Sweden when the market switched from grey to regulated in 2019 and Gamesys lost share. However in Japan Vera and John now have good brand recognition and if the market did become licensed they would have an edge on new comers. 
  And of course, how could a risk section be complete in 2021 without saying Covid. This clearly would impact the B&M casinos, though Gamesys assets would benefit by renewed lockdowns in the UK. 
  Conclusion:
  I believe with Bally’s you are getting a phenomenal business in Gamesys, a simple but cash generative business in Ballys, and free upside optionality should Ballys win significant I-gaming market share. The combined entity is being led by a great incoming management team that the street in North America is not appreciating. While leverage is currently high, the highly cash generative assets will lead to leverage coming down to reasonably levels over the coming quarters. The stock will likely trade around these levels until the deal closes, but I expect it to start trading higher in 2022 as more and more states are rolled out in the I-gaming market and incoming management hits the road to tell the story.

2019-10-17,Element119,TCNNF,TRULIEVE CANNABIS CORP,https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/TRULIEVE_CANNABIS_CORP/1709399820,1125000000.0,10.14,"Description
Trulieve (CSE: TRUL / OTC: TCNNF)
Pitch: As the clear market share leader in the Florida medical cannabis market, Trulieve is poised to beat consensus expectations for revenue growth of ~75% per annum over the 2018 to 2021 period and for >40% EBITDA margins, yet trades at less than 6x 2020 EBITDA vs. US comps at 8-12x and Canadian comps at 12-20x. Unlike the vast majority of cannabis companies which have attempted to enter as many markets as possible to capture future optionality, Trulieve has built a high ROIC operation in the leading medical cannabis state and taken a methodical approach to new market entrance. With a net cash balance sheet, access to debt, and already generating positive cash flow from operations, Trulieve is poised to capitalize on the eventual opening of the recreational cannabis market in Florida as well as enter new US markets as appropriate – in aggregate, this represents a greater than $80BN opportunity. The companies perception as a “one-state operator”, low trading liquidity and the general lack of access to traditional capital pools is driving the discounted valuation. We believe that both strong operational results as well as increased access to capital via a combination of new federal level cannabis legislation and the entrance of new investors into the sector in the absence of new legislation will lead to a valuation more appropriate for a business with this margin and growth profile.
Background: There is quite a bit of attention paid to cannabis markets globally as countries and individual US states move out of decades of prohibition and into regulated medical – and in some cases recreational – marijuana consumption regimes.  While Canada has the unique position of being the only developed nation with a federally-legal and robust legal marijuana program, 33 US states have legalized medical cannabis and 11 have legalized recreational cannabis. Canadian investors have reflected a strong interest in funding these businesses and Canadian exchanges have become the go-to place to raise public capital for cannabis companies pursuing both domestic and international strategies.  More specifically, for cannabis-touching companies operating in the US, the Canadian Stock Exchange (CSE), and the US OTC markets are the only stock exchanges where they can currently list. This inefficiency severely limits the aggregate pool of investors and access to capital for these US businesses, at a time when they require significant growth capital. This, in turn, has led to depressed valuations for these US-based companies when compared to either their stand-alone financial profile or when compared to Canadian peer company valuations who have been able to list on the NYSE, NASDAQ or TSX exchanges. While it is not necessary for our thesis to play out on Trulieve, it is our view that this dynamic will evolve as the US Federal government adopts more accommodative policies, such as the SAFE Banking Act and/or the STATES Act, opening traditional financial conduits and leading to a meaningful re-rating in valuations for US cannabis companies as they up-list and new pools of capital chase the investment opportunity.
Thesis:
·         Trulieve went public in September 2018, and is the leading medical cannabis company in Florida with over 55% YTD market share, more than twice the share of the next closest competitor (Source: FL OMMU). Trulieve is also developing assets in 3 other states, including California, Connecticut and Massachusetts  (note: there is currently no inter-state commerce for cannabis, nor is there expected to be any with federal legislative change, so each State operates as a separate and distinct market)
·         The FL market is tightly controlled with only 21 licensed entities, of which only 11 are operating today. Of those operating today, only 6 operators have more than 10 stores, and only 3 operators have more than 20 stores. Trulieve currently has 35 dispensaries open and is licensed for a total of 49 dispensaries, more than any other operator. The majority of operators are limited to 35 dispensary locations,  but through a court challenge, Trulieve and a select few early operators were awarded additional licenses (https://news.wjct.org/post/state-settles-trulieve-over-marijuana-dispensary-caps)
·         As mandated by State regulations, all FL medical cannabis operations must also be vertically-integrated from seed-to-sale, meaning they must each cultivate, process, package, distribute, retail and deliver cannabis flower and value-added products across the State. Trulieve also has the largest production and distribution footprint in the State, which is a meaningful competitive advantage as the lack of a wholesale market means every operator must produce all their products in-house, and is thus the key limiter to growth. Trulieve has over 1.6MM sq ft of cultivation capacity that generates over 55,000 kg’s per year of cannabis biomass, which is over 3x as large as their closest competitors.  They are also actively expanding that capacity to reach nearly 65,000 kg’s per year by this fall.
·         Another competitive advantage, Trulieve has the broadest set of SKU’s with more than 240 as compared to the competition which averages less than 50 SKU’s. The company’s expertise and speed-to-market in product development is unmatched in the industry, and means Trulieve is a trail-blazer and is often the only operator in the State with the products demanded by consumers. For example, Trulieve has over 100 varieties of vape/cartridge products where most other operators have less than 10 offerings. Trulieve is also the only operator which has sufficient indoor cultivation capacity (vast majority are greenhouse cultivators) to supply the high-end dry flower market, which is a high margin product category and allows Trulieve to solidify themselves as a high-quality brand.
·         The market currently has 272,000 active patients which supports a ~US$700MM annual market today. More mature medical cannabis markets typically cap out at between 2-3% of the population registered – at 2.5% that would represent ~550,000 total potential medical patients in the program, leaving 100% upside to the aggregate market size, representing a ~$1.4BN market opportunity. This aggregate market size would also move higher upon the introduction of edibles, which alongside Florida’s program that has low barriers to entry for patients (1 week and ~$200-300 for a medical card), would likely expand the market to ~4% or ~850,000 patients, representing a $2.2BN market opportunity.
·         Trulieve has established itself as the market share leader with ~55% of the YTD market share, and with ~50% of the most recent month market share (in terms of grams sold), based on their leading footprint, largest production capacity, and through their unparalleled customer outreach platform which include numerous community events and over 100,000 social medial followers. They’ve established a first mover advantage via establishing the first cannabis dispensary in 19 of 29 regional markets, have a fleet of 75 delivery cars, and as such, maintain the only real full-distributed brand in the state.
·         The steady market growth as well as their firm leadership position and tight operational control has translated into significant visibility on revenue and EBITDA. In April, Trulieve provided guidance for 2019 and 2020, which to date they are safely tracking ahead of:
·         2019: $220MM to $240MM in revenue at 40.0% EBITDA margins
·         2020: $380MM to $400MM in revenue at 38.5% EBITDA margins
·         In H1/19, Trulieve generated revenue of $102MM and $51MM of EBITDA for a 49% margin. Consensus expectations called for $38MM EBITDA, representing a beat of 34%, the only major cannabis company to beat by double digits. Today, consensus expectations are calling for FY2019 revenue of $240MM and EBITDA of $108MM for margins of just 45%, but based on management commentary and the OMMU data that drives my model, Trulieve is again tracking well ahead of 2019 numbers.
·         I conservatively model H2/19 revenue of $174MM and $77MM in EBITDA  implying 44% EBITDA margins vs. H2/19 expectations for $138MM in revenue and $57MM in EBITDA, which implies a back-half EBITDA beat of 35%
·         For additional detail, you can arrive at an estimate for FL-based revenue by taking the weekly OMMU data, multiplying total MG’s sold x $0.12/MG and total Oz’s sold x $12/gram (x28 grams/Oz), a conservative avg price per unit based on Trulieve’s entire product portfolio
·         I also assume that edibles have no impact on financials this year, despite early indications they will be allowed in Q4 and finally, that there is zero growth or additional contribution from Trulieve’s CA or CT assets. MA, which is in the final stages of its build-out, won’t generate revenue until Q1/20.
  ·         As it relates to 2020, in their home market of FL we have seen at least 4 other operators state publically that they will be slowing down their investment in the state to refocus resources on their respective home markets. This is largely driven by the fact that mandatory vertical integration in FL means the capital intensity to stand up a profitable business is significant, and at the same time there has been a protracted downturn in the broader cannabis investment market where new financings have dried up. Of course, demand growth in the state is only increasing, leaving the top players to capitalize on the growth of the market.
  ·         Based on my model, which conservatively has Trulieve growing at half the rate of the overall market in 2020, the business can generate $400MM from FL alone, before edibles. Assuming edibles launch January 1, 2020, that number increases by at least 10%. Adding CA, CT, and just 6 months of contribution from the MA production asset, adds $40-60MM to that total, for a 2020 forecast revenue range of $480-500MM, and at 38.5% a mid-point conservative EBITDA estimate of $190MM.
  ·         At Trulieve’s current share price of $12.50, that represents a valuation of 5.3x 2020E EBITDA vs. US comps at 8-12x and Canadian comps at 12-20x. Importantly, the company is not only cash flow positive before capex today, but the company’s capital plan is fully funded with current cash and debt facilities. The company will be strongly FCF positive by Q1/20 when the expansion based capex from FL and MA largely finish in Q4/19.
  ·         We believe that the combination of continued strong operational results, results which will meaningfully beat current analyst estimates, will push TRUL shares to trade alongside their US peers, leading to a potential 80-120% upside. If the traditional conduits for capital are opened as they are for their Canadian peers, that upside increases to 120-200% upside. Finally, if the Florida market turns recreationally legal and/or Trulieve accretively enters new markets, the upside is further still.
  ·         The risks largely relates to key man risk in the CEO, Kim Rivers, who leads both operational activities and is the key investor facing company representative. Also, any negative regulatory change on the state or federal level must be watched closely, although we feel that legislation is already quite burdensome and will likely improve over time, with the potential for i) removal of mandatory vertical integration in FL, ii) the opening of the recreational market in FL, and iii) at the Federal level, the SAFE Banking Act and/or STATES Act in the next 1-3 years.
         I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.
Catalyst
o   First, continued operational execution and realizing results ahead of consensus expectations should allow a lift in shares, without needed an increase in multiple. However, if they are generating margins and FCF well ahead of peers, I would expect the multiple to also increase, at least commensurate with US regional peers.
o   an opening of the medical market to allow wholesaling as well as retail-only or cultivation-only players would allow a significant step-up in the retail storefronts in the State, which may have a modest impact on price, but would allow Trulieve to instantly increase their distribution from 49 stores to over 200 locations (or more depending on new openings)
  o   the opening of a recreational market in FL would take the total market size from ~US$1.4BN to ~$6BN nearly over night, based on the average per capita purchases from other US States which has relaively mature recreational cannabis markets such as CO, CA and OR.",1.5533965480508796,-9.12621860825958,112.71844118139691,298.05824505596263,9.717977038834235,-5.066458581763596,17.887891001036436,37.72077159172002
2021-07-28,Helm56,PDEX,PRO-DEX INC/CO,https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/PRO-DEX_INCCO/6966685997,117000000.0,29.45,"Description
Situation overview
Pro-Dex offers a compelling growth story in the form of a capital-light long-term compounder with strong expense discipline, positive net income and cash generation, and a culture focused on repeatable process in the generation of new business opportunities.  While it may appear at first glance that PDEX’s bright future has been priced in (19x trailing P/E and multiples of stock price expansion over the last few years), this valuation gives credit only for the performance already delivered and not for the research/consult/design/produce/market/sell flywheel that the company has built and continues to refine.  The significant increase in the stock price over the last six years is best understood as the transition from “broken problem company priced for disaster” to “apparently fixed company showing promise.”
  The company has generated EBIT/TCE exceeding 30% in three of the last four fiscal years and a trailing 12-month ROE of ~30%.  My conservative base case results in a 20%+ annualized return to equity holders over a several-year period as PDEX utilizes its flywheel to grow profitably into a market opportunity exceeding $1 billion.  The company’s board is chaired by investor Nick Swenson who appears to agree, given that he allowed the company to spend $4mm repurchasing shares at an average price of $25.04 in the most recently reported quarter.



Company and industry overview
Pro-Dex, Inc. specializes in the design, development, and manufacture of autoclavable (i.e. can be heat/steam-sterilized), battery-powered and electric, multi-function surgical drivers (e.g. to set screws when installing surgical plates) and surgical shavers.  The company is based in Irvine, CA and employs approximately 120 people.
  “Expert” forecasts for growth in surgical procedures and sales of surgical devices range mostly from mid to high single digits driven by population increases, increase in aged population, rising wealth and obesity levels, development of less-invasive surgical procedures, and a seemingly increasing rate of injury.  Pro-Dex’s two latest drivers represent nearly half of its revenue and are used in craniomaxillofacial (“CMF”) and thoracic surgery procedures.  I don’t pretend to be able to size these markets with precision, but surveying a number of different (again, “expert”) reports indicates a CMF device market of $1.5 to $2 billion and a thoracic device market of $5 billion to $7 billion.  However, these figures include surgical equipment other than drivers/shavers such as forceps, spreaders, etc., so only a portion is relevant to PDEX.  The overall market (across applications) for powered handpieces is likely closer to $2 billion, which is in-line with the company’s statement that its addressable market is $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion.  The remainder of PDEX’s device revenue is used in orthopedic surgery which reaches across a few of these body-part categories.  Importantly, the company is continuing to develop new solutions for additional body parts, which will give it access to more of the overall orthopedic device market, which is several tens of billions of dollars.  However, I expect PDEX to continue to focus on areas where it can offer a differentiated solution rather than running at giant market segments that attract large amounts of capital.  With TTM medical device revenue of ~$38mm (including repairs), there is plenty of headroom for growth any way you slice it (at 5% growth, a billion dollar market will create an additional PDEX each year).
  PDEX has historically sold its products mainly to large manufacturers and distributors of medical devices (more below on how they are expanding out from this).  These (often large) customers seek out Pro-Dex rather than building in-house because the company has two decades of experience designing and building handpieces and getting them through the FDA approval process, and has enough credibility that the time/expense/hassle of building in-house isn’t justified (still, the company states that it sees inhousing as its largest competitive threat).  This is particularly true for companies whose expertise is consumables like plates and screws but who want a private-label driver to sell with their consumables.  As one might expect, the resulting revenue can be sticky.  In December 2009 the company’s then-largest customer informed Pro-Dex that the customer would be insourcing production of the product that they were buying at that time from PDEX.  Even so, Pro-Dex was still supplying this customer with product in FY12 and repair services for another year after that.
  The company has a few immaterial vestigial revenue lines that are either being run without any marketing effort (industrial and scientific) or being gradually wound down (dental and component).  TTM revenue is just about $40mm with net income of $6.1mm (~15% net income margin and 37% gross margin).  Capex is light at $500k to $1mm / year and the company carries ~$13mm in debt bearing interest at under 4%, of which ~$5mm is a property loan due 2030 and the remainder is due 2027 under a credit facility.  PDEX has diluted wtd avg shares of 3.97mm (mkt cap of $117mm at $29.45 stock price) and ~$8mm of cash and investments.


How we got here
googie974’s July 2014 writeup provides a good summary of what the company used to be - a dirt-cheap struggling business that had just lost half of its revenue and was in the midst of trying to turn itself around.  In its prior life, the company had highly compensated and ineffective management, minimal marketing efforts, a focus on contract manufacturing rather than product development, weak control over its IP, was in some cases simply a component supplier, and had made a number of bolt-on acquisitions that turned out to be unsuccessful and were wound down or sold.
  The Pro-Dex of today is the result of a significant amount of blocking and tackling by the current management team (headed by CEO Rick Van Kirk, previously director of manufacturing, vp of operations, and COO) and under the supervision of Nick Swenson and Raymond Cabillot.  A few key differences include:
  ---Instead of being a contract manufacturer that produces products (using customer-owned IP) that customers have already spec’d out, Pro-Dex now focuses on developing its own IP and turning it into products that are a good fit for (and can be marketed to) multiple customers.
  ---Instead of waiting by the phone for potential customers to call with contract work (the general strategy under the old management team), PDEX now has a functional and intelligently incentivized marketing and business development team that works to increase penetration of existing customers by securing introductions to customers’ colleagues in other divisions as well as calls on potential new customers to sell PDEX’s existing products (this has a much shorter sales cycle than a joint development project).
  ---Instead of pursuing low-value industrial and component work “because it’s revenue,” the company seeks out higher value medical device opportunities (such as its leading-edge torque-limiting driver software) in order to create the most value from its assets and expertise.
  ---Instead of making poorly conceived acquisitions that might be a good fit, Pro-Dex uses its intimate knowledge of its customers and its own capabilities to invest in its own research (using the kind of prioritization and with a willingness to make difficult tradeoffs that one would expect from a company that is intelligently controlling expenses).
  ---Instead of a generally lackadaisical approach, the company is focused on constantly trying things.  In fact, their internal motto is “we try things.”  The CEO takes a lot of pride in the fact that they’ve created a collegial environment where ideas can be thrown around, debated, and executed on without political/fiefdom-related obstacles.


Where we are now
So where do all these improvements over the old way of doing things leave us?  The most succinct way I can describe the investment thesis is that PDEX is not cheap on a recent earnings basis, but is cheap because the company has a very significant asset that does not appear on the balance sheet.
  This asset is the flywheel formed by Pro-Dex’s expertise, culture, processes, and incentives, which will result in significant revenue growth, margin accretion, and excess cash generation going forward.  While I may end up eating these words, in my mind this is different from just buying a company with a rosy outlook and strong execution because (i) Management’s joy and focus seems to be more on process than on any individual strategies, products, or ideas, and (ii) this flywheel has already started to deliver as evidenced by the company’s ~77% cumulative revenue growth since FY18 and ~279% net income growth over the same period.  While the market has certainly given the company credit for its recent strong performance (the stock is priced at 19x trailing earnings), this price still undervalues how far the company can go in the surgical driver and shaver space, and how solid its execution is likely to be in iterating its way there, given that my conservative base case offers an annual return to equity holders of over 20% (presumably for a long time).
  For a few expected wins that are a little more concrete than just “this team is going to iterate their way to success”:
  ---Torque-limiting applications.  PDEX’s above-mentioned two recent products both use the company’s leading edge (and patented) “adaptive torque-limiting” software, meaning that the driver can sense and adjust torque to ensure a properly seated screw in a variety of applications (different body parts, different screws, old people bones, young people bones, etc.).  This technology took a few years of significant investment to develop and appears to be a differentiator (vs drivers that are programmed to rotate a screw a prescribed number of turns or the historical method of the surgeon hand-tightening the screw after entering it most of the way with the driver).  This technology will serve as a platform that PDEX can customize for a variety of incremental procedures and body parts.
  ---Sales in Europe.  Pro-Dex has been working for a while on achieving CE marks and other required approvals to sell its products in Europe.
  ---Development of sales relationships with surgery centers and hospital systems.
  ---Improved “R” (of R&D) and increased manufacturing capacity in new building.  In November 2020 the company purchased a 25,000 square foot building (about the same size as its existing facility for ~$6.5mm) near its existing building.  In addition to increasing manufacturing capacity, this new facility will improve the company’s ability to drive its flywheel with more room to perform product ideation and iteration.  Initially, the company is excited about building out a clean room, developing disposable products, and dedicating space to improving the implementation of batteries in its products.
  ---Additional products.  The company says it has several irons in the fire as far as new products.  One of these is a ventilator that was an opportunistic project:  JPL published a mostly complete design and PDEX has been able to create a shippable product from the design (expect to start shipping CQ122 and generate $1.5mm of annual revenue).  Another is an ENT-focused shaver expected to launch CQ421 and generate annual revenue of $1mm.



Valuation / expected returns
Downside case
Admittedly, two factors currently prevent PDEX from being a “bet the farm” investment.  While the overall probability-weighted distribution of potential outcomes appears highly attractive (especially over longer time periods), the high level of customer concentration (discussed below in “Risks”) and the full valuation relative (importantly) to historical earnings means that there is a potential for a significant decline in the stock price if the market either overreacts to what appears to be an operational misstep or if PDEX somehow loses a big chunk of business with one of its top customers (again, see “Risks” below).  It would be disingenuous for me to write that a temporary impairment in this stock of more than 50% would surprise me (though I’d likely say that about most microcaps).
  However, given that most of the value in this investment opportunity is in the future monetization of the ideate/design/market/sell flywheel that the company has developed over the last few years, losing a piece of existing business or experiencing a near-term downward re-rating of the stock represents a temporary setback and lengthening of the time to resolution rather than a breaking of the thesis.  If your time horizon is multi-year, risk management for this name is leaving dry powder to buy more at a lower valuation rather than passing on it completely.


Base case
As the company expands by (a) growing its volumes with existing customers, (b) finding new customers for its legacy and recently-developed products, and (c) continuing to work with prospective customers to design new products that will already be contracted for sale at the moment development is complete (including in adjacent parts of the body to its traditional product lines), at least 25% and possibly as much as 50% of incremental revenue can flow to net income due to the company’s focus on tight expense control and prioritization of higher margins in evaluating new opportunities.
  In my base case, the company adds $4 million of incremental revenue per year in the near-term of which 25% falls to net income (vs adding $4.7mm in FY19 with a 54% contribution margin and adding $7.7mm in FY20 with a 26% contribution margin).  This results in net income growing at just over 16% which, when combined with the ~5% current earnings yield, delivers a return to equity of ~21.5%.  While a 20% annual return is not shoot the lights out territory, the fact that this is a potential hold-forever, compound-forever stock makes this return much more attractive over the long term than something that will deliver a near-term pop to fair value and then need to be sold.  Also to be clear, I think that this is a reasonable base case and that there is upside potential well in excess of what I’ve laid out, both on the revenue side and on the contribution margin side (not to mention potential stock buybacks or other shareholder friendly uses of excess cash).
  I’ll reiterate that if you are reading this and thinking that the current yield is tight and price could go down “just because” before PDEX has the chance to deliver significant earnings growth, I don’t disagree, especially given how all over the place valuations for device companies large and small appear at the moment.  However, again given the hold-forever nature of this now-repaired business, I am happy owning it here and would welcome the opportunity to buy more at lower prices.
  Also for what it’s worth (maybe not much), management expects to double the size of the company in five years and this outcome would not surprise me at all (in fact, I think it will happen).  If they accomplish this, returns will far exceed my base case.


Key Risks
Customer concentration: There is no getting around the fact that the very high level of concentration in Pro-Dex’s customer base introduces a few potential scenarios where revenue and earnings take a significant step backwards.  While the company is very tight-lipped about which of its largest customers are actually (citing confidentiality agreements) the top couple (several customers are listed in its investor presentation and include Smith & Nephew, Medtronic, Conmed, Stryker, KLS Martin, RTI Surgical, Arthrex, DePuy Synthes, and Storz Medical), its largest customer currently represents ~45% of company revenue while the second largest is ~39%.  Although I discuss above in “valuation” why I think a falling out with a major customer doesn’t necessarily tank the investment, it’s also worth discussing here a bit how the company is managing this risk (i.e. reducing the likelihood of one of these scenarios).  In short, (i) “watching that basket” and (ii) incentivizing itself (an important distinction from “trying” or “wanting”) to find new baskets.
  With respect to “watching the basket(s),” the company benefits from the very painful experience of not sufficiently watching a basket in the past (under a prior management team) and losing its then-largest customer.  In FY11, PDEX generated revenue of ~$27mm, of which ~45% was provided by this customer.  This customer decided to insource the manufacturing of the products that PDEX supplied to them causing (in concert with a couple of other issues) the company’s revenue to decline to $10.8mm by FY14 (this was about the time when PDEX was last written up on this site, as a dirt cheap broken situation that had a chance of recovering).  As a result of almost disappearing during that time period, the company today spends significant energy servicing their top customers “like mad” and believes they are considered a critical supplier.  The company is also proactive about obtaining future volume commitments from these customers, having just extended its contract (including volume minimums) with its largest customer for the next 4.5 years (through CY2025).
  In terms of finding new baskets, perhaps the most important thing to know is that the CEO’s bonus compensation is dependent on hitting the overall budget plan and, more importantly, growing the percentage of PDEX’s revenue represented by its smaller customers.  The CEO has in turn passed that incentive down to the sales staff who are incentivized in part on selling into new customers and markets, and the company’s newer product designs.
  I’ll note that customer concentration can work in the company’s favor as well given its current size and the revenue opportunity that an individual customer product contract can represent within only a few years.  For example, the ~$33mm of TTM revenue represented by PDEX’s top two customers was only less than $9mm in FY16.
  Finally, while I think the risk of again losing a significant amount of revenue with a top customer is low, it is worth noting that in the FY11 to FY14 period when revenue declined ~60%, the company was able to cut operating expenses by ~45%, resulting in an operating loss of only ~800k in FY14.  This kind of resiliency is what we’re looking for from a long-term compounder - the ability not only to invest in accretive new opportunities, but to survive any of the bumps that occur along the way.
  Increased competition: While it appears that PDEX has done an admirable job in recent years making sure that it is carving out a defensible niche, both by keeping its customers happy (revenue to PDEX’s largest customer has doubled since FY17, while revenue to customer #2 is up more than 6x) and by providing market leading products, competitors could devise alternate approaches that skirt the company’s IP (the most valuable IP at present appears to be the company’s torque-limiting software).  PDEX’s small size could be an “innovator’s dilemma”-type advantage here in that they can invest significant resources into a market that might not be worthwhile to a larger device company.
  Potential FDA-related issue: No specific risks (the company states that “no claim has been made to date by the FDA regarding any of our products or processes”), but always something to be aware of with device companies.
  The flywheel...just stops working: The problem with betting on a company’s intrinsics.  Everything I’ve learned about the company implies that they have built a very efficient machine to engage with customers and find opportunities to partner on new products with attractive economics.  However, to deliver my base case return, the machine has to keep working (note that this is lower risk than betting on a machine that has not yet worked at all).
  Large shareholders: Chairman Nick Swenson owns 27% of the company’s shares and Director Raymond Cabillot with Farnam Street Partners owns 11% of the shares.  Thus far the active involvement of these two over the last several years has been extremely beneficial (potentially existential).  However, with their large holdings they could potentially influence the company in a self-serving manner.  Swenson and Cabillot are 2/3 of the company’s “Investment Committee,” which invests PDEX’s “surplus capital” (~$4mm as of most recent Q).  ~$1.3mm of this capital was invested in Air T, which Swenson and Cabillot are on the board of (and Swenson is the CEO of).  If this were a larger amount, I’d be more concerned about it.  Something to keep an eye on.
I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

  Endeavour Financial
Endeavour (EDV CN) is a Canadian merchant bank focusing on the natural resource sector.  At its current price of 1.40 per share, the company is trading at 66% of the cash and investments on the balance sheet at 3/31/09 (2.10 per share).  Sources of upside include a successful launch of the company's gold-focused investment fund and/or a recovery in the advisory business.
  ***All figures in CAD***
Cash and Investments
At 3/31, EDV had 115mln of cash on the balance sheet (1.18 per share) invested ST govt treasuries.  The company also had 89mln of investments, invested mainly in publicly traded equities (73.5% of Q3 09 investments, convertible debt (17.8%) and warrants (8.7%).  According to mgmt, more than 50% of the portfolio at 3/31 was held in 4 stocks, Pacific Rubiales (PRE CN), Gold Wheaton (GLW CN), Rusoro Mining (RML CN equity) and Baja Mining Corp (BAJ CN).  Based on the performance of these 4 known securities and using the TSX Venture Index as a proxy for the rest of the portfolio, it is likely that the current value of the investment portfolio is materially above the 89mln reported at 3/31.  However, assuming the 3/31 value, EDV has 2.10 of cash and investments per share.
  Investment Fund
EDV is currently trying to raise a $500mln (400mln external, 100mln EDV cash) to create a fund to invest in junior gold companies and combine them into an intermediate producer.  In doing this, the company hopes to benefit from a valuation rerating by creating a gold producer of significant size as well as have upside from any increases in the gold price.  The exact details of this fund are still being worked out but EDV expects to receive management and performance fees on the outside capital and invest for a multi-year period.  If this fund is successful, the upside for EDV shareholders could be material through both the appreciation of EDV's investment as well as cashflow from the fees over the life of the fund.  As the specific details of the fund remain unknown, it is difficult to quantify this impact accurately but I think it is relatively apparent there could be significant upside if the fund is successful.
Advisory Business
EDV is a leading merchant bank for natural resource companies.  The advisory business has been struggling so far this year due to a dearth of natural resources deals in the past 3 quarters.  I estimate that the business has burned about 4-5mln of cash through the first 3 qtrs of FY 09.  However, if natural resource transactions resume this business could produce significant positive cash flow (+33mln EBITDA in FY 08).  Once again, while it is difficult to ascribe a specific value to EDV's advisory business, this value is likely to be greater than zero. 
Risks
The most obvious risk is that EDV's existing investments collapse and the companys loses most of the money that it invests in the gold fund and as well (perhaps gold prices crater).  However, I think the current discount to cash and investments helps mitigate this risk somewhat. For example, if EDV loses 50% of the cash that it invests in the fund and its existing investment portfolio declines 50% from now, then the company would have adjusted cash and investments of 1.05 per share which is 25% below the current share price and assumes 0 value for the advisory business.  As far as risks to the upside, I would also note that EDV has 32.5mln warrants outstanding with a 2.50 strike price, the dilution from which should be considered when thinking about upside scenarios. 
Conclusion
Overall, if EDV is successful in raising the fund, then you have 1.39 per share of remaining cash and investments and a free look on the success of the gold-focused fund and any potential recovery of the advisory business.  If the company is not successful in raising the fund, then you have a company trading at a significant discount to cash and investments which is not burning material cash with an advisory business that could benefit from an upswing in resource transactions.  Thus, I believe that while it difficult to pin exact values on the company, EDV appears to be a situation with limited downside and significant upside potential.

  Thesis
  Friedman Industries (FRD) is a quiet, thinly-traded microcap (36 million) steel processer that is a slam-dunk play on already-expanding oil and natural gas pipelines.  FRD currently trades around a conservative liquidation value and has the potential for a capital-appreciation return of between 20% - 65% in the near term (under 1 year) with potential to return over 100% in the long term (1 year plus), plus dividends received in between.
  The thesis is very simple:  FRD operates an essential service for US Steel that was paused in 2009 because US Steel temporarily idled a nearby facility.  That facility is now back online and orders have resumed at near previous paces, but the stock price has not responded accordingly.  We believe that the market has not yet priced a) the nature and b) the value of this relationship into the stock, which we think will change as the company continues to report higher sales volume quarter-over-quarter in its Tubular segment.  In addition, FRD now trades around a conservative estimation of liquidation value (net-net) which limits downside risk.  So far, we have one quarter of confirmation.  We expect to get another around the mid-August Q2 10-Q release.
  We argue that a mispricing has occurred here due mainly to the size of the company.  The company 1) has no analysts following 2) has hardly any institutional interest 3) doesn't hold earnings calls and 4) doesn't release 8-ks announcing its earnings and providing guidance.  The only information gleaned about the company is that reported in 10-Qs and 10-Ks four times a year (and what we can guess from dividend payouts).
  Company Details
  The FRD story is pretty straightforward.  The company has existed for 45 years as a family-owned/operated corporation doing pretty much the same thing - processing hot-rolled coils into sheet and plate (Coil Segment) and cutting and finishing tubular steel goods (Tubular Segment), both of which it sells wholesale.  FRD owns three factories - hot-rolled processors in Hickman, Arkansas and Decatur, Alabama and a Tubular Goods processor in Lone Star, Texas.  The business as a whole is a good one and run impeccably well, as witnessed by the length of time in operations.  The company has been profitable every year of record (since 1990) and likewise has paid a dividend every quarter, corresponding to profitability. 
  FRD also has a sort-of-hidden third business, which is the focus of our report.  From the most recent 10-k: ""In recent years, the Company has manufactured and sold substantially all of its line and oil country pipe to US Steel Tubular Products .... Historically, USS has been our primary supplier of tubular products."" These quotes suggest that FRD buys (a type of) pipe from US Steel, processes it, and sells it back for a profit.  This is a servicing business, and one with little competition, substitutes, or threats of new entrants.  This is not a commodity business as the market / company reports could lead one to believe.
  In other words, this third business - and 30% of the company's revenues in FYE 2009 - is FRD's relationship with US Steel (which is accounted for in the Tubular segment).  FRD can do this because its plants are a) capable (obviously) and b) very close to the US Steel facilities, providing US Steel with a lower cost alternative than building the plant itself or purchasing the pipe from another supplier farther away.  Most significantly, it is likely that the low-cost nature of this relationship is vital to the relative cost position and / or quality of the US Steel product, and it is precisely the resumption of this relationship that we think the market has a) discounted completely or b) not yet recognized.

  Clearly we can see a recovery in the Tubular segment from the FY 2010 lows and a corresponding recovery in revenues.  We attribute this 10,000 ton bump Q-to-Q entirely to the resumption of the relationship with US Steel.  As a reminder, FRD reported that the plant was idled in February 2009 and reopened in February 2010. 
  Downside protection
  The company's balance sheet is rock-solid, leaning towards cash-heavy.  The company has $2.91 per share in gross cash and $1.64 per share in cash less liabilities.  Our liquidation analysis is as follows:

        And, since the company books inventory at the lower of cost or market, it is possible that the market value of the inventory is higher than book value, but not the other way around.  In addition, this liquidation value ascribes hardly any value to the property under liquidation.  Ultimately, this suggests that our liquidation value is conservative.
  Projections and Valuation
  We project three cases:
  1) A base case, where Q4/2010A is a run-rate for the year. In this scenario, we project 92 million in sales and 0.64 in earnings per share. This implies an EV/sales value of 0.18 and a PE ex- gross cash of 3.88.
  2) A worst case, where revenue dips back to near FYE 2010 values. In this case, we see about 70 million in sales and 0.40 in earnings per share. This implies an EV/sales value of 0.24 and a PE ex-gross cash of 11.84
  3) A best case, where the Tubular segment sales return to FYE 2008/2009 levels. In this case, we see about 120 million in sales and 0.80 in earnings per share. This implies an EV/sales value of 0.14 and a PE ex-gross cash of 3.11.
  In our valuation, we average the price according to the historical average PE ex-cash (8) (plus gross cash) and historical average EV/sales (.27) to each of these scenarios and weight them accordingly.
  1) Base case : 7.33
2) Worst case: 5.14 (note - this is significantly lower than liquidation value)
3) Best case : 8.50
  In an equal weighted scenario, this stock should trade at about $7 per share, providing 20% upside to the share price.  In an overweight positive scenario (50% best, 50% base, 0% worst), the stock should trade at about $8 per share today.  At the current share price of 5.4, it seems that the market expects a significantly higher percentage chance of the worst case scenario than we do, especially considering what we know about nature of the relationship with US Steel (and its previous resumption).
  In addition, US Steel recently reported excellent results and positive guidance for their Tubular segment, mostly due to strong demand and a continuing decrease in supply from Chinese steel manufacturers (got to love protectionist trade rulings).  US Steel did suggest that the market will be maturing soon (1 to 2 quarters out), suggesting that there's still a bit of growth before a run rate is appropriate.
  Additional upside
  The stock has additional upside in two things:  1) dividend payments and 2) general economic recovery. 
  1) As previously noted the company has paid out a dividend every quarter for the entirety of its publicly traded history (and longer, according to the company). Currently the company is paying an annualized 0.16 per share, but we expect that to double in the near term and return to more historical numbers. At 0.32 per share, the company would yield an additional 5.9% on top of the expected capital gains. We also think that increases to the dividend will attract investors and provided a catalyst for the stock.
  2) Should general economic conditions recover (and with them, end-user demand for the non-US Steel businesses) we think the stock could reach as high as 10 per share based on improved volumes over our best-case analysis.
  3) Huge swings in commodity pricing can become favorable. This happened in the first three quarters of FY 2009, and the company made record profits and, I might add, wisely paid down debt in the fat years to prepare for the lean years. Another testament to wise management perhaps?
  Risks to the investment
  1) Huge swings in commodity prices can hurt profitability. Because FRD buys and sells relatively standardized products, it is at the mercy of supply and demand for these products. However, the prices of both of these products are, for the most part, highly correlated, so that when input costs go up, (hot-rolled coil or unfinished tubes), output prices increase in a similar fashion. In addition, some of this risk is mitigated by the cost advantage FRD possesses in its factory locations.
  2) A double-dip recession could reduce demand in total, especially for future energy consumption. This could have the effect of lowering CAPEX from oil and gas majors, reducing end user demand for pipes. This could lead to a potential re-shut down of the US Steel plant that resumed in February. We don't think this is likely considering our conversation with the US Steel Investor Relations manager and his confidence in this particular market. However, as previously stated, we think that the liquidation value provides significant downside protection to the stock.
  3) Additional supply is coming online/being imported (at fair prices) in the Tubular market, which may take market share away from US Steel. We think the effect of this is minimal because US Steel ought to be able to successfully defend their share (supply is not overwhelming, US Steel has great customer relationships, quality of product is better). Nevertheless, this could limit upside somewhat in the long term.

Overview:
We believe AerCap Holdings NV (NYSE: AER) represents a compelling long investment over the next 24 months with upside catalysts driven by their transformative acquisition of competitor ILFC from AIG announced in late 2013. We see limited downside from the current stock price with the stock currently trading at ~1.2x PF Book Value on the combined business (expected close in mid Q2 2014) which is set to earn 15-17% ROEs and continue to grow organically.
Over time we have found many examples where a transformative and highly accretive M&A transaction is not properly discounted by the market leading to a time-arbitrage opportunity. We believe these opportunities exist because: (i) management is not inclined to set the bar high for these already attractive deals, (ii) the sell-side is not incented to look out 2+ years in a transformative acquisition or (iii) investors are unwilling to wait for the longer dated benefits of the acquisition.
We believe AerCap (AER) represents just such an opportunity with EPS power of  ~$5.50 by 2016 for patient investors.
Business Overview:
AerCap operates in an easy to understand and easy to model business, aircraft leasing. Prior to the announced transaction, the three largest players in the global aircraft leasing industry were: (i) GE Aircraft Leasing (GECAS) with 1,670 aircraft, (ii) ILFC (owned by AIG) with 1,002 aircraft and (iii) AerCap (AER) with 327 aircraft. The AER acquisition of ILFC will create the second largest player with similar scale to GECAS.
The business model is fairly simple with aircraft leasing companies purchasing planes from Airbus / Boeing directly or engaging in sale-leaseback transaction with global airlines on existing fleet assets. The lessors receive monthly rent with the major cost items being depreciation, SG&A overhead and financing costs. AER / ILFC have 80% of their expected lease revenues for the next three years already contracted showing the long term nature of these contracts.
We believe the aircraft leasing industry has positive industry fundamentals driven by secular growth in air travel globally and aircraft leasing gaining share as a percentage of aircraft purchased.
Global air travel is growing 3-4% with faster growth coming from emerging markets. AerCap has shown a focus on newer aircraft and emerging markets with APAC, Latin America and Africa / Middle East representing >40% of lease revenues prior to the ILFC transaction.
Aircraft lessors have also grown their share of aircraft finance (vs. airlines and other financing sources). According to Ascend Fleets Database, lessors now account for ~40% aircraft finance today up from ~25% 15 years ago. We expect this trend to continue driven in part by new sale-leaseback transactions.
The Opportunity:
We believe the AER / ILFC transaction will be even better than management is leading investors to believe leading to >$5 per share in EPS power today, growing organically from there.
Here is how we get there:
AER pre-tax profits in 2013 are ~$330 million
ILFC pre-tax profits in 2013 are ~$540 million
From there we have several purchase accounting adjustments:
ILFC write-down on their assets which should reduce Depreciation by $450M per year
ILFC cost of debt is ~6.5% vs. AER at ~4% so there will be an accounting debt markup that will reduce interest expense by ~$200M per year. Note this implies a ~100 bps adjustment to ILFC cost of debt which we think could be a source of upside as the ILFC debt is refinanced lower
Certain ILFC leases are at higher rates than market today which will create a lease asset that will be amortized by ~$200M per year
The net impact of these purchase accounting adjustments = +$450M to pre-tax profits per year
AER will also change the ILFC accounting for maintenance expenditures to conform with AER assumptions leading to a ~$100M reduction in ILFC PBT per year
AER has guided to $2B of new acquisition debt which believe will be lower due to the cash flow generated by ILFC from announcement to closing. Based on conversations with management this amount could be as low as $1B but we assume $1.5B at a cost of 5% or $75M per year
Management has guided to $100M per year in annual synergies
These adjustments lead us to 2013 run-rate PBT of $1,245 million
Management has guided to >$3B of operating cash flow per year which on an asset base of $40B could support mid-single digit growth in flight equipment / rental income per year. For conservatism, we forecast a modest 3% organic growth in pre-tax profits from 2014 to 2016
This gets us to 2016 Pre-Tax profits of  $1,320
AER currently pays an ~8% blended tax rate between The Netherlands and Ireland. ILFC planes will be redomiciled to Ireland over the course of 2014 and 2015. This will result in a blended tax rate of roughly 12% for AER in total by 2016
A 12% blended tax rate would get us to $1,160 of Net Income in 2016
FD Shares of 212.56M (115M AER shares today + 97.56 issued for ILFC transaction)
This gets us to 2016 EPS power of $5.50
We would also note that management guided to a 5.5 debt-to-equity ratio when the transaction was announced and committed to de-lever to 4.0 within 24 months. This was based on a $22-23 stock price prior to announcement and with the stock now at ~$35, the transaction would be roughly 5.0 debt-to-equity improving the leverage optics out of the gate.
We also believe management has somewhat of an incentive to “keep the stock price down” prior to close because the higher the stock price, the larger the accounting purchase price which could lead to higher depreciation or higher goodwill at close. This could be the reason that management is guiding to Run-Rate EPS of “$4.00+” vs. our expectation of  >$5.00.
Finally, we see longer term upside as AER is able to refinance ILFC’s debt to a lower rate. While we are getting some benefit of that (roughly ~100 bps) in the purchase accounting adjustments, we think there could be further savings in the future as the business is integrated and modestly de-levers. Another 50 bps savings on ILFC debt would equate to ~$0.45 of incremental EPS power.
Valuation / Price Target
AerCap, pro forma for ILFC will have approximately $6B of equity and generate $1B+ of run-rate net income at close for an ROE of ~17%. We think it would be fair to capitalize AER’s growing EPS at a 10-12x P/E given the favorable growth profile of the business and the solid ROE.
We also believe that AER could garner a higher multiple than it has in years past due to its larger scale and market capitalization (~$7.5B today) relative to the smaller and mid-cap peers in the industry. AER’s larger size could generate more interest from institutional investors and move aircraft leasing businesses toward the mainstream from their current niche, small/mid-cap market.
There are three public comparables that inform our view on valuation: (i) Aircastle (AYR), (ii) Air Lease Corp (AL) and (iii) Fly Leasing (FLY). The comps have market caps of $650M to $3.2B, Cash ROEs of 7-13.5% and 2014 P/Es of 10.6-14.3x (12.3x on average).
As another comparison, United Rentals (URI) is an unrelated leasing business generating ~23% ROEs and trading for 13.2x 2014 EPS estimates today.
If we give AER 11x ~$5.50 in 2016 EPS we get a target price of $60.50 per share, up 70%+ from the current price or a ~30% compounded return over the next two years.
For downside, we expect AER will have nearly $28 per share of book value at closing in Q2. If AER were to trade down to book value we would see ~20% downside from current prices. Given that AER will be generating teens ROEs, growing low single digits organically and will have a $25B order book of new high demand planes from ILFC, we don’t believe AER should trade for book value or below for a sustained period of time.
We view the 70%+ upside over 2 years and 20% downside as a favorable risk / reward in the current environment.
I do not hold a position of employment, directorship, or consultancy with the issuer.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

OVERVIEW:
Rhipe Limited is an aggregator and wholesaler of cloud-enabled software (and more recently, infrastructure - more on that later). In practice, software is consumed by a large number of corporate enterprises who often need help understanding, implementing, and configuring the software they use. This help typically comes from the very large and fragmented universe of IT service providers. As a distributor, Rhipe takes software from giant multinational vendors like Microsoft, VMWare, and Citrix and makes it available to IT service providers who then set it up for their end customers. This model allows companies like Microsoft the ability to work with 10-20 key partners, as opposed to hundreds of thousands of IT service providers, or millions of corporate enterprises. Vendors count on wholesalers like Rhipe to build their sales channel, educate and train the channel, and provide customer service and billing (95% of Microsoft's revenue comes from Channel Partners). All of the software that Rhipe distributes / licenses is cloud based and is paid for on a monthly subscription basis or pay-per-consumption. In other words, nearly all of Rhipe's revenues are recurring on a monthly basis. 
  HISTORY:
NewLease was established in 2003 by Doug Tutus and Dawn Edmonds with the vision of becoming the next generation software channel. “Born in the Cloud”, NewLease’s specialization in subscription licensing was underpinned by the rise of cloud computing and offered customers increased flexibility and lower initial capital outlay than traditional models of software consumption (perpetual license agreements + hardware investment). On December 3, 2013 NewLease agreed to be acquired (Doug would retain 40% ownership and Dawn 5%). Mike Hill led the transaction which involved taking the company public via a controlled shell company, FRR Corporation. Leading up to its acquisition NewLease had $51m AUD in revenue and had grown revenue at a 47% CAGR over the prior 5 years. In February of 2014, Doug Tutus tragically and unexpectedly died on a business trip to Canada. Over the next 5 months, Dawn Edmonds served as interim CEO, before Dominic O’Hanlon was appointed as the new CEO on July 30 2014. Dominic has served in prior roles as Chief Strategy Officer for MYOB (sold to Bain Capital in 2011 for $1.2B), Senior Vice President of Oracle Corporation, and President and CEO of Haley Limited (sold to Oracle in 2009). Whilst at MYOB, Dominic built an instrumental partnership with Microsoft in order to deploy MYOB AccountRight Live on Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform. In August of 2014, the company changed its name to Rhipe Limited. 
  BUSINESS:
Rhipe Limited partners with 2,500+ resellers to drive cloud based licensing across the Asia Pacific region. Its key vendors include Microsoft, VMWare, RedHat, Citirix, TrendMicro, Veeam, Zimbra, Datacore, and Symantec. As of June 2018, 96% of Rhipe’s revenue consisted of cloud licensing while the remaining 4% consisted of cloud solutions (support people and professional services to help service providers with technical needs). Additionally, 70% of Rhipe’s revenue came from Australia and New Zealand while 30% came from South East Asia. 
  It is easiest to think about Rhipe’s licensing business in 3 different segments: (1) Microsoft SPLA Licensing, (2) Microsoft CSP Licensing, and (3) Other Licensing. Microsoft currently accounts for 72% of revenue and is likely to continue to become and even bigger portion of Rhipe’s business. The Microsoft Service Provider License Agreement (SPLA) provides the license rights to host specific Microsoft Products. With SPLA, IT Service Providers can license eligible Microsoft products through Rhipe on a monthly basis to provide software services and applications to end users. The key item to not here is that SPLA licensing is for software that is NOT hosted by Microsoft.  Up until 2016 Microsoft SPLA Licensing and Licensing from other vendors accounted for all of Rhipe’s revenue. 
  CSP LISCENSING:
The core of my investment thesis centers on Rhipe's key position as a Microsoft Cloud Solutions Provider, or CSP. The Microsoft CSP program was launched in 2015 and is Microsoft's way to distribute Office 365, Enterprise Mobility + Security, Windows 10, Microsoft Dynamics 365 and more. Importantly, the CSP program is for licensing software that IS hosted by Microsoft. Rhipe is one of only 11 Globally Managed CSP Licensing Partners, and currently has the #1 position and 40% market share of the CSP Indirect model in the APAC ex-Japan region. There is an enormous amount of compute shifting to Public Cloud with a limited number of dominant global providers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. And as a CSP Distributor, Rhipe will be one of the few global partners that is acting as the enabler of this structural transition for Microsoft in the APAC ex-Japan region. There are two models within the Microsoft CSP Program, (1) The Direct Model, and (2) The Two-Tier or Indirect Model. According to Microsoft, the vast majority of its partner channel will be serviced within the two tier model, and while Rhipe has the ability to operate under the Direct Model, their DNA is “Channel First” and driving value for their reseller partners. 
    In 2017, Rhipe commissioned a study by Acuitas Consulting to estimate the size of the Microsoft CSP Indirect opportunity in the APAC region and needless to say, the results were very encouraging. Here are a few of the key takeaways.
      While currently small compared to total revenue, Rhipe's CSP business is growing at incredible rates (O365 seat count up ~100% in the last 12 months). As of September 10th 2108 Rhipe has 300K O365 seats which generate $39m in annual recurring revenue, compared to a total revenue of $197m AUD. Currently there are 10 Microsoft CSP providers in South East Asia and 8 in Australia. One risk to this business is that IT service providers have the ability to switch Microsoft CSP Wholesalers. For instance they could switch from Rhipe to Ingram Micro, and Rhipe would then lose the recurring revenue from the end consumer that the specific service provider represents. However, it is my understanding that the customer churn is incredibly low. There are no technical barriers to exit, but Rhipe's job is to add value to their IT service provider customers by helping them grow their business and by making them look good in front of their end users. End customer lead generation, Marketing as a Service, technical enablement and training, tech nights and workshops, 24/7 customer support and service, and Rhipe's first class Platform for Recurring Subscription Management (PRISM) are a few of the key elements that drive customer loyalty and retention. Rhipe generally targets small IT service providers that don't have their own in-house software for managing and provisioning accounts, and who also get a lot of benefit from the technical training a support provided by Rhipe. In addition to this, most reseller have only hundreds or thousands of users, which makes cost only one factor when considering their CSP wholesaler. Finally, Rhipe's customer base of IT Service Providers is massively fragmented and with every passing month it continues to become more diverse (increase of signed CPS tier-2 resellers by 50% over the past 12 months).
  While the CSP program will inevitably have some negative impact on the performance of Rhipe's traditional SPLA business (currently ~57% of revenue), I believe the SPLA business will continue to grow albeit at slower rates as many end users seek a hybrid cloud solution compared to a pure public cloud solution. In fact in the most recent quarterly conference call, management noted that the legacy SPLA business grew 12% in aggregate and 42% in South East Asia for the fiscal year and they see no reason for it to stop. Here are the rough numbers based on the information given in the annual report, call transcripts, and IR presentation. 
      CSP LISCENSING – PART 2:
I believe Rhipe would still be a compelling opportunity if software distribution through the CSP program was the only element fueling their growth. However, there’s an even larger unappreciated opportunity, distribution of Infrastructure-as-a-Service. Azure distribution through the Microsoft CSP Program began in earnest two years after the distribution of O365. As of September 2018 Rhipe had $9m AUD in annual recurring revenue from Azure, a 300% increase from June of 2107. In 2017, IaaS represented 17% of public cloud revenue but is forecasted to grow at faster rates that SaaS over the next 5 years. According to forecasts by Gartner, global IaaS spend is forecast to double over the next 3 years reaching $80+ billion. 
  I believe over time distribution of IaaS will become an even bigger business for Rhipe than SaaS. Cloud migration is a difficult process, and Rhipe’s technical expertise and focus on adding value to their IT Service Provider network gives them a big advantage here. In addition, Microsoft has exceled in the SaaS space with O365 but on IaaS they have a lot of work to do to catch up with AWS.  They are making a concerted effort now to drive Azure growth in the form of higher margins for their CSP partners and promotional offers to end users. They also have continued to make their traditional on premise business more expensive, further encouraging customers to move to the cloud. 
    Finally, Rhipe can continue to expand its business by being awarded new geographies by Microsoft. Last year they were awarded South Korea, and this Year New Zealand. The most logical next geography would be Japan, which would be an enormous market and drastically increase the potential end customer base for Rhipe. 
  PRISM PORTAL:
A key element to Rhipe’s intellectual property is their subscription management platform called PRISM. Through PRISM Rhipe’s 2,500+ reseller partners can, provision, bill, and manage the software consumed by their end clients all from a single platform. 
    In addition, while many CSP cloud distributors send their partners one bill for each customer tenant created, Rhipe offers its partners a single invoice each month regardless of the number they have. This dramatically simplifies the user experience for the IT Service Providers driving further adoption of the PRISM platform.
  VALUATION:
If Rhipe’s legacy business continues to grow at even modest rates, and the CSP business continues to grow at half the present rate, there is tremendous upside potential from the operating leverage in the business. Nearly all of Rhipe’s costs ex vendor payments are personnel and investments in new teams to open up new regions (e.g. South Korea in FY 2018). Rhipe has shown that they can be diligent on cost control and expect to see operating leverage play out as the business continues to grow and investments in new geographies bear fruit. 
    As an example, from FY 2015 through FY 2017 total expenses increased $4.5m AUD while revenues increased $53m AUD and gross profit increased $8.1m AUD. Today Rhipe has 138m shares outstanding on a diluted basis and $23m AUD in cash and zero debt. Here is a simplified model of what the economics could conservatively look like over the next three years. 
    Under the assumptions above (which I believe are still on the conservative side), if Rhipe’s share price remains unchanged it will be trading at sub 10x EV to Free Cash Flow within the next 2-3 years growing underlying cash flow at 35%+ YoY with 100% recurring revenues.  It’s hard to know exactly what the business is worth, but reaching a 10% free cash flow yield in 2 years for a business growing north of 30% seems obviously mispriced to me. Depending on one’s assumptions for the runway of growth ahead for O365 and Azure, this business could be many multiples the size of today in 10 years’ time. I believe a fair price range would be $2.0 AUD to $2.6 AUD per share or a 70% to 125% premium to today’s trading range. A 125% premium would result in the business trading at 10x EV to FCF  in 6 years’ time and a 70% premium would result in the business trading at a 10x EV to FCF in 4 years’ time. 
  RISKS:
Customers switch away from Rhipe in favor of another CSP 2-Tier Distributor. 
I believe this risk is mitigated by the fact that Rhipe focuses on adding value to their reseller partners, and as they grow, their scale will allow them to do even more for their partners in a cost effective manner. Additionally, this is an enormous end market. There is plenty of room for Rhipe, Ingram Micro, and a few others to all do well together.
Competitor poach Rhipe’s employees. 
This is very possible. Ingram Micro is the other player with significant scale that is very active in the APAC region, but their focus is not on small IT service providers. At the end of the day, it will be very important for Rhipe to keep their employees happy and motivated. 
Microsoft controls product pricing. Therefore when they lower prices of Azure and O365, it impacts Rhipe’s top line. 
Microsoft generates 95% of their revenue through their partner channel. It is in their best interest to act in a way that is mutually beneficial. For instance many of their current initiatives are focused on driving growth in the CSP program by offering attractive margins to distributors like Rhipe and promotions to end users.  
Global Trend Shift back toward on premise compute. 
It is hard to imagine this occurring, but it is a tail risk.
  I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

Overview
Vista Outdoor is both a CEO change story and a cycle-recovery story.  This ammunition and outdoor products company was written up on VIC back in February.  Since then, the stock is down 30%, bringing the cumulative peak-to-current decline to 70%.  The empire-building CEO who led its poorly executed acquisition-strategy has been replaced by an executive with experience building consumer products brands (which former CEO lacked) and 9 years as a Managing Director of a multi-billion private equity firm.  Just one month into job, Vista’s new CEO slashed expectations (timely move - 2/3rds of his equity package hasn’t been priced), announced plans to divest 3 non-core brands, and set the stage for a meaningful SG&A-reduction program. 
Meanwhile, the ammunition cycle is 12 months into the downturn, channel inventories are normalizing, firearm and ammunition demand haven’t collapsed to the extent that bears expected, the November 2016 Presidential election has just been lapped and continued Republican control of Executive and Congress looks less certain. 
Today, Vista is valued at $1.85 billion (versus $4.2bn at peak) and at just 80% of sales, well-below private market multiples for well-invested consumer product brands and even further below the $2.3bn it paid for the acquisitions Vista made just since 2013 (note – the Ammunition business Vista/ATK owned prior to investing this $2.3 billion averaged $110mn in ebita in the 4 years ending March 2013).  On an earnings basis, Vista trades at 9.8x trough ebitda and 14x ebita, with the opportunity to double margins as SG&A is rightsized and sales recover cyclically over the next two years.
Detail
Vista was the subject of a good writeup by lzmos in February 2017, which I recommend reading.  That report provides a good overview of the business and the factors that caused the stock to decline from a peak of $50/share in mid-2016 to $21/share in early 2017 (vs $14 today). 
In brief, Vista is a consumer products company that was spun out of Orbital ATK in 2015 with an acquisition strategy designed to take what had been a legacy ammunition company and diversify it into the broader outdoor products industry.  The former CEO of ATK led the spin and the acquisition strategy, spending $2.3bn between 2013 and 2016 on diversifying acquisitions of outdoor product brands.  In hindsight, Vista not only overpaid for these businesses, but they did a terrible job integrating them, leading to significant management turnover at the acquired businesses and market share loss.  Management compounded its poor capital allocation decisions by spending $300mn on share repurchases in 2015 and 2016 despite significant evidence that the business was deteriorating. 
In November 2016, the election of Donald Trump as President significantly exposed Vista’s missteps, as it precipitated a cyclical decline in ammunition demand and highlighted the significant inventory build that had occurred pre-election at both the retail and wholesale levels and by the consumer him/herself. 
Since then, a substantial inventory de-stocking has occurred, leading to meaningful declines in Vista’s volumes, pricing and gross margins.  Consensus ebita (excluding Vista’s substantial amortization expense) for its fiscal year ending March 2018 is just $133mn, down 55% from what Vista earned in fiscal 2016.  The consensus ebita margin of 5.9% is half the 12.0% earned on average between 2010 and 2016.
Ultimately, in July, CEO Mark DeYoung was deposed as CEO.  Three months later, Vista announced the appointment of Chris Metz as CEO (https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vista-outdoor-names-christopher-t-metz-as-chief-executive-officer-300532090.html). 
Chris spent 13 years at Black & Decker, including serving as President of the Hardware and Home Improvement Group from 1999 to 2005.  After leaving Black & Decker, he spent 9 years as an MD at Sun Capital, a multi-billion private equity firm.  From 2014-2017, Chris served as the CEO of snowmobile maker Arctic Cat.  In fair disclosure, Artic Cat was not a successful stock during Chris’ tenure.  Chris will tell you that he inherited a host of problems when he took the role and that ultimately the value maximizing strategy was to sell the business to Textron.  Given this blemish, it is important that you do your own work on whether Chris is the change agent that Vista needs.
Thesis
Our investment thesis has the following components.
Ammo cycle bottoming
CEO Change - New CEO is much more equipped to manage this portfolio.
Expectations reduced to much more reasonable levels.
Balance sheet risks overstate
Tax-reform – a freebie.
Ammo Demand
We believe the ammunition cycle is bottoming.  While adjusted NICs checks – a concurrent indicator of firearm demand and a reasonable proxy for underlying ammunition demand – are down 10% ytd, demand has held in much better than the bears expected.  For those without background in this sector, many predicted that the Republican sweep in the 2016 elections would cause firearm demand to collapse back to pre-Obama administration levels.  This has not happened, however, as the main underlying drivers of firearm demand remain intact (rising interest in target shooting, safety concerns, 2nd Amendment believers).  Timing-wise, with the November 2016 election moving into the 12 month+ rear view mirror, we expect that NICs checks will begin stabilizing starting in December, which we believe would do a lot for investor sentiment.
Moreover, we believe that much of the inventory build that occurred leading up to the election has been worked off.  Vista has transparency into inventory and point-of-sale data from its retailer and wholesaler customers.  After several quarters of lamenting excess product inventories that have led to orders below retail levels and substantial price competition (at the retail, wholesale and OEM levels), Vista recently stated that big-box inventories have returned to normal and that wholesaler inventories are slightly above normal.  Once inventories normalize (which management expects to occur by the end of the March quarter), purchases can begin to reflect underlying demand, which we expect will restore revenue growth. Returning to revenue growth will have an outsized impact on margins as VSTO has been operating at 80% capacity utilization. Additional volume should benefit gross profit margins as incremental margins have typically been in the ~35% range.
CEO Change
We believe the replacement of Mark DeYoung with Chris Metz is a clear upgrade and will be the catalyst for substantially improved capital allocation and execution.  We believed that Mark lacked the consumer products expertise to run the acquired Outdoor Products brands.  Ammunition is not a typical branded business, with substantially less emphasis on marketing and innovation than usually seen in consumer products businesses.  Conversely, Chris brings a long background in the consumer products industry – from Black & Decker, his time at Sun Capital and Arctic Cat.  This should be a significant upgrade.  Moreover, we believe that Chris brings a fresh set of eyes to management’s prior decisions, as evidenced by his quick decision to sell the Bolle, Serengeti and Cebe brands, and management’s hints that an SG&A reduction would soon be forthcoming (note – SG&A, excl. amortization, is running at 15.8% this calendar year, 200bps above management’s estimate of a more reasonable level).
Expectations reduced to much more reasonable levels
Consensus revenue expectations for fiscal 2019 (March) assume mid-single-revenue growth versus f’18 and 7.2% ebita margins (vs 5.9% in f’18).  Given that sales, gross margins and pricing have been substantially impacted in f’18 by lower capacity utilization and fixed cost absorption and substantial discounting, we believe there is a lot of room for margin to recover as/when the destocking phase ends.  Note that ebita margins averaged 12% over the 2010-16 period, double this year’s expected result.
Balance sheet risks overstated
We believe the current valuation -- 80% of sales for a portfolio of consumer products brands with pretty good competitive positions – reflects substantial investor concern regarding Vista’s balance sheet.  Vista’s leverage ratio is expected to approach its 4.75x covenant as earnings deteriorate in the second half of this fiscal year and its leverage covenant steps down to 4.25x from March 2019. 
Nevertheless, we believe that investor concerns are overstated as we expect Vista’s banks will provide it with needed covenant relief rather than forcing a viable branded business into raising equity at the bottom of the cycle (note – the banks already provided Vista with such covenant relief this cycle).  Moreover, Vista recently announced the sale of its sports protection brands. Based on industry comps (10x ebitda, 1x sales), this would reduce leverage by 0.25x.
Additionally, VSTO has substantial inventories and accounts receivables that it is working to turn into cash over the next few quarters. The company completed another round of layoffs in October to further slow production, which is negatively impacting margins, but benefiting free cash flow. Based on our expected sales trajectory, we expect working capital to boost free cash flow by $70-100mn over the next six quarters with further opportunity to lower inventories if sales worsen. On top of this, we expect a substantial cost reduction program to be announced next quarter.
Tax-reform – a freebie
Lastly, while we would not rely on tax reform to justify an investment, were there to be a reduction in the US corporate tax rate along the lines of what is currently being proposed, Vista’s earnings would increase by 15% and improve cash generation, benefitting the company’s leverage ratio through greater cash generation.
Price targets
Base Case: By FY2020, we believe sales will recover to $2.3bn (which assumes the $130mn sale of prescription eyewear assets, $2.43bn pro forma vs. $2.25bn midpoint of FY2018 guidance) and EBITA margins will recover to 8.5% vs. historical margins of 12%+ from 2010-2016 through a combination of cost rationalization, implementation of the announced ammunition price increases, fixed cost absorption in facilities, and softening of promotional activity in outdoor products.
Our base case price target of $25 (80% upside) is based on 11x FY2020 EBITA of $195mn with the equity value benefiting from $320mn in cash generated over the next six quarters: $130mn from the sale of prescription eyewear assets, and $190mn in free cash flow.
Downside: VSTO is clearly heavily leveraged. We don’t believe the company is headed for bankruptcy and that by selling the prescription eyewear brands for $130mn+ and generating the 100mn+ of FCF over the next two quarters, bankruptcy risk will be largely taken off the table. Additionally, the company has more receivables and inventory than net debt, so we believe covenant extension is a feasible, albeit expensive, option if the trajectory worsens.
With that in mind, our downside target price is $11, which assumes sales continue to fall to $2bn in FY2020. In this downside scenario, the company is unable to improve margins significantly, generating only a 6.6% EBITA margin (vs. 5.9% in FY2018), benefiting from reduced SG&A expenses offset by demand continuing to fall in ammunition and a continued decline in the outdoor products business. The equity benefits from working capital reduction driving similar FCF in FY2019 as FY2018 and the $130mn sale of the prescription eyewear business, generating over $350mn+ of cash in total over the next six quarters.
Risks
Channel disruption:  E-commerce is clearly negatively impacting outdoor products retailers – all one needs to do is look at the financials of Dick’s, Gander Mountain (since liquidated), The Sports Authority (since liquidated), Hibbert or Academy. It is no small task to navigate the disruption that e-commerce is placing on bricks and mortar retailers, including developing a successful go-to-market approach in an omni-channel world. Channel disruption could cause more impairment charges in the future. Problems in outdoor products brands more structural than we imagine.  While the brands that Vista acquired were generally strong ones (Camelback, Giro, Bell, etc), there has been a lot of management turnover in these businesses and their capabilities will need to be assessed and, in many cases, rebuilt by Vista under Metz’s leadership.
Additional channel disruption or execution challenges could cause more impairment charges in the future. Vista took impairment charges in the hunting and shooting accessories and sports protection segments during their third quarter release, and estimated that their outdoor recreation and firearms segment were just 5% above book value.
Leverage:  As a result of ebita declining by more than half and meaningful share repurchases on the way down, the business is significantly leveraged. Vista’s leverage ratio stands at nearly 4x ebitda and will continue to step up for the next two quarters.  Through March 2019, the business is working against a covenant of 4.75x ebitda, at which point that number steps down to 4.25x.
Commodity Prices: Copper, Lead, and Zinc prices are the main inputs for ammunition have all increased significantly over the past year. Vista enters forward purchasing agreements which will begin to roll off over the next few quarters, and will have a hand in driving gross margin compression in the back half of FY2018. If Vista cannot raise prices to offset the commodity price pressure as planned, then margins in shooting sports will be lower until commodity prices fall. Copper is the main input has increased significantly over the last year, but is still below levels in 2010-2013 when VSTO earned adequate gross margins in the shooting sports business.
  Customer Bankruptcies: Vista Outdoor has a number of customers that are struggling financially. Gander Mountain was the most recent big box chain to go bankrupt. VSTO suffered a $17mn A/R write down as a result of the bankruptcy. The remaining big box chains seem to be in better financial shape, but there is clearly still risk in further bankruptcies largely from Academy and somewhat in Sportsman’s Warehouse. Beyond big box customers – the wholesale distributors also pose a bankruptcy risk. There have been rumors of these distributors being in a challenging financial shape, largely caused by excess MSR inventory.

Short MKC ($103)
We recommend shorting McCormick & Company (MKC). We acknowledge that banjo1055 wrote this idea ~11 months ago; however, we think the current food industry paradigm shift, coupled with rising interest rates makes this a uniquely interesting time to be short MKC.
Historically, in our view, consumer staples companies have been fantastic investments because of 3 attributes: 1) brands, 2) manufacturing scale, and 3) distribution. We believe that all 3 of these “moats” are reversing and will disrupt what has historically been a great industry. First, we don’t think brands are dead; however, we do believe the cost of building a brand has decreased significantly. This is because smaller companies are able to target customers on digital advertising platforms such as Facebook and Google. Manufacturing scale still exists, but we believe the growth in contract manufacturing is allowing upstart companies to source products more easily. As an example, Dollar Shave Club has become a major shaving brand by sourcing products from a company called Dorco in Korea. Finally, big staples companies have been able to take advantage of the fragmentation among food retailers to maintain fat margins. Now, consumers are more willing to buy food online (endless shelf) and experiment w/ private label products which are gaining shelf space at discount retailers. Overall, time is working against branded consumer staples companies and we think there is a lot of money to be made on the short side.
MKC is a food company with a leading position in spices, seasoning mixes, condiments, and other flavorful products. The company operates in 2 segments: Consumer Segment (~60% of sales) and Flavor Solutions (~40% of sales). The Consumer Segment includes spices, seasonings, condiments & sauces, and recipe mixes. We believe this is a collection of remotely better than average food categories that are predominantly US exposed. This is because, on average, MKC’s Consumer Segment operates in GDP+ categories (rising penetration); however, branded players are losing market share to private label and small brands. For example, searching for “hot sauce” on Amazon will provide you w/ results of several small brands and searching for “oregano” will return Whole Foods’ 365 brand. I would note that WMT is 11% of MKC’s Consumer Segment’s revenue and they are aggressively clamping down on branded food companies and promoting their own private label offerings.
In conversations with investors, bulls believe that MKC deserves to trade at an elevated multiple because of its Flavor Solutions segment. For reference, in this segment, MKC sells flavors to multinational food manufacturers and foodservice companies. For example, MKC sells flavors to Pepsi, which are subsequently used in their potato chips. We agree that MKC is uniquely positioned in this industry and has the widest assortment of flavors; however, most of MKC’s Flavor Solutions customers are the same companies facing secular headwinds across the whole food industry. At some point, Pepsi, which represents 11% of revenue in this segment, will start driving down the price of its suppliers’ products. We don’t know when but we believe its inevitable given the deflation across the value chain.
There are a lot of staples companies that are likely shorts but we find MKC the best risk/reward. During the 2nd half of last year, the company decided to lever up to 5.1x net debt/EBITDA to buy Reckitt Benckiser’s food division. In doing so, the company has geared itself at exactly the wrong time and bought an asset with exactly the wrong characteristics (legacy food brands). We are taken aback that MKC is trading for 21x fwd P/E with 5 turns of debt when more emerging market exposed food companies such as MDLZ trade for <16x fwd P/E with 3 turns of debt. More domestically exposed food companies such as GIS/K/CPB trade for 13-14x fwd P/E though they have made recent acquisitions which have stretched their balance sheets.
Overall, we don’t have an exact price target but believe that MKC should de-rate to 16x fwd P/E given secular headwinds and its levered balance sheet (~$80/shr). What we like about this trade is that time is working for us. Everyday that goes by the industry dynamics get worse for MKC. Hence, we expect our estimate for intrinsic value to only decrease overtime.

Meadow Valley Corporation (MVCO)

Thesis
The value of the MVCO’s subsidiary, its ready-mix business (RMI), is worth more than MVCO as a whole. Following the upcoming public sale of RMI, you essentially will be getting a debt-free construction services business for free plus some likelihood of a positive litigation settlement which would result in MVCO receiving a cash award amounting to up to 40% of the market cap of the company. My target price on MVCO is $11 per share vs the current price of $5.45 (at the time of the submission to VIC). Under more optimistic assumptions the stock is worth $15 per share.

Background
MVCO is a construction-related company that operates two wholly-owned subsidiaries in two distinct businesses. The company operates a heavy civil construction business called Meadow Valley Contractors, which specializes in the construction of infrastructure projects for public sector customers in Nevada, Utah, and Arizona. Meadow Valley Contractors was formed in 1980. MVCO also operates a ready-mix business, called Ready-Mix Inc. (RMI), which provides ready-mix concrete to contractors in the areas of Las Vegas and Phoenix. This business was founded in 1996 and has been growing rapidly since that time.

MVCO went public in 1995 with a market value of $11.6 mil.

For the 9 months ended September 30, 2004, MVCO generated $124 mil of revenue, $317,000 in operating profit and earned $.01 per share on a fully diluted basis of 3.75 mil shares.

Events
MVCO has filed a Form S-1 registration statement for the IPO of its ready-mix business. The deal is likely to be consummated in about two month’s time. The terms are as follows: 1 mil shares will be sold to the public at a price of $12 per share. MVCO will retain 1.5 mil shares such that 2.5 mil RMX shares will be outstanding following the offering. Given the $12 per share targeted IPO price, the equity value of RMI will be $30 mil.

With roughly 3.75 mil fully diluted shares outstanding, MVCO currently has a market capitalization of about $20 mil. As of September 30, 2004, MVCO had $7 mil of cash on hand and $14 mil of debt outstanding. Upon completion of the offering of shares in MVCO’s ready-mix operations (RMI) to the public, the following will occur: (1) RMI will be a publicly traded entity in which MVCO will retain a 60% interest; (2) RMI will assume an estimated $7 mil of debt from MVCO; (3) RMI will receive proceeds from the sale of 1 mil shares; (4) a portion of the proceeds will be used to repay debt owed to MVCO, purchase plant & equipment, and for working capital. My best guess is that RMI will have $10 mil of debt and about $1.3 mil of cash following its IPO. With 2.5 mil shares outstanding, RMI’s market cap will be $30 million.

As part of the transaction, RMI will repay debt as well as assume debt from MVCO, such that proforma, I estimate that MVCO will have about $2 mil of net cash, no debt, and 60% of RMI valued at $18 mil. Keep in mind, at today’s price, with 3.75 mil shares outstanding, MVCO’s equity value is about $20 mil.

Ready-Mix, Inc.
RMI began operations in Q1 1997. Currently, the company operates 2 ready-mix concrete plants in Phoenix and 2 in Las Vegas, with an additional plant located near Moapa, Nevada. The company operates and leases a sand & gravel crushing/screening plant in Moapa which is 50 miles from Las Vegas. RMI also owns and/or operates 125 ready-mix concrete mixing trucks. RMI produces ready-mix concrete by combining the prescribed type of cement, sand, gravel, and crushed stone with water and usually one or more admixtures (chemicals, minerals, fibers). The ready-mix business is driven by the level of construction activity (residential, commercial and public works infrastructure) in the Phoenix and Las Vegas areas. Competitors in the area include: Rinker, Nevada Ready Mix, Silver State Minerals, Cemex, Vulcan and Hanson. (Information on ready-mix concrete can be found from the national Ready-Mix Concrete Association, the industry’s trade association).

For the 9 months ended September 30, 2004, MVCO’s ready-mix business generated $45 mil in revenue, $3.1 mil in operating profit and $1.8 mil of net income according the S-1 filing. On 2.5 mil shares, that works out to be 72 cents per share for the 1st 3 quarters of 2004.

Valuation of RMX
According to RMI’s S-1 filing, under Risk Factors, the company indicates that its “determination of the public offering price of the common stock is arbitrary”. It was determined by “negotiations between [the company] and HD Brous … and might not be indicative of prices that will prevail in the trading market”. I contend that $12 per share is a fair price and could even turn out to be cheap.

The most closely-related public comparable company is U.S. Concrete (RMIX), the largest independent ready-mix operator in the U.S. Currently, RMIX has a market cap of $170 mil. In 2004, the company generated $500 mil in sales along with $40.4 mil in ebitda, $27.7 mil in operating profit, $34.4 mil in cash flow from operations, $26.4 in free cash flow, and 26 cents per share in earnings. At year end, the company had $201 mil in debt and $40 mil of cash. On its Q4 conference call, RMIX gave 2005 guidance for the following: $530-545 mil in revenue, $47-52 mil in ebitda, and $.36-.43 per share in eps. Based on the numbers provided by RMIX management, U.S. Concrete is trading at 8.2x trailing ebitda and roughly 6.1x 2005 ebitda. On an eps basis, RMIX is trading at 14x forward earnings. My estimate (keep in mind MVCO has not yet reported Q4 results) is that RMX will generate $58-60 mil in revenue in 2004 and $4 mil in operating profit, $5.5 mil in ebitda, and about $1.00 per share in eps. Additionally, it will likely generate between $2 mil and $3 mil in free cash flow during 2004. On those estimates, RMI, when it goes public, will be trading at 7.2x 2004 ebitda and 12x trailing earnings. My best estimate at the moment is that RMI could earn $1.12- $1.15 per share in 2005 (this excludes the company’s current plan to add 60 mixing trucks and 1 portable ready-mix plant in 2005). So on that basis, it would be trading at 11x 2005 earnings.

Fundamentals are strong in the ready-mix business given the high level of residential construction, the steady level of public works construction, and the improving level of commercial construction. This is evidenced by the fact that units (cubic yards of ready-mix) shipped by RMX in the 1st 9 months of 2004 increased 27% vs a year ago and pricing increased 5.9%. My outlook for 2005 is for pricing to continue to rise (with an increase at least as high as experienced in 2004), coupled with good volumes (although not as high as in 2004).

Standalone Meadow Valley Contractors
One of the intriguing aspects about MVCO is that the construction services business (CS) is currently losing money. Business is actually improving with the backlog standing at $103.6 mil as of the end of Q3 2004 compared to $71.7 mil a year ago. In fact, the backlog is at its highest level since 1999. However, due to a single contract job in Utah, the entire company is basically breakeven with the CS segment posting a loss ytd in 2004. The money-losing contract in Utah (Gooseberry Project) has been masking an otherwise profitable and healthy business in Arizona and Nevada. The company recognized a loss of $2.6 mil in Q3 and $3.8 mil loss ytd on the Gooseberry Project. This is a project that involves the paving of a 13 mile stretch of road in Utah that was supposed to be completed years ago. Due to cost overruns, an aggressive bid by MVCO, and unanticipated project changes by the state of Utah, MVCO has had to bear the burden of the losses. The company will likely litigate for a refund but for now the company is required to honor its contract and complete the work. The company has stated, although it is difficult to tell from an outsider’s perspective, that it has reserved for any future losses which are expected into 2005. The job is due to be completed by June 2005 and the losses from Gooseberry will then go away. In backing out the losses from this project, I estimate that the company, as a whole, earned 36 cents per share, for the 1st 9 months of 2004. The CS segment would have been breakeven on an operating basis, excluding the Utah losses. Additionally, the company incurred some one-time litigation expenses that further depressed earnings. Excluding those as well, the company would have made a little bit of money. Hopefully, following the completion of Gooseberry later this year, I expect the company to begin to show its true earnings power, which will likely surprise people on the upside.

With any construction company that uses percentage of completion accounting, the analysis of financial statements is tricky and only tells you so much. Important things to understand with construction companies, as with insurance companies, are: (1) the quality & competency of management and (2) the process by which they “bid” for business. In order to ensure that MVCO does not duplicate its problems in Utah, two things recently changed at the company. The first is that, going forward, the company has elected to bid on business only in Arizona and Las Vegas (its two original markets). The company has years of experience dealing with the local state & municipal government agencies in these two states and finds that working with officials there to be much easier. The second change that was made by MVCO is that the Board of Directors has modified the way the company goes through the bidding process. Going forward, the CEO of MVCO is required to sign off on every contract that the company decides to bid upon. This will hopefully act as a check against overly aggressive bids and prevent another Gooseberry from occurring.

Over the last few years, due to losses from the Utah project as well as one other prior project, the company has been constrained in its ability to bid for work. This is because construction companies like MVCO are required to put up surety bonds for the work they do. As the 2003 10-K points out, MVCO’s bonding capacity has been limited since 2001 when it was limited to a total program of $75 mil vs $300 mil in 2000. The good news is that the recent improvement in financial performance at MVCO has led to additional increases in it bonding capacity. The net result should be that the company will be able to expand its business and its top-line (through its ability to bid on a greater universe of contract jobs). If you believe (as I do) that the public works construction market looks to remain strong and/or improve from current levels (as state budget deficits begin to disappear and state governments open their wallets), this increase in bonding capacity at MVCO will allow for a recovery in the top-line and help drive better earnings at the company. The increasing backlog at MVCO is partial evidence for this already occurring.

Valuation of the CS Segment
What can the construction services business earn in a normalized environment? And what is the appropriate value? Assuming the company gets half-way back to its peak level in sales in its construction services segment to about $145 mil (versus in 1999 when it achieved $195 mil in sales) from where it is now and assuming a 1.5% net income margin, then it is not unreasonable to expect the stand alone construction company to earn about $.55 per share. Keep in mind when you look across the construction industry at comparables (FLR, GVA, SGR, JEC), the average 10 year net income margin ranges between 1.7% to 3.3%. You can assign the P/E multiple that you think is appropriate but currently similar construction services companies trade at between 13x and 21x 2005 earnings. On an EV/sales basis, other construction companies trade at about .4x EV/sales. Using that metric, the CS segment within MVCO is worth $11/ share based on 2004 sales of $103 mil.

One final, interesting point to note with MVCO is that they are likely to win litigation settlements from past jobs. It looks like that amount could reach $5-8 mil. So, on top of the $2 mil in net cash that the company will have proforma for the IPO of RMI, I expect the company to potentially bring in another $5 mil or so.

Litigation Issues
As the latest 10-Q points out, “claims for additional contract revenue are recognized only to the extent that contract costs relating to the claims have been incurred and evidence provides a legal basis for the claim.” Currently, the company has $10.5 mil claims outstanding and has recorded $3.5 mil in claims receivable. Two contracts with the state of New Mexico are being litigated. The total claims on these two contracts amount to $8.33 mil. The issues that the company is charging are that there were plan errors & omissions and contract modifications with the projects. The status is pending. Additionally, the company won an arbitration case with Clark County, Nevada over a contract dispute worth $2.1 mil. Since Clark County can appeal the decision, MVCO has not reported the claim on its balance sheet. However, I consider the odds of success in receiving this amount or slightly less to be high.

Putting the Pieces Together
So what is MVCO worth today? I look at this situation such that I am getting an improving construction services business with no debt and some amount of cash on the books (my base case is $4 mil, assuming the $2.1 mil arbitration award is not appealed) for free following the IPO of the RMI business. That is my margin of safety.

Separating out the components, I calculate that RMI is worth $16 per share as a public company. This implies a market cap of $40 mil, of which, MVCO will own 60%. How do I arrive at $16? I am using my 2005 eps estimate of $1.15 and applying a 14x multiple to it. 60% of $40 mil is $24 mil. MVCO’s equity is currently valued at $20 mil. Assuming a recovery in earnings in construction services in 2006 (first full year without Gooseberry), I think the CS segment could earn $.35 per share for MVCO. Applying a 12x multiple (low end of comparables), I get $4.20 per share or $15.75 mil for the equity. Add to that $4 mil of net cash, and the 60% of RMI and you get $15.75 mil + $4 mil + $24 mil = $44 mil. Assuming 3.75 mil shares, that equates to $11.66 per share.

What if things go right for MVCO? Well, the RMI business could do even better than I am assuming. The litigation awards could be 3x what I am assuming. The CS segment could see much better revenue and earnings recovery than I expect. People value the CS segment in-line with the comparables. Under that scenario, the stock is a triple.

Negatives
The following are negatives to be considered when looking at MVCO:

The company is rather aggressive on its granting of options to employees. The last grant amounted to 369,000 shares which is quite high in my opinion.

There is a significant amount of customer concentration at MVCO.

Both businesses within MVCO are dependent on the level of construction in the southwestern U.S.

The company is subject to cost-overruns and incorrect bids in its construction services business. Since the company’s contracts are fixed-price, it is liable for any losses incurred.

Trex
TWP $38.75, http://www.trex.com)

Overview
Trex is the pioneer in the manufacture of decking and railing products from reclaimed wood and plastic. The company was formed in 1996 by four executives from Mobil and brought public in 1999. Annually, Trex purchases about 300 million pounds of used polyethylene (garbage bags, pallet wrap, etc) and an equal amount of recycled wood (sawdust, wood scraps, etc) to process through its manufacturing plants in Winchester, VA (headquarters) and Fernley, NV. The primary advantages of the composite are its longevity, never rots, cracks, splinters, weathers, or needs stain. The partially patented process is easy to install and is used by consumers and contractors throughout the U.S for decking. It is not approved for joist or other supports. Local retail price checks per board (2X6X12) are $20-$23 vs. $5-$6 for treated lumber. Recently the company introduced Trex Accents, their first grained product. In December, the company announced plans to build a third manufacturing plant in Olive Branch, Mississippi. There have been significant insider sales of common stock over the last 6 months (455,000+ shares) with no insider purchases. Insiders own over 50% of the company; three of the four principal shareholders have retired recently.

The Industry*
Over 50 million homes have pressure treated wood structures. It is a $4 billion dollar a year business. About 90% of all decks are made from treated lumber. Ending December 31st, the popular form of lumber known as CCA-treated (chromated copper aesenate) was phased out over the last 22 months due to EPA concerns over arsenic as a toxic ingredient. A new preservative marketed as Preserve by Chemical Specialties Inc. is made with copper and the fungicide quaternary. In short, it's called ACQ-treated lumber. ""It will do the same thing as pressure-treated lumber,"" says Jim Graves, sales and operations manager at Treated Lumber Outlet in Hampton, VA. The negative of ACQ-treated lumber is that it requires galvanized fasteners. Other alternative products are plastic lumber, cedar, and several other expensive imported woods.

Operating Results
Trex’s revenues in 2000 and 2001 were both about $117 million while jumping to $167million in 2002. Revenues are expected to finish at $192 million for the trailing twelve months. For 2004, analysts are expecting $250 million in revenues, up 30%!

Operating earnings are $20.3 million or $1.38 in EPS for the trailing twelve months (ttm). There are 14.7 million shares outstanding with a market cap of $565.7 million. The total enterprise value is $594.81 and tangible assets are $120 million. The key ratios are as follows: price to sales 2.6X (ttm), prices to cash flow 15.6X (ttm), price free cash flow 36.4x (ttm), price to book value 4.2X, and a PE ratio of 24X (ttm). Gross margins are 45% while the net profit margin is 10.9% (ttm).

I have been patiently following the company since the IPO and have looked at various opportunities to go long or short. The biggest shocker came in the Sept 30th quarter when the company missed forecast blaming it on the weather. It is important to note the sales pattern of the business (ttm): 36% sales come in the 1st qtr, 31% in the 2nd, 22% in the 3rd qtr, and 10% in the fourth. Therefore, the December quarter reported today after the close is the easiest quarter and I wouldn’t expect any surprises. The key is the guidance/results for the 1st and 2nd quarters of 2004.

We all know the flaws of Wall Street research. In most cases analyst are parrots for the company and do little outside research. If they dare speak to competitors, distributors, or even ex-employees it would hamper their relationship with the company and knock the firm out of investment banking opportunities. Therein lays the opportunity for truth seekers: what happened in the September quarter and how is the current booking for March quarter?

Even though Trex is the pioneer of the industry, there are several competitors that have successfully emerged: Weyerhaeuser/ AERT Inc’s ChoiceDek Plus Line (http://www.choicedek.com), Louisiana-Pacific’s WeatherBest (http://www.lpcorp/com), Tendura (http://tendura.com), Xtendex (http://www.xtendex.com), Crane Plastic’s Timbertech (http://www.timbertech.com) , ChoiceDek (http://www.choicedek.com ), Perma-Wood (800-291-5300), Dream Deck (800-245-1540), Phoenix Plastic Lumber (800-888-0880), Nexwood (http://www.neexwood.com) , Perma-Poly (http://www.renewplastics.com ), etc. These companies offer an array of product assortments (different grains, tongue and grove, colors, cone structure for lighter weight, etc). Investigative conversations with these companies indicate they were not affected by the weather in the September quarter, and that they are growing and gaining market share. Therefore, Trex is no longer the kingpin of the industry. Further conversations with ex-Trex employees, distributors, and retailers indicate an array of points. Ex-employees claim that competitors are gaining market share. Retailers indicate that Trex is weak in customer service and were late to market in railing and grained products. Most importantly, field checks indicate that first quarter bookings are only up 8-12% for the majority of Trex’s competitors; while Wall Street expects an increase of 25%! Also, there is not an overwhelming demand for the new Trex Accents line and there has been talk of price cuts.

Conclusion
I typically like to short companies that have a chance to go down 80-100% over the course of time or trading opportunities that have a specific catalyst with good risk/reward. Trex fits in the latter, either they will guide analysts down on the release/call (call next day Feb 24th 11:00AM, Ph. 888-803-7566) or they miss the first quarter estimates in the next 60 days. Expectations are for a loss of $.07 for the December quarter, mid $.70 range for the 1st quarter (actual consensus is .83 but includes an outlier of .93 that skews the mean), .65 in the second, and $1.88 for year. Revenues are expected to be up 25+% in the first quarter and 30% for the year, yet margins will come under pressure from the advent of competition and competitors gaining market share. The stock has traded in a 52-week range of $28.20-$45.00, and traded below $30 intra-day on the September 30 earnings guidance. At 15X cash flow, the stock could easily trade into the mid to high 20’s on flat to slightly higher guidance. An investor relation is not management’s greatest strength.

Risk
This trade is not without risk. The company could land a substantial contract with a large retailer. Lowe’s sells Weyerhaeuser’s product and Home Depot recently announced a product produced by Fiberon/Universal Forest Products. The demand could sharply increase for composite decking. The decking market is growing at 3-4% a year with 10% represented by composites. The short interest is big! The short interest of 2.3 million shares is 12.8% of the outstanding shares or 29% of the float.

FRMO IS unique Co. That is, it is a one of a kind business. Its model is to receive wired funds to its bank acccount for advice given to various entities including several Hedge Funds, several Mutual Funds, wrap account manager, research publication, consulting clients and related.

The P &L is devoid of compensation expense other than a phantom non cash charge required by auditing standards (called contributed services). The only expenses are for accounting servises (auditor exp) and for servicing shareholderes (cost to be public co).

The Comapny was founded by two brilliant thinkers, Murray Stahl and Steven Bregman, the founders of Horiozon Research et al. The have built a brilliantly modeled foirm at Horizon and wanted to have apublic company to channel pieces of fees they recieve for advising others, mainly as to byuing and selling stocks.

Thus they have an 8.4% interest in the advisor to the Kinetics Hedge Funds (off and on shore entities) which are now in excess of $1B iun assets. The 8.4% is share of the 1, 1.5% mgt fee and the 20% of profits performance fee.

This is a rapidly growing set of numbers. i.e. Assets, mgt fee and pewrformance fee. The share of management fee ran 368K in the latest Q ended Nov 2004. The Q-3 of fiscal year to end Feb 2005.

This set of fees alone should keep growing and do so very rapidaly

Let your mind wander. Consider on $1B under managemment a 1.5% mgt fee and a 20% up year will equal at 8.4%, is $1.260M Mgt + $3.360M performance fee.

Let your mind wander and cio=onsider assets grwoing from additional investment and performance in the 20% range. Big numbers will accumulate from just this one source.

Now it should be noted that these Hedge Funds are new and started with zero assets in 2001 and have grown steadily. Pewrformance has been +9.7. +9.9%, +43.2%, +16.1% 2001-2004. On a cumulative basis, over the 4-year 4-month period from inception through year-end 2004, the Kinetics Partners Fund has returned 124%, whereas the S&P 500 Index has lost (15%). Not bad.

At November 30, 2004 and 2003, the Company's share of he
underlying net assets of Kinetics Advisors, LLC exceeded the investment which was zero, by $1,098,532 and $613,925, respectively.

This at current annualized rate bigger things are in store for FRMO.

Another goodie FRMO acquired on is On June 1, 2004,is a one-third interest in the advisory fee revenue that Horizon Asset Management, Inc. receives from the Lehman Brothers Manager Access Program, in exchange for 4,587 shares of FRMO. common stock. Under this program, Horizon Asset Management provides investment advisory services to certain Lehman Brothers clients, the fees being calculated on the basis of assets under management. While assets under management were quite modest at the time of acquisition, they have expanded significantly and exceeded $100 million as of December 31, 2004. Management believes that they will continue to expand in future years. The five-year investment returns of the strategy utilized by this program, through December 2004, amount to about 14% per year versus the approximately 2% annualized loss for the S&P 500 Index over the same period. Thesew assests under management should grow at a healtyh rate

Executive Summary
I am recommending a long position in Avid Bioservices (CDMO, “Avid” or the “Company”) at a price of 6.82 / share (aftermarket price).  Avid Bioservices is a pure-play biologics contract manufacturer, with a base of commercial customers providing stability, a growing backlog of customers in all stages of development, and a state-of-the-art asset base.  Importantly, I believe Avid is at an interesting inflection point for profitability given the visible growth, operating leverage inherent in the manufacturing business, and continued progress with sales and marketing plans as the Company has fully-transitioned from an excess capacity manufacturer to a dedicated CDMO.  Additionally, the Company is not meaningfully economically sensitive, has a sticky customer base in a double-digit secularly growing industry with a capacity shortage, space on-site for meaningful capacity expansion, does not require significant capital to grow, and has a relatively clean balance sheet and a Board that is committed to long-term shareholder value.  Finally, as I will detail later in the Customers and Revenue Growth section, a little-known customer/program is expected to contribute meaningfully to growth in profitability and revenue in a few years, which I believe will set Avid up for a premium market valuation and is a true differentiator for the investment.  I believe this customer alone has the potential to add nearly $50mm in EBITDA in a mid-case scenario. Though it is not my base case, the entire CDMO industry has been consolidating, and I would not be surprised if Avid was ultimately acquired at an attractive valuation in the next two to three years.  I believe Avid can trade to $15+/share in the next two to three years, which is an ~27% to 48% IRR from today’s levels and meaningfully higher if I am correct that the market will discount the customer above.  Over the long-term, absent a fluke event of some kind, I believe downside is limited given the highly visible growth and operating leverage in the business and lack of meaningful economic sensitivity.
Why does this opportunity exist?
·         This is a smaller capitalization business with “bio” in the Company name.  I think that’s a pass for many, even though the reality is that this is a much easier to understand manufacturing business with great industry dynamics.
·         Some people will pass because they believe there is biotech risk.  While that may be true for some of Avid’s customers, much of Avid’s projected future revenue is from stable, multi-billion dollar companies with commercial products.
·         Avid currently is breakeven or only slightly positive from an EBITDA perspective.  This is not cheap on today’s EBITDA levels obviously, so it isn’t likely to show up on many value screens.  The combination of expected revenue growth and significant operating leverage can change that quite quickly.
  Capitalization
Company/Business Overview
Avid is a pure-play CDMO (contract development and manufacturing operation) providing a range of services from early-stage process development and cell line optimization to commercial manufacturing for biopharmaceutical products derived from mammalian cell cultures – more specifically, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).  In short, Avid makes biotech drugs for people and helps optimize the “recipe” for making those drugs. Relative to small molecule compounds which involve mixing chemicals together, biologics are materially more complex. Although contract manufacturing might seem unnecessary for many biotechs, as discussed later, increased outsourcing is a trend in biopharmaceutical manufacturing, especially for smaller R&D-centric organizations as more innovation is from VC-backed entities and as therapies are for smaller populations of patients.  Importantly, Avid has a long history of commercial production, a differentiating factor versus many other CDMOs, by virtue of its relationship with Halozyme (HALO). Avid has two primary facilities, both located on its campus in Tustin, CA; an older facility, Franklin, with predominantly stainless steel bioreactors (old way) and which has subsequently been partially refurbished and used for process development work and its new state of the art Myford 1 facility, which is 42k square feet and uses single-use bioreactors up to 2,000L scale.  Single-use manufacturing is the current standard and has many advantages over older stainless steel manufacturing techniques. Importantly, the Company is in final stages to expand to a Myford 2, which is next door to the Myford 1 facility and should provide approximately $150mm of incremental revenue capacity once complete. Today’s revenue capacity between both process development services and commercial manufacturing is approximately $100-125mm.
Prior to 2018, the Company was named “Peregrine Pharmaceuticals” and was primarily a research and development focused biotechnology company with a mostly crooked management team and Board.  Manufacturing for third-party clients was largely an afterthought and existed only to continue to funnel money into drug development and to line the pockets of the previous regime. During 2017, an activism campaign highlighted the egregious conduct, ultimately leading to a replacement of the Board and management team and a shift in focus to a dedicated CDMO, also partially driven by the failure of the lead R&D candidate.  The Board is now a top-notch collection of industry executives, all with extensive experience growing and ultimately selling companies. More on that later…The Company is now fully transitioned and is slowly winning new customers, growing existing customers, and improving capabilities as a dedicated CDMO. It is important to note that this is a significant change and it does take time. The perception of Avid had to change significantly in the marketplace – from an excess capacity player run by a joke management team to a legitimate full-service CDMO with several multi-billion dollar clients.  As the Company continues to present at industry conferences and outsourcing events, I believe the fruits of their labor will be rewarded, especially considering the tight supply/demand dynamics in the industry.
Today, Avid is generating approximately $64mm-$67mm in revenue and should be breakeven to slightly positive on an EBITDA basis this year.  It is worth noting the business is lumpy quarter to quarter. Production runs can be significant amounts of revenue and their timing is heavily customer-dependent.  I think investing in Avid and understanding this industry means you look at this on a long-term basis and understand that the outlook is quite bright. Although it is only slightly EBITDA positive today, operating leverage is quite significant as most of the operating costs are fixed.  As a result, it is not unusual to see incremental EBITDA margins in the 65-70% range as revenue grows from here (CFO said 50-70% on the last quarterly call). Ultimately, many biologics CDMOs have margins in the low to mid 30s (Catalent actually says high 30s%). Anywhere close to those numbers would make an investment in Avid a wild success from here.  Finally, as of the last 10K released in July of 2019, the Company finally removed its going concern language. That is a significant positive, not only because customers likely viewed the language unfavorably, but because when auditors remove this language it is based on projections and an assessment of future profitability and sustainability. I believe this is a very positive sign that the future at Avid is strong.
  Positive Industry Backdrop
Although many know the positives of the CDMO space, it is worth quickly rehashing why these tend to be very good businesses, why biologic manufacturing specifically (as opposed to small molecule manufacturing from CDMOs such as Cambrex or Recro) is even more advantageous, and why Avid’s particular scale is the sweet spot for the industry.  A number of factors are contributing to the sticky double-digit growth in biologics today and for the foreseeable future:
·         Trend towards biologics vs. small molecules – Although there is growth across the CDMO space, biologics in particular are projected to grow in the double digits for the foreseeable future.  Biologics are an increasing percentage of the R&D pipeline and an increasing percentage of total drug approvals. Additionally, as several blockbuster biologics come off patent, biosimilars will be another opportunity for the CDMO space.

  ·         Trend towards outsourcing and smaller scale biologics – As the biologics industry overall is expected to grow significantly, an increased trend towards outsourcing yields torqued growth for biologics CDMOs.  There are several reasons for the incremental outsourcing. First, many of the “mega” therapeutic categories have largely been pursued already. Many of the drugs in the pipelines today are to treat smaller populations and are typically backed by VCs.  These smaller research-centric firms are the lifeblood of the biotech industry, as the larger players focus more on established compounds, sales and marketing, and ultimately buying the successful research-centric companies. Because of the smaller scale and the fact that these companies are typically more capital constrained, they almost always find contract manufacturers to help with development and production as opposed to building their own manufacturing capacity.  Few small biotechs want to take unnecessary risks in manufacturing. It is hard enough to develop the science behind these therapeutics so companies would rather focus on their competitive advantages (research) and be able to scale quickly and reliably with contract manufacturers. Additionally, smaller scale CDMOs (2K Liters) are important because smaller biotechs feels like they have a real seat at the table as opposed to contracting with behemoths such as Lonza or Samsung Biologics.  Finally, building a single facility makes little sense for any single smaller biotech. By taking multiple customers, CDMOs are able to leverage regulatory expertise and manufacturing capacity.

  ·         High switching costs – Once CDMOs win business, it is typically very sticky.  Data on manufacturing and inspections of facilities are actually part of the FDA application for biologics.  Because biologics are produced from animal cells, you cannot really guarantee every production run is exactly the same.  Because of this, the FDA is even more rigorous in its approach and ensures manufacturing processes are part of biologics approvals.  Companies typically do process validation runs in later stages of drug development that provide inputs for the application process. This step is expensive (tens of millions in some cases), so companies are reluctant to repeat them to switch manufacturers, especially when the existing manufacturer is already doing a good job.  This also applies in the case of mergers as it is typically the case that the manufacturing does not move in-house after biotechs are acquired if the products are commercial or are in the later stages of development. High switching costs also tend to help CDMOs win incremental molecules from the same customers that have already vetted the facilities, processes and regulatory track record.
·         High Barriers to Entry and Low Capital Needs – CDMOs are good businesses in my opinion, because the barriers to entry are typically regulatory experience/track record-based.  As previously mentioned, few small biotechs want to risk engaging in business with CDMOs that are unproven or have a large history of failing inspections or other regulatory issues.  Additionally, the process to produce commercially is long and complex, and having experience is very important to prospective customers. Biologics are akin to making a 747 vs. small molecules which is more like assembling a car.  For these reasons, it is very difficult to simply build a new manufacturing facility as an outsider and expect to win meaningful business. I think this is exactly why new entrants to the space typically buy their way in at prices that are well in excess of traditional “replacement cost” metrics.  The barrier isn’t really about the facility alone, but more about one’s experience in using the facility. It is true a risk would be overbuilding by existing industry players, but there is no evidence that is occurring today and the industry is pretty vocal about not building facilities on speculation.  Additionally, because the lead time to build is a few years (between physical plant and regulatory validation) and the industry is growing rapidly, demand continues to outpace supply, pricing remains strong, and players with capacity today are advantaged. Because of this intangible barrier to entry, capital costs tend to be low relative to the unit economics achievable.  CDMOs are highly cash generative businesses when manufacturing sites are full.
In short, for the CDMO space, the rich seem to be getting richer.  In my opinion, this is a space that will continue to see strong M&A multiples given the growth and strong dynamics for existing players.
  Avid’s Competitive Advantage
·         Strong Regulatory Track Record – In my view, this is the single strongest thing that Avid possesses.  They have gone through multiple FDA inspections with no 483 violations and they have a long track record of manufacturing success, including process validation work which is critical for biologic license applications (BLAs) filed with the FDA.  Importantly, you cannot just create a regulatory track record, except for executing over a long period of time. As a result, Avid’s barrier is not a capital expenditure barrier, but a know-how barrier, leading to higher ROICs and justifying larger multiples for acquisitions in the space.  Essentially, in this industry the rich get richer, and new entrants buy their way in.
·         State of the Art Facilities – Having spoken to several industry experts who have both toured the facilities and evaluated it seemingly from an M&A perspective years ago, the Myford facility truly has a “wow” factor.  It is a single-use bioreactor facility which is the current industry preference, and the new process development labs show very well to new customers.
·         Geographic Advantage – Avid is located in southern California, which is a hotbed of biopharma activity and is partially why they won the initial business from Halozyme.  It is ripe with biopharma human capital and new potential customers.
·         Scale Benefits – Somewhat perversely, Avid is advantaged partially because they only have 2,000L bioreactors.  Although others in the space have more capacity, many of the new molecules being developed do not require such large volumes and the economics will not work at scales meaningfully larger.  Additionally, smaller, newer, and perhaps single-product biopharma companies are reluctant to engage with the larger CDMOs as they know they will be treated like the low man on the totem pole.
·         Commercial Manufacturing Track Record – Avid is one of the few CDMOs out there that has extensive commercial manufacturing experience.  They can take a product from development stages, scale the process, help with necessary regulatory approvals, and produce at commercial scale.  If you are a biopharma company, this is a large benefit to you, as the last thing you want to do is switch contract manufacturers at various stages in the process.
  Customers and Revenue Growth
Although revenue growth will be lumpy quarter to quarter, and potentially even year to year, there are many clues that point to a bright future for Avid.  First, at its 2018 Annual Meeting, the Company’s CEO stated that the existing customers already have enough projected future demand to fill all of Myford 1 and 2, though obviously not for several years.  Still, since that time the Company has continued to win new customers and diversify revenue away from their core commercial customer, Halozyme. A snapshot of Avid revenue and backlog is below:
Backlog only represents signed commitments, but the reality is there is a much larger “soft backlog” in addition to this number because no company would start certain stages of the process without continuing to later stages unless the product failed.  On an LTM basis bookings are above $80mm. The Company has done a good job of diversifying revenue in recent years as can be seen by revenue from the “Other” category increasing. As time goes on, they have also won new molecules from existing customers, another vital source of growth.  Finally, the Company completed a new process development laboratory, which will help win early-stage molecules that will hopefully ultimately become commercial products.
Below is a summary of Avid’s key customers, which I believe gives confidence on the growth outlook, as well as massive upside potential for the equity in a few years, specifically from Coherus.  Importantly, Avid has recently completed three process validation campaigns, which are typically done prior to the launch of commercial production or relevant BLA filings.
Halozyme (HALO) – Any discussion of Avid starts with a discussion of Halozyme.  Halozyme is a biotech company that makes a compound (rH for short) that is paired with other drugs to allow for subcutaneous administration which rapidly shortens the time to treat patients.  So, for many chemotherapy drugs, Halozyme’s product can be paired with the chemo drug to reduce multiple hours of infusions down to only a few minutes, which is a major patient advantage and helps innovator drug companies fend off generic competition.  Halozyme is paid a royalty on sales of drugs that use rH, as well as for the raw material rH they sell to their partners. As Halozyme has transitioned away from its R&D pursuits to focus only on its royalty business, I expect partnerships to increase over time which will increase the need for raw material to be used in trials and eventually for commercial use.  HALO exclusively uses Avid and Cook (now owned by Catalent) for manufacturing. Although Halozyme revenue for Avid has decreased recently, it is because Roche, a large customer for HALO, was transitioning from Avid’s Franklin facility to the newer Myford facility, which requires validation runs and re-filing with the FDA. It is expected that Roche will start to build inventory again (creating the need to purchase more from HALO) now that process validation is complete.  Roche is also expected to file another NDA for rH in combination with Perjeta/Herceptin in early 2020. As Halozyme continues to grow, I believe Avid will also be supplying to other potential Halozyme customers, and the Avid management team already believes some of the product is going to parties besides Roche. It is important to note that HALO isn’t really that risky when it comes to trials. The product works with other medicines that are already approved – I do not believe they have failed any trial yet.  This is mostly about blocking and tackling when it comes to partnering, running the validating trials, and ultimately selling the rH with the partner drug to collect royalties. The following quotes from HALO are helpful in understanding how they think about the trajectory of long-term API sales:
Question from 5/7/19 Call: “…if you think about $1bn in royalties in 2027, what would be the level of API sales supporting that $1bn in royalties.”
Answer: “…We have said that they would increase substantially year over year, and in fact, kind of going back to even above the 2017 sort of levels.  And again that’s being driven by partners as they’re getting ready for more clinical studies and potential commercialization…And then as far as the future, it – over time, certainly API sales should approximate the volume in the market, but our partners are ordering in a not regular pattern…so you can’t necessarily equate API in any given year to…the amount of [royalties] in that year.  But certainly over time, they will approximate each other.”
Royalty revenue for HALO is expected to grow at a 40% CAGR from 2020 to 2027.  If that happens, API sales should grow significantly and Avid will benefit strongly from today’s HALO revenue levels.
ADC Therapeutics – I don’t know too much about this customer as they were disclosed in the most recent 10K.  As far as I know, this is a pre-IPO biotech (actually pulled their IPO in September) focused on cancer treatments with a current private valuation in excess of $2bn on a recent $300mm Series E financing, so it seems legitimate.  Avid has been doing work for ADC for the past few years, suggesting they are probably in Phase II or beyond. I am just speculating, but it is possible one of Avid’s process validation campaigns was for ADC, in which case this is probably for their lead drug ADCT-402.  That would likely mean commercial production in 2021, as ADC is expected to file its FDA biologics license application (BLA) in the second half of 2020.
Top 10 Pharm Customer – Obviously, I don’t know who this is, but it was announced in July of 2019.  I view it as a positive that a top 10 global pharma customer would enter into a contract with Avid, because they would have diligenced all the facilities and capabilities of the Company. 
Coherus (CHRS) – Using commentary from the previous management team, current management, revenue trends from Coherus, and the timing of the final process validation run, I believe it is highly likely that Avid is the manufacturer for Coherus’ biosimilar of Humira.  In fact, I believe the Myford facility was actually built expecting enormous demand from Coherus, only to see them lose the patent challenge and have to delay market launch until 2023.  I think reading old transcripts from 2017 make this pretty clear. Humira, in case you are unfamiliar, is the largest drug on the market today, with expected branded sales approaching $15bn by the time biosimilar competition hits.  There are a few approved biosimilars on the market that will launch competitively in 2023 (settled with Abbvie), but it seems like any way you cut it, this should be a huge opportunity for Avid, probably in early 2023 or late 2022 when CHRS starts to build inventory in advance of a launch.  In the interim I’m sure there will be other manufacturing runs to prepare. I believe this is being largely ignored and/or analysts have not yet figured this out. As a hypothetical, a few numbers below:
Although Avid analysts haven’t noticed, several CHRS analysts believe this will be a several hundred million revenue product for CHRS, and relatively quickly.  The Company has executed well on its existing product in the market, which bodes well for launch of Humira in a few years. CHRS at a recent conference believes the Humira biosimilar opportunity could be up to $1bn in annual revenue.  Assuming 20% COGS for the product, which they’ve alluded to publicly, that would be over $100mm in incremental EBITDA to Avid.  Even lower cases are still enormous for Avid.  $50mm of incremental EBITDA at even 15x is over $13/share. It is hard to see how this won’t be meaningful and CHRS is expected to file its BLA in early 2020.  I think the filing and ultimately approval could be catalysts for Avid as it will be clear who they intend to use for manufacturing. As discussed below, I don’t even think CHRS will actually impact results as much as it will valuation…
  Projections/Valuation
It is hard to model this precisely on an annual basis as the business will be lumpy.  But, for reasons outlined above regarding both the industry tailwinds and company specific factors, I believe Avid can compound revenue in excess of 20% for the next several years, BEFORE Coherus even impacts results.  The rough algorithm is that these types of businesses can earn 30-35% EBITDA margins when fully optimized (capacity full), and a few years ago Avid was earning nearly 50% gross margins when it only had the Franklin facility.  The steady growth of the business should yield nearly $40mm of EBITDA in a few years and these businesses have traded in the public markets at high teens EBITDA multiples or even greater, with acquisition multiples in the 20s in some cases.  As time goes on, and with Avid as essentially the only pure-play CDMO, I believe the Company will demand a premium valuation in the market.  If you believe the market is a forward earnings discounting mechanism, what price will investors be willing to pay when they see they prospect of $50+mm of INCREMENTAL EBITDA from Coherus that will begin ramping in 2023?  I suspect it will be a large multiple and I believe it will be justified. Having spoken to industry experts familiar with the CMC Biologics deal at ~23x EBITDA, a large reason for the valuation was that buyers all saw the tremendous growth ahead.  Ultimately, I believe Avid will be a $1bn+ business as EBITDA approaches $40mm, and meaningfully higher when investors begin to discount revenue to Coherus. Various biologics/CDMO M&A comps are below. If anything, multiples appear to be increasing in the space.
I believe the Board “gets it” and expect that Avid will ultimately be put up for sale in a few years.  The Board is well-qualified and very well networked in the industry. I think it is well understood that smaller companies like this tend not to get full value in public markets, and a few board members have history building and selling companies or have been involved in M&A transactions.

  CEO Departure/Current Management
The old CEO, Roger Lias, seems to have been let go/“resigned” in May 2019.  He had been hand-picked by the previous regime, so it is hard to feel terribly about him leaving.  My suspicion is that the current Board gave him some room and time to work, but ultimately were disappointed with his ability to win business fast enough.  I think that’s actually a positive sign. This is a hot industry with a lot of tailwinds. I think the bar is pretty high and this is a Board that demands success, or at the very least, participating in the industry tailwinds like everyone else.  In the interim, Rick Hancock has taken over as CEO. He has experience in the CDMO space, is well respected and networked within the industry, and is bringing in other capable leaders. Business development is being run by Tracy Kinjerski who previously had a stop at CMC Biologics (sold for ~22-25x EBITDA…).  I think she is very motivated to grow this business and prove that she can lead the business development effort before whatever her next gig will ultimately be. The CFO Dan Hart is good in my opinion and tends to lean a little conservative when it comes to commentary and forecasting is my impression. They also recently hired somebody to lead operations who had previously been with the Company years ago.  I view it as a positive that he would come back to Avid based on the outlook he sees today.
Conclusion 
Overall, I believe CDMO is a compelling long-term investment where investors will make multiples of money over time.  The Company has an advantaged asset base in a growing industry, with an enormous opportunity coming from Coherus in the future.  Even without Coherus, as revenue continues to grow and EBITDA grows significantly faster, I believe Avid will continue to move higher as EBITDA potential becomes more widely understood.

As a great source of investment returns, Charlie Munger is to have said to pay close attention to cannibal companies – that is, businesses that are buying back a huge amount of their stock.  Microstrategy (MSTR) is one of these cannibals.
  Thesis
MSTR is a deep-value software stock and a free call option on its improving sales trend.  Given all the hype around Big Data, one would think that MSTR would get more love as a business intelligence vendor.  Yet, this is one of the most hated stocks because investors are concerned about (1) new competitive threats; (2) management changes and (3) a controlling CEO.  I believe these fears are overblown. 
At just 2.7x recurring maintenance revenue, MSTR has very little downside. While MSTR deserves to trade at a discount to its faster growing peers, the valuation gap is so wide (over 10x EV/maintenance revenue for peers) that it just doesn’t make sense.  In fact, few software companies trade for less than 3x maintenance, and those that do are either illiquid and/or have weak competitive positions.  In my upside case, MSTR should be valued closer to $140-150/share (5x maintenance) as it starts growing its license revenue over easier quarterly comps.  This represents 50-60% upside.
Importantly, I believe MSTR will aggressively buy back its shares as it did during 2005-2010 when it bought back $470m of stock and reduced shares outstanding by 36%.  The company recently divested its non-core business for $110m to boost its already over-capitalized balance sheet. 
Company background
Microstrategy is one of the pioneers of business intelligence (BI) software.  Founded in 1989 by current CEO Michael Saylor, the company develops software that helps organizations analyze internal and external data in order to make business decisions and to develop mobile apps.  MSTR’s BI platform has a strong reputation for being the most complex in terms of functionality, having a large numbers of users, high data volume and wide deployment across an enterprise.  Its impressive customer list includes Google, eBay, Priceline, Netflix and Visa.  MSTR’s meteoric rise from its IPO debut in 1998 was met by an accounting scandal in 2000 that saw its stock lost over 90% of its value within a few weeks.  The company subsequently cleaned up its book, but the CEO decided to stop talking to Wall Street.  Since then, MSTR has focused on growing its business organically with revenue increasing from $175m in 2003 to $595m in 2012 (15% CAGR). 
Why this opportunity exists
Fear #1: New competitive threats. Qlik Tech and Tableau are Wall Street’s latest Big Data darlings and competitors to MSTR.  Comparing MSTR’s declining license revenue over the past four quarters to Qlik Tech and Tableau’s rapid growth, one may conclude that MSTR is finished.
Why this concern is overblown: My checks with BI consultants and customers indicate that Qlik and Tableau have great data visualization tools and are easier to use, but they are not scalable.  Thus, Qlik and Tableau cannot displace MSTR for large volume of data and users.  What the newer BI tools have done is to expand the use of BI to even wider audience. They are often used in conjunction with MSTR as the customers’ BI platform.  MSTR has not stood idle and has been improving its data visualization tools to better compete against Qlik and Tableau.  Gartner has continued to rate MSTR highly in its most recent Magic Quadrant for BI and Analytics Platforms (http://www.gartner.com/technology/reprints.do?id=1-1DZLPEP&ct=130207&st=sb).  Net-net: MSTR is not a dinosaur even though it’s trading like one.
Fear #2: Management changes. MSTR’s prior COO and head of sales were replaced in October 2012 after two straight quarters of license decline.
Why this concern is overblown: The change obviously has not produced an immediate impact as license revenue continued to decline for two more quarters.  This is not unexpected as it typically takes some time for the new heads of sales to effect results.  At MSTR, the COO and head of sales were replaced with internal candidates so I’d expect the transition pain not to persist.  Q2 2013 will be the first “easy” comp for license revenue (versus -5% license growth in Q2 2012) and should get easier for the following three quarters (versus negative double-digit license decline in prior year quarters).
Fear #3: Controlling CEO. Saylor owns 18% economic interests and 64% voting power through super-voting Class B shares.  Other than the required SEC filings, MSTR does not talk to Wall Street.  Thus, analyst estimates are all over the place since they receive zero guidance.  CEO has been investing internally since 2010 to drive growth at the expense of near-term profit. 
Why this concern is overblown: No doubt the stock would see a significant pop if Saylor was somehow removed.  His presence is an obstacle to activists and takeover interests.  He has made some questionable decisions.  Nevertheless, I do not believe Saylor is driving this company into the ground.  First, he has over $200m stake in the company.  Second, he deserves some credit for building this company from scratch to $500m in annual revenue without acquisitions.  Third, Saylor was early in recognizing the importance of mobile and invested in the platform.  MSTR is now the leader in mobile BI. 
I think it’s fair to question MSTR’s recent lack of profitability.  But one should note that MSTR has a high operating leverage model given that its license and maintenance revenues have 95% gross margins.  In the past MSTR delivered operating margins as high as 35%.  Since 2010, Saylor has decided to sacrifice profit for higher growth (as many highly-valued software companies are doing today).  As a result, MSTR generated 20%+ revenue growth in 2010 and 2011, but stumbled in 2012.  I believe Saylor is likely to keep investing in new products and marketing to reaccelerate growth.  I also believe Saylor can dial back on spending and produce at least 20-25%+ operating margins if he wanted to (albeit with slower revenue growth).  In any case, at 2.7x maintenance and with a roster of Fortune 500 customers, MSTR is a free call option on its improving sales trend.
Valuation
Granted, MSTR should trade nowhere close to Qlik and Tableau.  But the valuation gap between MSTR and its peers are just too wide to make any sense (see Table 1).  MSTR’s valuation implies that it is forever irrelevant.  That’s just not the case if you speak to customers.  Even a smaller peer Actuate trades at a premium to MSTR even though its maintenance revenue is in decline.
Table 1: BI Peers EV to total revenue and EV to maintenance revenue
Actuate (BIRT): 1.9x, 3.8x
Informatica (INFA): 4x, 9.1x
Qlik Tech (QLIK): 6x, 18.8x
Tableau (DATA): 22x, 80x
Microstrategy (MSTR): 1.3x, 2.7x
JPMorgan software analyst John Difucci has an excellent primer on why software vendors with stable and high-margin maintenance streams should have a baseline M&A valuation of 5x maintenance revenue.  Please see his weekly software piece for more details.  Most of MSTR’s direct BI competitors were taken out in 2007 by Oracle, IBM and SAP at multiples much higher than where MSTR is at today (see Table 2).
Table 2: Comparable transactions EV to total revenue and EV to maintenance
Applix acquired by Cognos: 5x, 10x
Cognos acquire by IBM: 4.3x, 9x
Business Objects acquired by SAP: 3.6x, 9x
Hyperion acquired by Oracle: 3.4x, 7.7x
I believe MSTR should be valued closer to $140-150/share (5x maintenance) as it starts growing its license revenue over easier quarterly comps.  Even without strong license revenue growth, I do not believe MSTR will stay at less than 3x maintenance forever.  With nearly 1/3 of its current market cap in cash, MSTR is likely to buy back shares in meaningful amounts, as it did during 2005-2010 when it bought back $470m of stock and reduced shares outstanding by 36%. 
  Risks
New entrants Tableau and Qlik continue to drive wider adoption and improve scalability, leaving MSTR to a smaller market niche.
Potential customers accept inferior but “free” BI tools from IBM, SAP and Oracle.
Saylor manages the company for his own benefit.
I do not hold a position of employment, directorship, or consultancy with the issuer.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.
Catalyst
Easier license revenue comp: MSTR’s past 4 quarters of license revenue decline coincided with high double-digit growth comparisons in prior quarters.  Beginning Q2 2013, the comparison gets easier.   While MSTR may still not climb out of its Q1 hole completely in Q2, I’d expect license growth to return in Q3 with a -19% comparable growth quarter the year before.
Share buyback: MSTR was aggressively buying back its stock prior to 2011 but took a pause the past two years, most likely as it sacrificed profit for growth.  With the stock now trading at low multiples again, I expect Saylor to step up his buyback.  The company recently divested the last of its two non-core businesses for $110m to boost its already over-capitalized balance sheet.  Saylor has shown no inclination to make acquisitions.  His past capital allocation track record strongly indicates that an aggressive share buyback is in the cards.   Recently the Board extended its buyback program, which was scheduled to expire at the end of April 2013, to April 2018.  The program had $455m of stock remaining available for repurchase.",8.411214857526652,34.98764597855549,34.59018435654491,70.13643003099826,2.132893105652436,6.818865874549241,14.340056602804413,22.45203855019227
2011-04-13,hbomb5,AGO,ASSURED GUARANTY LTD,https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/ASSURED_GUARANTY_LTD/0614602113,3128000000.0,17.0,"Description
I believe that Assured Guaranty presents a compelling long-term investment opportunity at 4.8 times 2011 earnings estimates, 82% of book value and 34% of adjusted book value. That cheapness comes with uncertainty that breaks down into three areas: 1) structured finance, 2) S&P changes and 3) municipal bonds. This was largely written prior to this morning's news and it may take some time to digest the full impact but it is significantly positive.
I will not spend a lot of time on the business as there are three prior VIC write-ups to reference and to note for how the company has changed over the years. AGO is a mono-line insurer for financial guaranty. Translation: They insure bonds against default. They are also the last mono-line insurer of financial guaranty, depending on what happens to MBIA's attempt to create a new subsidiary to insure public finance.
Financial guaranty is the ultimate long-tail insurance. While structured finance deals pay premiums quarterly or yearly, public finance pays the entire premium up front and it is non-refundable. Premiums are then earned over the life of the bond issue. 75% of their book is on municipal bonds and 25% on structured finance bonds, compared to about 55% public finance and 45% structured finance in 2005. This dramatic shift occurred because most of their new business over the past three years has been municipal and the fact that structured finance runs off faster. Both areas have been receiving a lot of bad press that has investors shooting first and asking questions later with regards to AGO's legacy business.
CEO Dominic Frederico has overseen AGO from its separation from ACE in 2004 to present. He is no shrinking violet, which has proved valuable during the past few years. When S&P announced their proposed changes this past January, Dominic came out swinging with an investor call that tore into the proposed changes. He also has skin in the game, owning $8 million in shares with 1.3 million in options. He was an active buyer with his own money at $3, $11 and $14. Investors also have Wilbur Ross, who owns 8.7% of AGO, on the board. Ross bought 10.6 million shares in 2008 at $23.47, bought more during the equity raise and has not sold a share.
So let's look at the three issues and then I will get into more detail about the upside.
  1. Structured Finance/RMBS
The great irony for AGO is that they were AA-rated for many years and lost a lot of RMBS structured finance business to then AAA-rated Ambac and MBIA. Meanwhile, Ambac has filed for bankruptcy and MBIA has had to restructure and put the structured finance business into run-off. AGO ended up winning by losing. However, the reserves relative to the net par outstanding are not large, which makes investors unduly nervous..
There is a huge issue about the underwriting quality of residential mortgages. It is being played out via the representations and warranties (""R&W"") clause that allows holders of mortgages to put back bad mortgages to the originators. The result is that MBI and AGO are battling BAC, WFC and JPM, which you now see popping up in earnings calls and the like.
An amazing statistic from AGO's 4th quarter2010  conference call:
""As of year-end 2010, we had reviewed over 53,000 individual loan files, aggregating to $8.5 billion of loans, and identified breaches of rep and warranties on approximately 48,000 of those loans equal to $7.8 billion. To date, we have now obtained repurchase commitments from six counter-parties across 23 transactions, a significant improvement.""
 Meanwhile, JPM lost a suit involving use of sampling of mortgages:
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/28/jpmorgan-loses-court-ruli_n_841484.html
 If you understand the situation, the following is pretty funny:
http://www.propertycasualty360.com/2011/03/25/banks-say-mbia-undervalued-losses-by-as-much-as-10
The banks that took out insurance on their securitizations for the benefit of the bondholders are trying to push MBIA into insolvency. [Separately, from what I have heard, the Article 78 suit brought against MBIA by the banks is unlikely to succeed because they have to show that the NY Insurance Department did not follow procedure, which is a high hurdle.] Since the financial guarantors pay the bondholders directly, the banks do not receive any of the loss proceeds unless they are also bondholders. The banks are not spending millions to help the bondholders - they want these mortgages buried so they don't boomerang back to them. The problem for the banks is that the financial guarantors are making full use of the put-back feature under the R&W - and the banks will do anything to try and stop the put-backs.
AGO has certain rights within the securitizations trusts, allowing them to make important changes. They learned very quickly that some mortgage servicers do a poor job with preventing and handling delinquencies, especially those servicers who are part of the selling bank and thus conflicted. By exercising mortgage servicing rights, AGO can improve loss outcomes through more pro-active servicing carriers and by removing bad loans. AGO estimates that they can recover $1.4 billion through this process. Due to a quirk in FAS 167, once AGO exercises their rights, they have to consolidate the trusts onto their balance sheet because they are deemed to have contol.
I believe that all of the banks will ultimately settle with Ambac, MBIA and AGO, even as MBIA and AGO recently turned up the heat by accusing the banks of fraud before a hearing at the NY state assembly. Some banks have already settled, where the insurance policies were commuted - essentially cancelling the policy. The last thing that the banks want is a lawsuit revealing what actually went on, particularly those banks (BAC, JPM, WFC) who bought their problems. While the insurer has to refund the premiums, all losses associated with the policy are erased from their books. It is a good trade for AGO.
A lot of the problems have been with 2nd liens, a.k.a. HELOCs. The good news is that the HELOC problems appear to have peaked. In the 2010 10-K, on p.96, it shows a credit of $805.7 million for HELOC's for Present Value of Next Expected Loss and LAE to be Paid. A decent chunk of that relates to R&W and with one bank. You can guess the bank by looking on p. 35 of the 4th Quarter 2010 Financial Supplement for the Top 50 US Structured Finance Exposures:
http://www.assuredguaranty.com/Documents/AGLFS%20December%2031,%202010.pdf
The settlement with Bank of America will be remove a significant overhang.
Due to the nature of repayments and amortization, the structured finance portfolio will likely shrink in half over the next three years. From 12/31/2009 to 12/31/2010, US RMBS net par outstanding ran down from $29.2 billion to $25.1 billion, or a 14% decrease. As an aside, CMBS exposure stood at $7.1 billion of net par exposure as of 12/31/2010, which is much smaller than RMBS.
  2. S&P Changes
Standard & Poors unveiled proposed new requirements for financial guaranty insurers in January 2011 and requested comments through 3/25/2011. AGO responded early and often with some blistering comments:
http://www.assuredguaranty.com/Documents/Second_Letter_to_SP_with_attachments_03252011.pdf
Transcript and presentation of 2/1/2011 investor call on S&P:
http://www.assuredguaranty.com/Documents/SP%20Call%2002022011%20Transcript%20vF.pdf
http://www.assuredguaranty.com/Documents/SP%20Presentation%20for%20Call%2002-01-2011v2.pdf
AGO makes numerous arguments against the S&P proposal. The most cogent is that the S&P uses the same 40 year-old Hempel study of municipal bonds during the 1930's depression for their proposal as was used initially back in the 1970's to set up the current scheme. There are two main concerns with the proposal: One involving the exclusion of unearned premium reserves (UPR) and lower leverage tests.
a. UPR - This is the biggest concern because it could potentially require AGO to raise $1.9 billion of capital to maintain its AA-rating. If UPR is included (which their primary regulator, the NY State Insurance Department, does), AGO would already qualify for AAA. That is a big difference, but not that it matters. AGO needs the S&P more than the S&P needs AGO. If you are into conspiracy theories, one could say that the S&P is looking to kill the financial guaranty business. A more likely approach is that the S&P needs to re-establish its credibility and is taking a hard-line approach.
The ratings business is very lucrative. A review of McGraw-Hill (MHP) shows that while the S&P division accounts for only 25% of revenue, it provides over half the operating profits. Operating margins are in the high 40's for the S&P, so this is a business that will be hard for them to walk away from.
I think there is only a 25% chance of the UPR exclusion sticking. The main two regulators of financial guaranty insurance in the U.S., the state insurance departments of New York and Maryland, both include UPR in their claims paying ability for financial guaranty. My understanding is that statutory accounting does not use UPR and recognizes the premiums immediately and thus available to pay claims. The wild card is what the guys in the JC Penney suits decide but the fact that their UPR proposal goes against insurance accounting shows how flawed it is.
b. Lower Leverage Test - The second concern is lower leverage tests. While no official test currently exists, many believe it is 150 to 1, meaning for every $150 of par value of bonds insured, there needs to be $1 of capital backing it. The proposal calls for 75 to 1 leverage for AAA in public finance and 20 to 1 for AAA in structured, effectively doubling the capital requirements at the minimum. Fighting this requirement will not be easy with the Ambac bankruptcy poster child hanging around.
One clear benefit from the overall S&P proposal would be transparency and objectivity in the rating levels. There is a general sense of how the rating agencies have determined levels in the past but it has been more ""double-secret probation"" in nature. To be credible, the S&P has to establish that they are objective in how they rates things and are not ""AAA"" sellers.
  3. Municipal Bonds
Most people have seen or heard the doom-and-gloom predictions for municipal bonds in 2011. Besides the information presented by AGO showing debt service levels for municipalities are actually much lower than during the Depression, Bloomberg had this interesting tidbit in an article about the Vallejo bankruptcy:
""Since 1937, 619 local government bodies, mostly small utility or sewer districts, have filed for bankruptcy, according to Spiotto. In contrast, there were more than 11,000 Chapter 11 filings, used by companies to reorganize debt, in 2009 alone.
Local-government bankruptcies will ""be minimal and isolated to mismanaged or weak credits,"" BlackRock Inc., the world's largest money manager, told clients on Dec. 7. States such as Pennsylvania and Rhode Island have become increasingly active in helping prevent them, it said.""
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-14/vallejo-s-california-bankruptcy-failure-scares-cities-into-cost-cutting.html
AGO did a presentation last summer and Frederico made several insightful comments. He noted that outside of general obligation bonds, many munis are tied to specific streams of revenues. [Check out the Denver Convention Center Hotel idea recently submitted by nha855 as an example.] Defaults tend to be more about unwillingness to pay as opposed to inability to pay. Governments own two unique assets - the ability to tax and the ability to apply tax liens. Plus, governments cannot be liquidated and only about half the states even allow municipalities to even file for bankruptcy. That is why muni bond issuers say that they have few real losses. AGO may make interest payments to bondholders for a while, they rarely have to pay principal, and then they recoup what they paid from the municipalities. Sort of like pay-day loans for governments.
Most problems tend to be cities and counties, where things can get out of control. Noted examples in the news are Harrisburg, PA and Jefferson County, AL. In reading the news about both situations, bankruptcy is not really an option and their respective state governments are now involved in the process. While both have received considerable news coverage, they are largely isolated instances stemming from corruption and mismanagement.
Nouriel Roubini has indicated that there might be between $30 billion to $100 billion of defaults over the next five years but with almost 100% recoveries:
http://www.financialsense.com/node/4679
---------------------------------------------------
Debt - AGO has between $22-32 million of debt maturing over the next three years. $189 million of debt will be due in 2014, but then no meaningful debt will be due until 2034.
Buffett - I figure this will come up, so might as well address it. Berkshire Hathaway famously entered the financial guaranty market in 2007 to insure muni bonds and then pulled out in 2009 because of less than firm pricing. Is that an indication that the financial guaranty business is bad? I do not think so because Buffett was looking for opportunistic pricing in what is a small side business for Berkshire. Berkshire had a very small presence that limited meaningful deal flow. Meanwhile, WEB is willing to accept lower returns in bigger businesses like Burlington Northern and Lubrizol.
Earnings - With a $10 billion investment portfolio, AGO generates almost $2/sh in pretax investment income per year. As the bond book seasons, losses will drop. Analysts' estimates are $3.11 to $3.85/sh for 2011, and $2.91 to $3.56/sh for 2012. A lot depends on the outcome of the above issues and it is difficult to extrapolate much from the past few years.
A rough gauge would be to consider $2+/sh in EBIT for investment income and add an equal amount of underwriting gain. Taking out taxes from $4+/sh in EBIT gets into the range of the analysts.
AGO should benefit from several trends. Last year, new premiums were down despite a rebound in municipal bond deals that totaled $429 billion. The President's Build America Bonds program, a.k.a. BAB's, provided interest subsidies or tax credits for qualifying municipal bonds, making the bonds attractive to investors without the need for insuring the bonds. BAB's ended in 2010 and it is unlikely to gain support in the Republican controlled House, so AGO should be able to wrap more bonds. Also, there is going to be a point where the US government decides to get out of insuring mortgage loans and there will be more non-agency MBS issued than the $63 billion issued in 2010 now that the credit rating liability contained in the Dodd-Frank Act has been nullified.
Due to the nature of financial guaranty accounting, even if AGO went into run-off, it would continue to earn premiums over time. The duration of the insurance is about 14 years and that may trend longer because the deals written over the past three years are less likely to be refinanced. The company provides visibility into premium and losses recognition over the next 20 years in the 2010 10-K, starting on p.189.
To at least get some back of the envelope numbers, let's start with a few basics about the market. There are $3.2 trillion in tax-exempt bonds outstanding of which $1.0 trillion are insured (Source: http://www.sifma.org/research/item.aspx?id=23188 ). Long-term, around 1/3 of tax-exempts are insured. On a yearly basis, insurance penetration peaked at 57% in 2005 and clearly shows that impact of under-pricing the risk. Going forward, there will continue to be demand for bond insurance. These smaller issues rely on an insurance rating more to attract buyers, while making interest rates reasonable for issuers. US municipal bond issuance has averaged $330 billion over the past 15 years (Source: http://www.sifma.org/research/statistics.aspx ). If AGO captured 15% of that, it would represent $50 billion in bonds wrapped. The upfront premium is, very roughly, 1% of the total issue. Thus, AGO could write $500 million of new premium per year. While that won't translate into significant earned premium in the first year, a series of similar years will accumulate.
Financial guaranty is like the oil business. The assets have a limited life expectancy and new assets have to be continuously acquired to replace the existing ones. The key difference is that AGO gets all the cash up front and most of it is placed in UPR and in the investment portfolio. The balance sheet represents a better picture of the economic value of AGO than the income statement.
Valuation - Book value was $20.65 (82%) and adjusted book value was $48.98 (35%) as of 12/31/2010. AGO calculates adjusted book value to include the present value of new premiums, referred to as PVP. By comparison, MBIA trades at 69% of BV and 26% of ABV. I suspect that MBI will trade up when the Article 78 suit is dismissed, and it is obvious that AGO is financially stronger than MBI.
Book value is understated due to the FSA deal. Since AGO paid under 40% of equity for the business, there was $1.7 billion of negative goodwill generated. Normally, this would be run through the income statement as a gain all at once but, instead, they had to increase UPR (thus, it is in ABV) and amortize it over time.
BV and ABV are understated by $3.30/sh because of VIE consolidation. The VIE's represent $607 million of net liability on the balance sheet by virtue of AGO exercising their contractual rights but there is no actual recourse. It is an accounting quirk that FASB has yet to address.
Competition - Before the financial crisis, there were seven financial guaranty insurers. Now there is AGO and MBI. You will probably note that most of the competition now is not with other financial guarantors but with other means of credit enhancement. On a deal basis, AGO insured 14% of all tax-exempt deals, equating to 8.4% on a par basis, implying that they handled many small deals. That does not include BAB's because they are not tax-exempt. With BAB's not being renewed, AGO will likely gain market share in 2011.
Upside - If you have read this far, now is the time to talk dirty. On the surface, there is not one main catalyst but a series of them: 
S&P Ratings Proposal - Whatever is decided, AGO and the market will have clarity for once on rating requirements.
Settlements with the banks - obviously based on today's news
Monopoly/Duopoly - Pricing and market share will be more rational.
Structured Finance Portfolio - As this shrinks, it frees up capital because public finance has lower capital requirements. It also frees up cash, as they unwind RMBS credit derivatives that have required posting of margin. The BofA settlement includes reinsurance that will free up more capital.
Buybacks - AGO is authorized to buy back up to 2 million shares. This is on hold until their capital requirements are known. When looking at buybacks from an adjusted book value basis, this would be hugely accretive, even if they went into run-off.
Outcomes
1. Base Case - AGO goes into run-off because the S&P goes through with the proposed UPR exclusion and lower leverage tests.
2. Likely Case - The S&P recants the UPR proposal but keeps the lower leverage test. AGO will probably need to raise a small level of capital. According to AGO, they should be rated AAA, if this is the case; however, the S&P currently has them rated AA+. The S&P has enough egg already on its face, so they will engineer a way to justify last fall's downgrade of AGO. Given the
3. Best Case - Minimal impact from the S&P proposal, they get AAA rating back and it is off to the races.
Risks:
- The S&P proposal requires a capital raise
- Fewer public bond deals

  Investment Opportunity
  Transcontinental (TSX.TCL-A) presents the opportunity to invest in a family controlled business going through structural transformation. As noted in the previous write up by andreas947, TC was predominantly a printer in Canada that has made significant strides toward diversification in the packaging sector. Although we expect the printing business to continue to decline and acknowledge the 2x net leverage, our forecasts and financial stress testing point to TC being an attractive risk reward for value investors. TC generated a 21% FCF yield (adjusting out the benefit of working capital) in 2019. Taking a conservative view on the next few years, we believe TC will have a 2021 FCF yield of 16%. At that point we’d be left with a strong and growing niche packaging business, a smaller and declining print business but a company with overall profitability growth – a combination that we think will be worth closer to a 12% FCF yield or $23 stock. There are a few paths for even higher estimates.
  Business History
  Transcontinental is headquartered in Montreal, Quebec and was founded as a flyer printing business in 1976 by Rémi Marcoux, the family’s patriarch. Over time, TCL grew to be Canada’s largest printing company and magazine publisher. Rémi Marcoux made strategic acquisitions to bolster TC's competitive advantage in Canada. In 2012, Rémi stepped down as Chair of the Board and was succeeded by his daughter, Isabelle Marcoux.
  In 2014, TC made its initial foray into flexible packaging in a strategic decision to diversify away from a declining print and advertising business and transition into packaging which offered a promising new area for growth. TCL continued to divest small pockets of non-core assets to focus its strategic execution and finally arrived as a major packaging player in April 2018 with the leveraged acquisition of Coveris Americas for $1.8b CAD. At the time of the Coveris acquisition announcement TC stock was trading near $32 at the time of acquisition and it has since fallen to below $16.
  The Marcoux family owns a 14.5% economic and a 71% voting stake in the company through B shares. Additionally, CEO Francois Olivier is a son-in-law of TC’s founder. While both factors would typically raise investors’ eyebrows, we believe they are actually positives for the company. The family is conservative and prudent with capital allocation (although not without missteps) and Francois has done a great job managing a declining business and so far operating a new segment, packaging. We concur with our primary research that described the family as lucky to have Francois leading the business.
  What is Different Over the Last 18 Months?
  The market responded poorly to TC overpaying for Coveris (the purchase price is the capital allocation misstep we mentioned) and the first few quarters after the acquisition performance were less than stellar. However, more recently, we’ve seen a material acceleration of margin expansion in packaging which we think will continue. Organic growth in packaging has been challenged, but we believe 1H 2020 will be a bottom for growth as the company has made progress on new sales efforts to fill excess capacity. Additionally, TC is staying focused – they just
announced the sale of its paper packaging business for $240m, which represents about a 10x EBITDA multiple, helping to reach their leverage target goals a year early. Compared to 18 months ago, we see more synergies ahead, a better business mix with high margins and lower leverage. With packaging
finally on firm footing, we believe the headlines surrounding the printing business are weighing on TC shares.
  Printing Business
  Andreas947 did a great job of explaining the printing business and its segments so we defer to his write-up on this front. One of the biggest questions for TCL is how fast the printing business will decline.
  This segment has very high customer concentration – the top 5 customers comprise about80% of the revenues on the printing side so losing a customer would be painful. We don’t know for sure who is on the top 5 list, but our impression is that the largest customers are Shoppers Drug Mart, Jean Coutu, Sobeys, Walmart, Canadian Tire, Loblaws, Home Depot and Lowe’s.
  There are a couple headwinds in this business. The first involves digital flyers taking share from print flyers. We’ve spoken to people managing both digital and print flyer orders and it is a little hard to estimate how quickly print flyers will decline. The advantages of digital flyers are that they offer more targeted opportunities will the ability to more accurately measure the effectiveness of your ads. Still, Canadian consumers have been conditioned to check for physical flyers for coupons before making routine purchases at the hardware store, pharmacy, or grocery stores. Many of our industry calls pointed to this conditioning as a reason for retailers to be careful when weaning customers from print to digital. Of course, we expect print flyers will decline, and to deal with the uncertainty we build in heavier declines than we would normally expect. Even with what we believe to be bearish forecasts, TCL still appears to offer an attractive opportunity.
  Over the past few quarters, the company talked about somewhere between 1 and 3 print customers that began testing dark weeks. This resulted in those retailers moving from weekly to bi-monthly flyering. This had a material impact on profits in 2019. Our understanding is that printing fewer pages consistently isn’t a huge margin problem for the company, but the on/off nature of dark weeks was challenging. Much of this has been resolved as we head into 2020 – the company claims 2 customers have returned to normal weekly output (although perhaps with fewer pages). We expect print pages to decline, but are encouraged by these retailers moving back into a normal schedule, which also meshes with the thesis that Canadian retailers will only move away from print slowly. TC has done a great job of maintaining margins on its business by closing facilities as sales have declined. The company already has a plan in place to close certain facilities if the printing volumes continue to decline.
  The largest overhang in printing is due to Publisac, a weekly bag that is delivered to homes in Quebec with coupons from TC’s customers. The City of Montreal is in the process of considering to make the Publisac an opt-in delivery method versus an opt-out. Last week, the local environmental committee recommended to make it an opt-in procedure and there is still uncertainty around this. While we believe it is possible Publisac will be forced to go opt-in in Montreal, the market appears to be pricing in the larger risk; the wider province of Quebec will follow Montreal. Our estimates (below) factor in the complete loss of Publisac in Montreal, as well as an allocation for Montreal flyer printer (despite there being other distribution outlets). This whole policy process will still take years to unfold and while it may provide somewhat of an overhang, it is likely the company will continue seeing cash flows from this business for the next few years.
  Packaging Business
  The packaging business was fully built out after the 2018 acquisition of Coveris Americas. TC has significant assets in flexible packaging and some interesting niche products like shrink and forming films. We believe TC has excess capacity but has struggled to grow organically. While we have no evidence yet, the company seems to be calling 1H 2020 as the bottom for organic growth. We aren’t baking in growth to our forecasts but believe this is a reasonable area of upside. We are more optimistic on margins. Pro-forma for the recently announced sale of paper packaging, the company had 13.8% EBITDA margins in Q4 2019. They are targeting 15% EBITDA margins by 2021 which seems achievable based on realizing synergies and a bit of cost realignment. Considering the success this team has achieved by growing margins over the past few years and their long time success on the print side, we expect them achieve their 15% target. We suspect that sometime next year the company will rollout a new margin target, likely closer to 16% or 17% (although with a later target date). We’ve spoken with a few industry experts and former employees to learn about TC’s assets and general packaging environment. We were encouraged to hear that TC has some high quality assets, including some facilities that Coveris had upgraded right before the transaction. We did hear that overall supply demand remains imbalanced with excess supply, but also that the kind of packaging TC manufacturers tends to be relatively sticky. This may partially explain why organic growth has been weak.
While not in our numbers, we suspect TC will make another acquisition in packaging, likely a bolt-on to accelerate growth. A further acquisition will likely drive packaging profits well ahead of print, transforming the company ahead of our timeline.
  Valuation
  Our model assumes that packaging will have no growth going forward,but can achieve the targeted 15% EBITDA margin. On print, we assume a 7.5% organic decline. Since we are less certain about the fate of the Publisac situation, we conservatively assume that TC immediately loses all of their Publisac distribution revenue as well as their printing revenue in the city of Quebec. Realistically, the Publisac will not disappear immediately in a worst case scenario, not all of the printing revenue would be impacted, and some of the lost Publisac revenue may be distributed through new channels. Still, even with these draconian assumptions with respect to Publisac, TC presents 47% upside over 2 years. We do assume the company continues to close printing facilities, allowing for some margin recapture.

  Risks
  We believe the biggest risk to TC is if a large customer stops printing physical flyers with TCL. But since consumers are so conditioned to use the flyers to shop, we think printed flyers still represent an important channel to market to consumers. Certain customers have been experimenting with “dark weeks” in certain areas to measure the value of printed flyers but we’ve been told that after each dark week, TCL’s customers have always returned. The print flyers
business represents ~40% of printing revenues.
  It would hurt TC if the City of Montreal requires Publisac customers to opt-in to the Publisac in order to receive the flyers. But Montreal Publisac only represents single digit percent of printing revenues and this would only apply to the city of Montreal. A bigger risk is that this decision spills over to other
jurisdictions which may impact TCL materially but over a many year time horizon since the policy process is slow.
  An economic recession in Canada would obviously harm both the printing and packaging businesses.
  Management has indicated an appetite for smaller non-transformational acquisitions which concerns us a little since they overpaid for Coveris. But this concern is somewhat tempered by the fact that the family prioritizing maintaining a healthy balance sheet at 2x leverage.
  Conclusions
  Although TC overpaid for Coveris Americas, we think the decision made strategic sense in order to diversify away from printing. The stock has already been punished for the high price the company paid and it seems like now is a good opportunity to invest in the company. TCL seems focused on the right things right now like executing on packaging operations, pulling out the synergies, and managing the cost structure of the printing business. The risks around Publisac seem well established and overplayed considering the likely timeline until a final decision is implemented.
  We find the FCF yield to be very attractive relative to our forecasts which expect the printing business to decline at 7.5% per year and for the packaging business to remain flat. The TCL Media business/Other segment is much smaller and we haven’t focused on it so we’re expecting it to be flat.
  Even though the printing business is facing declines, we believe it will be partially offset by reducing the print facility footprint. The company is attractive on a levered FCF basis, but also on an unlevered basis. They should be able to deleverage which will unlock value as debt is converted to equity.
  I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

This stock very thinly, so this is a PA idea only, but it is possible to build up a six figure position with some patience.
ITEX is a Bellevue, WA based small-business barter exchange.  Stock price $4.40, 1.6 million FDS, $7.0 million market cap, $5.7 million net cash, $1.3 million EV.  TTM net income is $861k and FCF is $1.4 million.  The company pays a $0.20 annual dividend and has done a major tender offer every 3 years or so going back a decade, the last one being at $4.25/share for $1.9m or 19% of shares outstanding in 2019.  Fiscal year ends 7/31/2021.  Gross cash is about a $1 million higher than current assets less current liabilities, that is somewhat balanced out by a $585k deferred tax asset that is still burning off from the dot.com era.
ITEX has been written up on VIC 3 times, in 2008 at $0.92/share , 2012 at $4.06/share, and 2015 at $3.05/share.  The story has not materially changed.  Since 2012, the company has paid $2/share in dividends and sharecount has shrunk from 3.3 million shares to 1.5 million shares via share repurchases/tender offers.  The stock currently trades at 0.3x EV/revenue and 1.9x EV/EBIT.
The business has been shrinking steadily for the last 20 years, and revenue is down from $16 million in 2011 to 7 million TTM.  The company has managed that decline very well, with EBIT margins actually increasing over that period from 7% to 16%,, and the company has produced over $1.2 million FCF ever year for the last decade.  I am not going to go into the details of the appeal of the barter business.  The 3 prior writeups cover it well and there are numerous articles online about ITEX and its main competitors International Monetary Systems (which trades on pink sheets), as well as details on the company websites.  The important facts are that that the business is run via a franchise network, the franchisees are independent business owners who own a geographic area with local customers, and barter appears to have an appeal to a certain end-customer base.  It’s a weird little niche that has been around a long time.  I think it’s likely the business will continue to decline slowly and pump out a ton of cash.
Steven White is the Chairman and President and stepped down in May as CEO.  He owns 31.7% of the company.   White took control in 2003 after a proxy fight and has seen his relative stake in the company almost 4x via the share repurchases over time.  He has run the company very well and in a shareholder friendly manner.  The new CEO, Robert Benson, was a longtime VP at ITEX.
The Lion Fund (Sardar Biglari’s fund that is entwined with Biglari Holdings) owns 21.4%.  Biglari acquired the stake in a 2008 exchange offer for Western Sizzlin’ at $0.93/share where he tried to take over the company.
This is a very simple investment – it’s a well run, shareholder friendly company that pays a 4.5% dividend, trades at 1.9x EV/EBIT, and maybe you wake up one day and get a nice pop in a sale.  You also may get a chance to exit via a tender at some point soon.  As I mentioned, the company has done 3 in the last decade and cash has now built up to the highest point in that period.
I think it’s unlikely that you lose money at this price.
I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.

Virtualodin wrote the name in November 2017, and I obviously agree with him. His write-up was excellent.
--------------------------------------------------
Banks that control a large share of a local deposit base are usually great businesses. These companies have a cost advantage, as they can finance a large pool of assets with low cost deposits and dilute administrative costs over a larger base. In the end, these market leaders are able to earn higher returns assuming the same level of balance sheet risk as competitors. Here are some banks with significant market share, and as shown, shareholders have done very well.
These banks would wish to have the dominance Lloyds enjoys. Lloyds is the largest bank, by a wide margin, in the UK with ~30% market share in deposits and mortgages.
It is very difficult to find banks with such dominance, much less in a developed market such as the UK. For this reason, we expect Lloyds to achieve top-class profitability.
We expect Lloyd´s will earn £0.08 per share in less than 2 years. Given the market dominance, the simple and profitable business model (mortgage and consumer lending) and conservative culture, we believe this franchise deserves at least a market multiple. For these reasons, the stock might double over the next 2 years.
A brief overview on how come Lloyds got to be so dominant? How regulators let this happen?
During the boom years in the mid-2000s, when competitors such as RBS and HBOS were “printing” money and expanding, Lloyds stuck to its boring business. The bank kept lending money the traditional way and intentionally didn´t enter the business of lending in sub-prime and structuring mortgage backed securities. At the time, the aggressiveness of that business model looked attractive, but the prudence of Lloyds paid off.
When the crisis brought RBS, HBOS, Northern Rock, etc. to its knees, Lloyds was in a position of strength. Years before the crisis, regulators had kept Lloyds from acquiring other banks because of its large market share. But in 2008, it was the only option the BOE really had. They didn´t want another Northern Rock-like run on the bank and HBOS was clearly going in that direction. HBOS depended on whole-sale funding and that dried up quickly, also the bank had a large amount of exposure to troubled sub-prime mortgages and commercial loans.
Late in 2008, after significant pressure from the BOE and politicians, Lloyds acquired HBOS. Lloyds got what it wanted and once again increased its share of the local UK market.
Unfortunately, HBOS proved to be a terrible acquisition which ended costing Lloyds shareholders dearly. HBOS had much more troubled loans than originally expected. This forced Lloyds to raise capital, diluting shareholders in the process. The Government ended up owning 43% of Lloyds after capitalizing the bank, in a series of controversial events. While this resulted in losses for shareholders, it also has left the Bank in an enviable position of total dominance in its local market.
What is Lloyds now?
Lloyds is a traditional bank with 95% of its assets based in the UK. It is primarily focused on lending money to households (mortgages, auto and credit cards). The bank also serves businesses with commercial loans and other corporate services. The bank has very little exposure to investment banking, international finance or other “complicated” business lines. Lloyds is a traditional and simple bank that makes most of its money lending the “old-fashioned” way.
The business is divided into three segments: 1) Retail, 2) Commercial and 3) Insurance and Wealth Management.
Retail: This segment offers mortgages, credit cards, auto loans, and certain unsecured loans through its +2,100 branches and digital channels. The Retail operation has £250bn in deposits and £340bn in earning assets. Of these assets, 86% are mortgages, 5% credit cards (last year the company acquired MBNA to gain share in this segment) and 4% auto loans. The mortgage portfolio is very healthy with LTVs of 43% compared to +55% less than 10 years ago. Also, only ~10% of the mortgages have LTV >80%. This is a low risk operation with low expected loss rates and high-quality assets with significant collateral value. In 2017, the Retail segment generated underlying profit of £6bn or 56% of Lloyd´s total profits.
Commercial: This segment offers services to SMEs, Global Corporates and Financial institutions. Most of these clients are UK based or have links to the UK. Services include lending, transactional banking and working capital management. The Commercial operation has £150bn in deposits and £100bn in earning assets. In 2017, the Commercial segment generated underlying profit of £2.5bn or 32% of Lloyd´s total profits.
Insurance and Wealth Management: This segment offers annuity payments, home insurance, pension services and wealth management. In 2017, the Insurance and Wealth Management segment generated underlying profit or 0.9bn or 12% of Lloyd´s total profits.
Why is Lloyd´s special?
A question that immediately pops up is, why invest in Lloyds over the large US banks, which have been doing well for some time now. Besides being cheaper and easier to understand (a simpler business and balance sheet), Lloyds is a much more dominant bank in its market. JP Morgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America, each have roughly a 10% share of the local US deposit market. In the UK, Lloyd´s share represents these three combined. 
Lloyds is a dominant franchise that customers trust. Anecdotally, after the turbulent moments of Brexit the bank experienced a large inflow of deposits. As a market leader, it is able to finance the largest UK loan book with a large base of low cost deposits. This is very important in a developed and competitive market such as the UK where yields are pressured. This large low-cost deposit base has helped the bank reach a NIM of 2.9%, which is very decent in this environment, taking into account the low level of risk and quality of the company´s assets. The bank also has the lowest cost/income ratio in the UK, largely due to its scale, as it is able to share costs over a larger base, and management’s push to reduce costs. Currently, Lloyds ratio is 47% compared to ~60% for its local peers and 56% for the efficiency leader of the large US banks, JP Morgan. Lloyds also expects to reach low 40s by 2020 as the bank keeps cutting costs and reducing the branch footprint. These advantages will be accentuated as banks transition into a digital world. Large banks have been investing and will be able to invest more in the digital platforms, while smaller competitors have fewer resources to make these large, fixed investments. For this reason, we expect the cost advantage to widen over time. 5 years ago, Lloyds was able meet only 30% of customer needs via digital, and now it has reached 70%. The bank has more than 13 million digital active users. Over time, the large branch fottprint will decline, as customer needs are met digitally, and the cost base will decline. 
These 2 advantages, large and low-cost deposit funding and scale that permits the lowest cost/income ratio, will be the major reason why Lloyds will reach top class profitability. Also, these advantages let Lloyds focus on low risk and boring areas such as mortgage lending, instead of going after higher yielding but riskier lending activities.
Why invest now?
A series of events have pressured the results and share price. This has opened an opportunity for investors.
PPI: This is a type of credit insurance that protects in case of a fatality, illness or other events. For years, many banks in the UK sold these products to its clients. In many cases the PPI was sold without customer knowledge, at high rates and the product was inefficient in protecting the client’s interests. In 2011, Lloyds started taking provisions for future claims. In the past 7 years, the bank has paid almost £20bn in claims. This has hit profitability and capital. In 2017, the bank took a provision of £1.7bn and the unused balance sheet allowance stands at £2.4bn. This chapter should reach an end in August 2019, as the FCA has set a deadline for claims.
Brexit: This is an obvious risk that had an immediate impact on the share price. Investors hate volatility and well this was a major event. Brexit had a minor impact on results as lower rates compressed the yields on its loans. This has been solved with repricing of the deposit base and NIMs are now even higher than in 2016. Also, the BOE raised rates for the first time in a decade 6 months ago. There is also a risk that this will have a large impact on the UK economy and that NPLs will rise. While this is a possibility, the loan book of Lloyds is of extremely high quality and there has been no impact on loss rates so far. The final outcome of Brexit is to be determined, but Lloyds has a high-quality loan book that would be able to stand difficult economic times.
Government Ownership: During the crisis, the BOE became the largest Lloyd´s shareholder at 43%. The Government sold off its last shares in 2017. This episode of ownership and then prolonged divestment has put pressure on the stock price.
European banks: It is a fact that US banks took their medicine via charge offs and capital injections, while most European banks just delayed the inevitable. Having said that, UK was a special place where the Government took a radical stance and took large stakes in major banks. These banks got capitalized and there was a process of getting rid of the bad assets. Lloyds currently has a CET1 ratio of 14% compared to 7% in 2010. Also, the bank impaired loans have been reduced to 1.6%, from 10% in 2010. Risk weighted assets have also been reduced by more than £150bn, increasing the strength on the balance sheet. The bank has very little exposure outside the UK and there are no major exposures to peripheral countries. Some investors put Lloyds in the same pile as many of its European peers but the reality is that Lloyds took its medicine, 95% of the balance sheet is in UK based assets and there are not many similarities to the global European banks.
Household debt: The Lloyds loan book is composed mostly of UK mortgages. Investing in Lloyds is partly a bet that households will keep paying their debts. UK household debt is very high when compared to other regions of the world, and this is an area of concern. Since the crisis, UK households have been in a deleveraging process which has improved the leverage ratios. As home prices have risen LTV ratios have also been improving significantly, bringing more protection to lenders. It´s also important to note that default rates in the UK have been quite low compared to other countries. This might be mostly due to the fact that mortgages are full recourse in the UK, meaning that lenders have access to other assets in case of default. In the US, for example, the only asset banks can reach once a default occurs is the house. 
Valuation
The bank is currently trading as if non-recurring costs will remain at current levels for eternity and Brexit will impact NPLs and NIMs significantly.
In 2017, the bank generated adjusted earnings of £6bn, or .08 pence per share. Lloyds is trading at 7.5x adjusted earnings and 1.2x TBV.
Unfortunately, the bank had to pay £1.7bn in PPI provisions and £0.9bn in other conduct provisions. Eventually, most of these charges should go away. The Government has imposed a cutoff for PPI in August 2019, so that will leave a cleaner picture. 
After all these exceptional charges, the bank earned £3.5bn, or 0.05 pence per share. So even if we assume these charges will be here forever, one way or another, the bank is trading at 12.5x.
We believe the bank will close the gap between adjusted and statutory profits over time. This will lead to higher earnings which combined with cost initiatives and possible higher rates, will cause earnings to increase significantly. 
In the past, the market has agreed that this is a great business (Lloyds even traded at 7x BV and in the decade before the crisis, never traded under 2x BV) . Let´s hope the market changes its view of Lloyds once again. 
  We believe that as non-recurring costs decline and underlying performance improves, Lloyds will become a simple yet highly profitable bank. Eventually, the market should reward good results.

Intro
We are long shares of Huya, a rapidly growing Chinese live streaming platform focused on gaming and e-sports operating in a duopoly with DouYu (also publicly traded under DOYU). In 2014, Amazon acquired Twitch for nearly $1 billion. At the time of acquisition, Twitch was rumored to have 50 million MAU with minimal revenue. Today, Huya is valued at $2.8 billion with nearly 150 million MAU in the largest gaming market globally with over 680 million gamers that is estimated to grow to ~900 million in 2023. Huya will generate ~$1.2 billion of revenue in 2019, implying a very undemanding revenue multiple of 2.3x (1.7x for 2020). Amazon’s acquisition of Twitch put a spotlight on an emerging trend of video games becoming a spectator sport. In China, where Twitch is banned, the game live streaming industry generated $2 billion of revenue in 2018 and there’s a long runway for growth given the size of the Chinese gaming market. The growing popularity of e-sports should also provide a strong tailwind as Huya is involved in broadcasting some of the world’s most popular tournaments (sometimes exclusively). Huya broadcasted over 110 e-sports tournaments in Q3, drawing more than 560 million viewers. Huya invests heavily in e-sports to draw users to its platform and convert them to active viewers. The average mobile viewer on Huya is extremely engaged, typically spending more than 100 minutes a day consuming content from over 700k streamers.
  Shares have been under heavy pressure as the fast-growing sector has drawn the attention from other Chinese internet companies, particularly Kuaishou, the second largest short video platform in China behind TikTok. Kuaishou entered the game live-streaming space in the second half of this year, creating headline pressure for Huya shares. However, Kuaishou has not impacted performance. Huya posted very strong numbers for Q3 with revenue growing 77% y-o-y. Our data vendors indicate that top-line metrics for Q4 also look very strong. So while news around Kuaishou draws attention and investor concern, shares have sold off too much and represent an attractive opportunity.

  Leading Platform within Consolidating Industry
Huya and DouYu are the leading platforms for game live streaming and both are positioned to benefit as the industry has been consolidating (note that both are backed by Tencent). Panda, the industry’s third largest player, exited the market earlier this year. Despite this dynamic, investors are concerned about Kuaishou entering the space. At least in the short-term, the concerns are overblown as we’ve seen no impact on Huya’s performance. Also, the game live streaming business model (inherited from Huya’s parent YY) operates within an ecosystem where talent agencies play a critical role as the intermediary between a live streaming platform and streamers/professional gamers. Huya has relationships with over 24,000 talent agencies, 1,500 of which are considered “platinum” that manage over 200k streamers. These relationships are critical as many of these top streamers are professionally managed by these agencies. Our work indicates that as of now, Kuaishou does not have the same level of relationships with these agencies.

  Top streamers are also locked into contracts that can be as long as 3-5 years. In the live streaming space, top streamers attract the most fans and therefore, most of the live streaming revenue is generated by these popular streamers. Without access to these streamers, it would be difficult for Kuaishou to monetize their userbase at the same level as Huya. 
  Overall, Kuaishou’s foray into game live streaming isn’t something to completely dismiss, but for now Huya still holds the advantage as a gaming-centric platform. Kuaishou is also backed by Tencent and it’s hard to imagine that Tencent would want a third player to be in this space. Kuaishou’s latest funding round by Tencent will likely be focused on their core short video platform as they battle against TikTok.
  Rapid Growth and Improving Profitability
The Chinese game live streaming market is large and estimated to grow from $2 billion in 2018 to over $5 billion in 2023 as gaming is likely in a very long secular growth period. The market is big enough for both Huya and DouYu to continue to grow for a long time. Top-line metrics for Huya have grown steadily with total MAU, mobile MAU and revenue per user all growing every quarter.

*Paying Ratio = Revenue / paying users (in RMB).
  In addition to the strong growth, Huya’s margin profile has been on an upward trend. Gross margins were 12% in 2017, 16% in 2018 and 18% in the latest quarter, driven almost entirely by optimizing bandwidth costs as the business has grown. There is room for gross margins to improve as the industry consolidates towards Huya and DouYu and pricing for top streamers rationalize. The single biggest expense line for Huya is for content costs (paying streamers and for e-sports tournaments). Huya and DouYu compete for the most popular streamers and many of these contracts are structured with upfront one-time bonuses. As competition between the platforms was intense, platforms like Huya spent a lot of money to draw the best streamers to its platform. Often, streamers would renege on their contracts and terminate early to get better economics with a competing platform. However, with the industry basically down to just Huya and DouYu (again both backed by Tencent), there should be more rationale pricing, especially as Tencent is regulating its own users. Tencent released a guide to all of its gaming users earlier this year. One of the standout rules addressed the issue of streamers ending their contracts early. Anecdotally, we’ve also heard that the platforms are structuring the contracts to be more long-term in nature (3-5 years vs. 1-2 years) so that there is less frequency of upfront bonuses. 
  Huya has already been benefiting from these industry dynamics and streamer cost margins have been improving but are being masked by the company’s heavy investments in e-sports (expense line within COGS combine streamer costs and investments in e-sports). E-sports is a great funnel for user acquisition; however, the initial monetization of these users is much lower. Over the long-term though, Huya’s strategy to leverage e-sports to grow its user base should be successful and potentially lead to other revenue streams like advertising, which today accounts for a very small % of revenue.
  Another key strategy for Huya to improve margins has been to provide non-gaming content. While gaming accounts for 70-80% of Huya’s streaming hours, revenue from non-gaming content now accounts for 40-45% of total revenue. Content from non-gaming (similar to YY Live and Momo) monetizes better and has better ARPU. Huya has also been successful in some niche areas like anime and comics, encroaching on the turf of Bilibili which specializes in that area.  
  Putting all this together can create potential for Huya to generate at least 25% gross margins (about 700 bps improvement from today) in the medium term. Over the long-term, the potential could be higher as Huya is exploring other revenue streams like advertising and game publishing. Huya is potentially looking to expand upmarket by publishing games directly and in September, it published Control in SE Asia, HK and Taiwan. Huya also has an international business called Nimo TV which operates in emerging markets like Brazil, Argentina and Southeast Asia. Nimo is expected to reach 20 million MAU by the end of the year. This international business could also provide long-term optionality.
  Tencent Option
An overhang on the stock is Tencent’s call option to buy more shares, which becomes active in March. Between March 8, 2020 and March 8, 2021, Tencent has the right to purchase shares to bring their voting power up to 50.1% (currently at 40%). They can do this by either: (1) having Huya issue shares or (2) buying directly from YY. Given how beat up the stock is, Tencent probably wouldn't force Huya to issue shares at a near 52-week low. However, in the event that Tencent decides to have Huya issue more shares, the dilution would be 12% (33.8 new class B shares would bring Tencent voting power to 50.1%). Keep in mind though that Tencent could use a combination of both options so the maximum dilution would be 12%. Even if Tencent decides to take control, the closer alignment of interests would actually benefit Huya.

  Valuation and Conclusion
Huya is among the cheapest Chinese internet stocks on an EV/Revenue vs. revenue growth basis. Huya trades at 1.7x 2020 revenue and 1.4x 2021 revenue, which is very attractive given the growth. While applying an EV/Revenue multiple isn’t the perfect way to value a business, arguing for a 3.0x multiple for Huya is reasonable relative to other Chinese internet stocks. At 3.0x 2020 revenue, Huya would be worth ~$26/share, about 50% higher than today’s levels. Most sell-side analysts model adj. EPS of $0.80 in 2020 and $1.16 in 2021, implying P/E (ex-cash) multiples of 26x for 2020 and 18x for 2021. Given the growth profile and leading market position, these are reasonable multiples in this environment.
Source: CapitalIQ and Kerrisdale estimates.
  Overall, the market has overreacted to Kuaishou’s entrance into the market. The ecosystem for live streaming is not easy to replicate and management, benefiting from their long-time experience at YY, continues to make Huya the best platform to watch professional e-sports and for top streamers to broadcast. As sentiment for Chinese tech stocks can change quickly, it could take just one or two quarters of solid fundamentals to allay investor concerns for the stock to work from here.

INVESTMENT SUMMARY:
Matson, Inc. (“MATX”) is one of the premiere US ocean transportation carriers in the Pacific. ~75% of MATX’s business consists of a duopoly in the Hawaii trade route, a “temporary” monopoly in the Guam trade route and a very profitable niche Transpacific route from China to California.  HI and Guam are both protected and regulated by the Jones Act, which gives them both a natural moat.  MATX also owns the 9th largest asset-lite freight brokerage in the US, where it provides rail intermodal, highway brokerage and warehousing.  Although MATX was founded in 1882, it only recently began to trade independently.  On 12/1/2011, Alexander & Baldwin (A&B) announced it would split into two companies, MATX and A&B, a Hawaii-based land company with interests in real estate development, commercial real estate and agriculture (sugar).  The separation was recently completed in 6/29/12.  During the transition, MATX also gained a new CFO, who was formerly the CFO at Alexander & Baldwin and a Goldman Sachs banker before that.
  Based on where MATX has traded post-separation, it is clear that many investors might have preferred the A&B real-estate asset and, subsequently, liquidated its MATX shares.  It is also possible that MATX has simply traded down with other international containership peers due to concerns over supply/demand balance and the global macro environment.  However, this seems to be unjustified given that 1) only ~13% of MATX’s Ocean Transportation revenue is exposed to international rates and 2) the Jones Act provides invaluable protection/competitive positioning for MATX that other international containership companies do not possess.  Furthermore, while MATX seems to be trading in-line with other Jones Act equities, there are several areas poised to potentially expand top-line and margins: 1) core Hawaii end market volume could be at an inflection point based on current leading economic / construction indicators, 2) MATX’s new monopoly and military expansion in Guam and niche (premium-ization of cargo) China lines provide secular price and volume opportunities, and 3) financial distress of a key Jones Act competitor may open an opportunity in another trade lane (Alaska).  At current prices, we believe the risk/reward in MATX is extremely attractive with downside to ~$20 based on a conservative asset/liquidation value (not to mention a ~3% dividend yield) and upside to $30 over the next 12 months.  MATX is currently poorly covered by analysts who all underestimate a turn in volumes and a recovery in margins. 
  Given that Hawaii container and automobile volumes are at their lowest point in a decade and overall corporate margins are depressed, we see two main risks to the investment.  If the Jones Act were ever repealed or modified, it would have a devastating impact on the outlook and earnings power for MATX and other publicly traded Jones Act companies.  We believe that the chances of this happening are remote, but the risk clearly exists.  The other uncertainty surrounding MATX revolves around the potential outcomes relating to the deep financial distress of its chief competitor in HI, Horizon Lines.  While not completely apparent on the surface level, MATX needs HL (or a competitor with its same demeanor) in order to maintain the current competitive balance in the trade lane.  Again, we think this will likely result in a neutral outcome, but the situation is still opaque.
    INVESTMENT THESIS:
  Well Positioned for a Recovery in the Real-Estate Market and a Beneficiary of Hawaii's Largest Rail Project Ever:  The Hawaii trade route counts for ~75% of MATX’s Ocean Transportation revenue and over 50% of its overall sales. MATX has a 2/3s market share of the shipping volume from the US to Hawaii - it is the state’s lifeline. The other player in the duopoly, Horizon Lines, has been in deep financial distress (as a result of several leveraged buy-outs) but has still acted rationale, which has led to a stable pricing environment.  Pricing upside exists, but will continue to be somewhat limited by regulatory authorities and MATX is comfortable with its current share. Thus, revenue growth in this trade route will primarily be driven by overall HI container volumes, which is directly correlated to Hawaiian economic activity. 
  MATX’s container and automobile volumes are currently at their lowest in over a decade.  Similar to other parts of the United States, volumes declined from their 05-07 peak due to the financial crisis, the major earthquake in Japan and the downtrend in real estate and construction activity. 
  Appendix I: MATX Historical Hawaii Container and Automobile Volumes: https://www.dropbox.com/s/g35t4m4nctltjbp/MATX-WriteUp-AppendixI.pdf
  Container volumes are currently down ~30-40K below their recent peaks and ~2/3s of the decrease (20-25K containers) is due to the continued slowdown in construction activity.  While construction activity should remain muted over the near term, there are signs that the current downward cycle has troughed.  2011 was the 4th best year for tourism in Hawaii on record (5% off 2007 peak of 7.6mm visitors) and the University of Hawaii Research Organization (UHERO) indicates that 2012E should show over a 9% improvement in visitor arrivals.  Despite threatening global economic clouds, the Hawaii tourism sector has continued to post impressive growth, driven by robust income gains in commodity exporting countries, new airline routes from the US and Asia, and success in tapping non-traditional markets.  Additionally, unemployment is currently expected to drop to 5.6% by 2013E, and Hawaii real GDP is expected to turn positive to 1.5% in 2012E after being slightly negative in 2011 and is expected to accelerate to 2.3% in 2013E. 
  Appendix II: Hawaii Economic Indicators Forecast: https://www.dropbox.com/s/8qu96s51qgosc4r/MATX-WriteUp-AppendixII.pdf
  Despite those positive economic indicators, construction activity in Hawaii, the key driver of container volumes, has still lagged, but things are projected to turn around in the next few years.  Building permits in HI, a key leading indicator, are forecasted to grow by 50% in 2012E after declining by -22% in 2011 (to be fair, a significant portion of that statistic is being driven by energy tax credits and solar panels).  Most importantly, management has indicated that one of the best proxies for construction demand is construction payroll jobs.  While construction jobs should continue to be sluggish through 2012E at +0.6%, UHERO expects Hawaii’s construction job count to post several years of strong growth as soon as next year (2013E).  Forecasts of a construction recovery in HI have been postponed in past, but the current UHERO forecasts are currently given little credit in consensus forecasts or MATX’s valuation. 
  Finally, after breaking-ground in 2011, HI’s $5.2bn public transportation rail project was contested as the former governor of HI, Ben Cayetano, came out of retirement to run for mayor of Honolulu with the goal of stopping the rail. He ran against former House Majority leader, Kirk Caldwell, and both were running neck and neck in the polls. However, in the end Caldwell won a decisive victory in early Nov. 2012, which bodes well for the rail project. There are still some federal lawsuits and an archaeological study in progress, but there are folks on both sides that believe they only represent a delay.  The FTA is expected to be signing a grant agreement for $1.55bn for the project in the next several weeks (http://www.kitv.com/news/hawaii/Feds-ready-to-give-Honolulu-30-percent-of-rail-project-s-cost/-/8905354/17481652/-/gcsr3n/-/index.html).  Furthermore, the archaeological study is ahead of schedule and work is expected to now resume earlier than expected in Q213 vs. Q313 (http://www.kitv.com/news/hawaii/Rail-project-s-archeological-survey-ahead-of-schedule/-/8905354/17338386/-/m46do8z/-/index.html).  The rail project would clearly have a positive impact on construction activity over the next several years.
  If HI container volumes were able to get back to pre-real estate bubble levels, it could add as much as $20-$35mm of additional EBITDA.
    Guam / China Provide Significant Opportunity: MATX has recently been able to almost double volumes in Guam after the other player in the duopoly, Horizon Lines, exited the market in late 2011 due to financial distress.  Thus, MATX is now running a monopoly on the Guam trade route.  While MATX has communicated to the market that it expects another competitor to emerge, it is taking actions to postpone this as much as possible.  We believe the two most obvious candidates to replace HL, Maersk and APL, have both looked at the Guam opportunity and passed due to the small size of the market and the distance from their current operations.  With that said, MATX has been very careful about raising rates (it has not done so in Guam yet this year) and providing very timely service in order to make sure that its customers in Guam remain comfortable with the situation.  We believe that this year MATX has been eating extra operating costs to demonstrate its ability to serve the entire trade lane. 
  In addition to the temporary increase in Guam volumes, the entire Guam route is expecting an uptick in volume due to the 2006 agreement that the US would strategically relocate 8K US marines from Okinawa to Guam over 6-10 years. Studies have estimated that the movement of these troops would require a $27bn infrastructure investment in Guam and could increase the 160K population by an additional +59K.  Sell-side analysts have been disappointed that the estimated number of troops has been revised downward to ~5K and that the migration process is still delayed.  However, MATX management seems to be content with this turn of events given the HL situation.  The gradual increase in troops will continue to make splitting the Guam market unattractive to the larger carriers, thus, extending the time that passes before a competitor enters the market. 
  As for the express line from China to Long Beach (CLX-1), management has stated that they continue to expect full utilization despite any moderate changes in demand (has been full for 5 of last 6 years).  MATX’s line is a 10-day express service that is 4-7 days faster than its competitors and, as a result, allows MATX to charge a $200-$500 premium to current shipping rates.  MATX’s smaller ships allow it to unload freight within 24 hours and provide more efficient routes, such as being able to go into the shallow-water port in Shanghai that larger vessels can not.  MATX’s ships also do not “slow steam” like other larger containerships, which gives them better fuel efficiency, but also makes them slower.  MATX believes that its timely express service will allow it to trade up to more premium priced garment shipment fares, as it comes closer to competing with air freight.  In the near term, Transpacific rates have been steadily increasing as the larger players have made efforts to push price and manage capacity.  MATX’s China route is essentially split 50 / 50 between contract and spot rates.  The contracted rates reset annually around May.  Thus, if the contracted rates reset near the forecasted Transpacific rate levels, it could add an incremental ~$2-$4mm of EBITDA in FY 2013, given its high incremental margin.
    Downside is Somewhat Limited Due to Underlying Asset Value: Using industry benchmarks gathered from consultations with several industry players we believe that the replacement cost of the assets is ~$20 per share.  This may be conservative as the cost to build a new Jones Act ship is around $200 million per ship before allowable deductions (as shown below MATX has billion dollar enterprise value with well more than 5 ships, a very attractive JV asset and other assets):
  Appendix III: MATX Salvage Value Analysis: https://www.dropbox.com/s/l08cdqwqv1t3qjh/MATX-WriteUp-AppendixIII.pdf
    Opportunistic Areas for Expansion/M&A Growth:  Adding market share in Hawaii and Guam is always challenging as MATX is extremely conscious of creating a situation that would push the respective governments / customers to push for more competitor(s) or even a repeal/modification of the Jones Act.  Thus, the other avenue for growth beyond a recovery and improvement in their current end markets is expansion into new routes and acquisition.  For instance, management has told investors that the Alaska route could present an opportunity.  Alaska is one of the two of the remaining Jones Act trade routes (the other is Puerto Rico, but they are not interested) and it is currently a duopoly, split 60% / 40% between Totem Ocean Trailer Express and Horizon Lines. Management indirectly stated that the poor financial health of HL could allow MATX to enter the market by purchasing its 3 vessels used in that route.  MATX management went as detailed to say it could enter the market using its surplus ships, but this option would be less desirable given the increased risk of disrupting the market. 
  In terms of acquisition opportunities, most of them would lie on the Logistics side of the business.  M&A has already been a growth component of its Logistics business as MATX made three acquisitions from 2003-08.  Management says it continues to look for small acquisitions (may look to grow its warehousing business).  In Ocean Transportation, MATX may also look for acquisition to bolster its international freight forwarding businesses in China.
    Margin Expansion Opportunity:  Just as MATX’s overall Ocean Transportation volumes are close to a trough, so are its operating margins.  While MATX’s most recent segment operating margins are in the ~7-9% range, management believes that it can achieve a 10-12% operating margin in the long-term.  Based on MATX’s historical performance, this target not only seems reasonable, but it could still be underestimating MATX’s earnings power.  MATX’s operating margins in the Ocean Transportation segment were in-line or even slightly above this range from 2003-2008 and even towards the top of the range in 2010 (a relatively higher equity in earnings from SSAT JV helped somewhat).  Despite higher volumes in all three major trade lines (double in Guam) and higher rates in all three trade lanes, sell-side analysts and, to a lesser extent, we are estimating lower margins in our estimates compared to a much less robust 2010 (even if you remove the positive impact of SSAT in 2010). 
  Similarly, the Logistics segment’s operating margins are at a 10 year low (1-2%) due to the recent loss of a major ocean carrier customer on the Intermodal side and the loss of a full truckload carrier on the Highway side of the business.  Management believes it can improve to a long-term Logistics margin of 2-4%. Improving to the mid-point of the Logistics targeted range is worth $5-$10mm of additional EBITDA.  While the Logistics margins need to be diligence for any structural deterioration in the business, MATX offers an entry point at trough profitability for both segments.
  Even if normalized margins do fall within management’s long-term targets, one can see how much 2013E consensus top-line and margin estimates are still below a Hypothetical Case that assumes 12% Ocean Transportation margins and 3% Logistics margins. A blended Hypothetical Case operating margin is ~9.5%, while 2013E EBIT Margin consensus is currently ~7%.
    Structurally Protected from Regulatory and Business Barriers to Entry:  The Jones Act allows MATX to operate in its duopoly in Hawaii and its monopoly in Guam.  Furthermore, these trade lanes have been historically shared with rationale competitors who have avoided spoiling a market in search of more share.  Thus, the current trough in volumes and their resulting low operating margins are simply a point in the cycle.  This regulatory barrier to entry allows one to wait for the upturn with less risk of a loss in competitive position in the meantime.  Looking into the future, when the cycle gets to a peak, it also reduces the chances of competitors coming in to flood a market. 
    INVESTMENT RISKS:
  If the Jones Act Were Ever to Be Repealed or Meaningful Modified, MATX Would be in Serious Trouble..:  There is no secret that MATX’s business model heavily depends on the Jones Act remaining in its current form.  I would argue that all of MATX’s revenue is directly or indirectly influenced by the Jones Act.  The HI route requires ships to be US-owned, US-crewed, US-built and US-flagged, whereas the Guam route requires them to be US-flagged and US-crewed, but not US-built.  While the China line does not technically benefit from the Jones Act, its economic viability is made possible since it acts as an extension of the HI and Guam routes, which spreads its costs to the latter two.  While it would be very difficult to repeal the Jones Act due to its function in maintaining economic and wartime interests to the US, there is no shortage of its critics. They argue that the Jones Act is simple protectionism that also results in far higher shipping costs of moving cargo between US ports.  On June 25, 2010, Senators John McCain and Jim Risch introduced the Open America's Waters Act, a bill to repeal the Jones Act. Sen.  McCain said the Jones Act restricts shipping and raises costs to consumers in Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico and Guam, but the bill died.  HI’s Senator, Dan Inouye is a big supporter of the Jones Act, but there is some speculation as to what may happen after he leaves his position (Age: 88).
    Planned Ship Additions Over the Next Five Years is a Large Burden on True FCF:  The management team has told its investors that it plans on purchasing 2 more containerships for $200mm each over the next 5 years.  Management has also stated that it would continue to make similar investments every 5 years in order to manage the average age of their fleet, which is in-line with its historical purchasing patterns over the previous decade (MATX purchased 4 containerships between 2003-06).  Furthermore, even if you bullishly assume that the next 2 ships MATX acquires will simply be to increase their fleet size to 11 vs. 9 ships in order to meet increased volume demand (and not to replace current ships), MATX would still need to purchase and simultaneously retire a containership every ~2.5 years in order to maintain the current average age of its fleet (analysis does not include the 3 barges in operation).  That being said, it is clear that the purchases are not absolutely necessary during the timeframe given.  By comparison, HL’s average fleet age is ~35 years compared to MATX’s 19 years, so MATX is clearly taking these actions to provide capacity flexibility and to avoid a similar situation that HL is in right now.  If MATX were hypothetically put into a capitally constrained position for a period of time, it seems like these investments could be postponed.
  Appendix IV: MATX Fleet Age Analysis: https://www.dropbox.com/s/klorbpc4s1wty68/MATX-WriteUp-AppendixIV.pdf
  A cost of $200mm/ship every 2.5 years averages out to ~$80mm of replacement CapEx / year in addition to management’s long-term maintenance CapEx of $40-$50mm / year.  In a hypothetical “normalized” environment where volumes are at average historical levels and margins are within management’s long-term margin guidance (Ocean Transportation: 10-12%, Logistics: 2-4%), operating cash flow is projected to be ~$160mm/year.  Calculating FCF / share with only maintenance CapEx results in a strong $2.67/share and including expansion CapEx, reduces the amount to $1.53/share (assumes tax break from CCF). Furthermore, as a Jones Act company MATX has the ability to contribute earnings before taxes to a Capital Construction Fund. If these funds are withdrawn for investment in vessels and certain related equipment, they do not give rise to a tax liability, but reduce the depreciable bases of the assets for income tax purposes.  If one assumes a 38.5% corporate tax rate and that a vessel is purchased with funds from the CCF, the upfront cost is only $123mm ($200mm x (1-38.5% tax-rate)), or $49mm a year, but its important to note that MATX would have a relatively smaller depreciable base for tax purposes in the future.
    M&A Risk Exists in Both Ocean Transportation and Logistics: While there is always the chance MATX could partake in some type of meaningful M&A transaction on the Ocean Transportation side, the options seem limited to bolt-on acquisitions given the opportunities available.  The bigger threat is the expansion of its Logistics segment given the very fragmented nature of the industry.  MATX is the 9th largest US brokerage, so there are clearly acquisition opportunities to expand.  Given the current relative contributions of the two businesses, it is intuitive that the investor base would be displeased with any transformational acquisitions on the Logistics side of the business.  To be fair though, management has not given any indication so far that they would be looking to make any substantial acquisitions post-separation.
    MATX’s Operating Leverage in its China Trade Lane Offers Some Volatility Due to Transpacific Rates:  While the China line business is not a large top-line contributor (~12% of Ocean Transportation revenue), it does have a meaningful impact on earnings due to its high operating leverage (~90%) as it essentially acts as an add-on to the already existing HI and Guam lines (picks up goods from China for the otherwise empty ride back to the west coast).  At this point, management is confident that the China line can remain at close to 100% utilization due to its small, niche position in the market.  As a result, pricing will drive revenues in the medium-tern.  While its express service is priced at a $200-$500/container premium to other competitors, MATX’s China line is still dependent on the Transpacific market rate.  MATX is in the process of attempting to secularly increase its rates by attracting more premium cargo away from the airline freight carriers, but, in the grande scheme of things, MATX is a price taker and subject to the greater market dynamics and the large carriers operating in the Pacific.  Recently, Transpacific rates have been improving but they depend on a continued rational carrier management of industry capacity.  Based on history, there is no guarantee that this will continue.
    VARIANT VIEW:
  MATX is Subject to the Market Carrier Rates in the Pacific: It is clear that over the last several months, MATX share price has declined along with other international containership carriers over concerns of a global slowdown. However, MATX should be evaluated differently than the others as its end markets are narrower and its Jones Act status creates a much more favorable competitive environment.  As MATX is clearly correlated to the HI / Guam economy, its share price should not be as closely linked to concerns over the global macro economy or international shipping spot rates.  Almost 90% of the sales in its Ocean Transportation segment come from Jones Act trade lanes where it operates as either a monopoly (Guam) or duopoly (Hawaii).  In those two trade lanes, its rates have proven to be consistently steady over time.  Furthermore, while its China line is subject to changes in the Transpacific rate, the line’s demand relies on US demand for goods manufactured in China and generally operates at close to full utilization, so the cyclical swings would not be as dramatic compared to bigger Transpacific containership companies.
    Hawaii Container Volumes Will Be Muted in the “Near Term”: The consensus view is that a construction rebound will fail to occur in 2013 and Hawaii container volumes will be essentially flat, as MATX 2013E consensus revenue growth is only 2%.  However, based on a number of independent 3rd party economic forecasts, there is a solid chance that a construction turnaround in HI could begin in 2013/14 for the reasons listed above, including the positive recent developments relating to the $5.2bn rail project in HI.  Given where consensus is, any of the leading indicators playing out in 2013/14 would result in upside to the shares.
    CapEx Ear-Marked for New Ships are for Replacement Purposes: It seems like most, if not all, sell-side analysts are combing over the public announcement from MATX that it will purchase 2 new vessels over the next 5 years.  Analysts are essentially chalking these capital expenditures up as maintenance, and that MATX will not earn a “return” on these investments.  However, given managements comments that they believe MATX’s volumes are currently at trough levels and the relatively manageable age of their fleet (compared to HL), I believe they are giving themselves the optionality of putting these new vessels into their active fleet.  MATX currently operates 9 active ships in their fleet, but, if one recalls, MATX historically operated with 11 vessels.  In addition to the added volume from Guam (new monopoly and potential for military troops) and Hawaii (increase in container volumes), there could be some other opportunities.  It is possible that MATX could be positioning themselves to take on HL’s Alaska trade route (if they leave it) and there are some that believe a potential end game in Hawaii is HL or a their successor operating with less market share.  Even if these upside scenarios that require the 2 vessels do not materialize, I do not believe these cases are built into MATX’s shares, limiting any downside.
    MATX’s Margin Targets Will Take A Long Time To Achieve: Many analysts believe that MATX’s stated margin goals are optimistic as evidenced by the fact that consensus margin estimates don’t seem to move at all from 2012E to 2013E.  However, we believe that sell-side analysts are under-estimating the inherent incremental margins that will result from higher volumes. 
    VALUATION:
  We have a Target Price for MATX of $30.00 over the next twelve months which equates to 8x our 2013E EBITDA estimate.  One can get to much higher long term prices ($34 - $40/share) based on using a “normalized” set of financial statements or assuming a sum of the parts methodology ascribing an appropriate multiple for the logistics business and the terminal JV at normalized levels.

This will be a very short LONG idea

The Mosaic Company produces and distributes DAP made and mined from phosphate and used as one of the world's three main types of fertilizers. It holds a 20% share of the U S DAP market which is the principal phosphate product Mosaic owns and operates mines and processing plants in Florida which produce phosphate fertilizer and feed phosphate and processing plants in Louisiana which produce phosphate fertilizer. The Company also has some potash and nitrogen fertilizers.

Key to this being a 4 bagger in the course of time is the following.

1-There is a rational management running things and a very rational long term owner in the private giant Company CARGILL which owns 55% of MOS.

2-DAP is at an all time high now of some $250/ton.

3-The company is closing plants in the face of likely rising demand.

4-Developing new phosphate rock mines is impossible as a result of environmental issues. So supply will not be increasing. It will be decreasing

5-Ethanol from grains such as corn is going to be on the rise over the next decade.

6-China is going to need to feed its rising urban manufacturing employment which previously raided on rural farm lands. Cheap farm labor will increasingly give way to improved farm productivity/yields which come from use of none other than fertilizer.

7-Annual world demand for food is maybe 3% and fertilizer follows this trend with variant swings due to weather (e.g. too much or to little rain.

8-The futures prices right now indicate higher prices for DAP next year.

9-On the margin it will take little added demand to cause major upward swing in pricing.

10-At some point year in time a major price swing will occur I know not when but it will due to the factors outlined and one more. When they do the grosz margins will soar and the profits will multiply geometrically.

11- The one more is this. Cargill at some point in time is going public. The way they are going to do it is to merge with its investment baby MOS. That time can come at the end of the five year (over 3 years to go) standstill negotiated when it made its purchase of what is now, and named by Cargill, MOS. Ask why Cargill named the Company Mosaic. Mosaic is a variety of different pieces an that is what Cargill is today. Cargill is an international provider of food products of all types and descriptions, a huge variety of agricultural and nutrient and feed ingredients, ingredients for pharmaceutical and dietary supplement and risk management products and services. It is a vast international empire with annual volume probably approaching $100 billion annually.

If the price is right Cargill will ""acquire MOS in the next maybe 4 or 5 or 6 years. If it does not it will be because MOS has risen far too high. Either way we profit from MOS with fertilizer earnings soaring from likely a doubled DAP price level with production held back or Cargill buying us out.

This is the big picture macro view and the details I leave to others who must kick tires and find out what makes the feet grow.
Catalyst
Production facilities being reduced(rationalized), prices for fertilizer DAP soaring at some point, as China likely will require substantial additional tonnage and the excitement of farms raising raw material for ethanol come into reality and possibility of Cargill buying the remainder of MOS which they do not now own in the next 5 years or so.

Description
  Realty Income (O) is triple net lease REIT that presents an excellent instrument to short commercial real estate, corporate defaults and a deep US recession.
    For background on Realty Income please see the excellent write up by msdonut940 on 12/27/2007.  msdonut940 recommended a short in December 2007 with the stock at $28.60.  Today at $23.15, Realty Income is still a good risk adjusted short opportunity.  
    Short Thesis
  Mis-pricing of Realty Income Capital Structure
  Realty Income equity is aimed primarily at retail investors who are focused on receiving a monthly dividend.  The company prides and sells itself as “a monthly dividend company” and the whole investor relations focus is directed to retail investors.  I don’t think issuing a monthly dividend warrants any premium but retail investors and the company’s focus on increasing the dividend multiple times a year for less than a fraction of a cent each time builds the false halo of safety. 
  This retail investor base focused on dividend growth has created the perfect instrument to short commercial real estate and indirectly corporate defaults/distressed.  The investor base is focused only on dividends and looks at Realty Income as basically a supercharged savings account paying 7% dividend without looking at risk of capital.
  Realty Income Capital Structure
  Realty Income capital structure has inverted with its senior bonds trading at 12% YTM, its preferreds trading at 10% current yield and its equity trades at 7% dividend yield.  While its long dated bonds trade at 50-60 cents on the dollar it equity is trading only down about 20% over the last year. 
  The credit markets for Realty Income and commercial real estate in general is basically frozen.  It is very unlikely O will be able to raise any new debt funding or sell properties as buyers have minimal to access to capital.  I don’t think the equity holders in O have any idea where its credit trades at or what its holdings of real estate are worth.  They are still operating under the assumption that O is an investment grade company issuing 5.875% 30 year paper. 
  [Long O bonds short the equity is an interesting capital structure trade.  It’s negatively biased and has positive carry.]
  Asset Valuation has Declined
  There is a retail investor myth that since O owns properties without underlying mortgages it is immune from destruction in CMBS.  O via its capital structure has recourse debt instead of non-recourse mortgage debt. The maturity schedule for the corporate debt of O is favorable for the company with no near term maturities.  But the destruction CMBS has to negatively affect the prices of O underlying 2,200 properties.  O cannot sell properties anywhere near the cap rates the equity is currently valuing it at. 
  O’s web site lays out 2008 versus 2007 financial metrics and every metric other than dividend is declining or negative!!! http://www.realtyincome.com/investing/summary_information.html
 
Corporate Default Optionality
  O indirect credit risk to the consumer economy has significant upside to a short position in the equity.  As the consumer and macro economy deteriorates there will be increased corporate defaults.  These defaults will lead to restructuring of leases over the 2009-2011 timeframe.  These restructurings should result in occupancy rates declining below 96%.  The triple net lease business model is high leveraged to occupancy rates – any decline in occupancy will directly impact FFO/AFFO and more importantly O’s dividend.   msdonut940 discusses the likely default of Buffets.  Buffets has since filed for bankruptcy and renegotiated some leases with O.  However, the Buffets bankruptcy has been an unmitigated disaster for distressed investors.  Buffets DIP trades at 20 cents on the dollar and it is very likely Buffets is liquidated in CH 7. 
  Given the state of the consumer economy, CMBS markets, corporate credit spreads/defaults and the lack of a DIP market.  I don’t see anything positive for the credit risk imbedded in O portfolio.
  Love the Retail Investor Base
    The retail base is oblivious to all the issues raised above as long as the dividend is paid.  The best thing about O is none of the credit and liquidity events of 2008 have been priced in.  The stock price has minimal negative expectation built into it unlike O’s corporate bonds which have declined 30 plus points since September 2008.  As defaults in leases increases, declining occupancy, declining FFO/AFFO, declining asset value and the recession impacts O performance through 2009-2011 the dividend will be cut. 
  The transition from retail to value in O equity will be very ugly.  Will any value investor buy O equity for 7% dividend yield when one can buy senior bonds for 12% YTM?
  Risk
  Irrationality of Retail Investors
  This company has issued shares at $26 with under a 7% dividend yield in September 2008 to raise capital.  If this management draws on the revolver/credit facility or some how manages to increase dividends by 1/10 cent the retail base might be more tempted by 7% dividend paid monthly versus a checking account paying 0% interest and have no regard for safety of principal.  The company is serial issuers of equity and would use any pop in equity price to issue new equity. 
  In an irrational market in which O trades at 7% dividend yield versus 12% YTM for its corporate debt there is no reason why the stock in the short term cannot trade at 5% dividend yield. 
  Hedging the Short Position
  I use O primarily as a hedge to offset a higher current yield portfolio of distressed/high yield/cross over corporate bonds trading at substantial discounts to par.

ePLUS is a technology vendor which combines software and hardware for sale or lease to others. It offers integrated systems to middle-market companies, states and municipalities and service organizations who do not have substantial in-house tech capabilities.

ePLUS was written up by adanah312 on 6/4/02 @ $9.10. The Company's equity market value was $94.5 mil based on the 10,384,220 shares outstanding at the time. Sales for the year ended 3/31/2002 were $205 mil, and the Company earned $8.9 mil after-tax with EPS of $0.87.

ePLUS was written up by hack731 on 12/31/2004 @ $10.92. The Company's equity market value was $97.8 mil based on the 8,954,258 shares outstanding at the time. Sales for the year ended 3/31/2005 were $480 mil, and the Company earned $25.3 mil after-tax with EPS of $2.68 fully-diluted. The wonderful increase in the reported EPS was heavily influenced by a $37 mil patent infringement suit settlement which netted the Company $33 mil after expenses. Without the settlement, I estimate that the Company earned around $0.80 per share after-tax which was down from the $1.02 reported for the prior year.

During the first 9 months of its 2006 fiscal year, the period ending on 12/31/2005, ePLUS reported an increase in sales of 19.5% but an increase in costs of 21.8%. Earnings declined from $5.8 mil to $4.4 mil and EPS from$0.53 to $0.42. There are two major reasons cited for this decline in profitability. First, legal expenses increased by $1.8 mil pretax or $1.1 mil after-tax due to the pursuit of a patent infringement case against SAP. In addition, the Company expanded equipment lease book from $183.8 mil to $205.8 mil, increasing depreciation from $7.9 mil to $12.7 mil. 

On 6/28/2006, ePLUS announced that it would have to delay the filing of the10-K for its 3/31/2006 fiscal year and that it would restate the 10-K's for 2004 and 2005. ""The restatement is expected to have no effect on the Company's revenue, earnings, or debt levels. The restatement includes a separate line item on the consolidated balance sheet for the accounts payable related to its floor plan financing agreements which had previously been included in accounts payable-trade..."". On 7/17/2006, ePLUS announced that it had received a letter from a stockholder raising concerns about the granting of stock options. Those concerns were taken up by the Audit Committeee and an investigation ensued. In order to be thorough, the Audit Committee reviewed all the options granted since the Company went public in 1996. They have determined that  ""actual measurement dates  for certain stock options granted by the Company in the fiscal years March 31, 1998 through March 31, 2005 differ from the recorded measurement dates."" Based on the ir review the charge to earnings for this is estimated to be about $3 mil. No doubt the cost of the investigation will be greater - call it $5 mil for a total charge of $8 mil. On another legal front, ePLUS had been in litigation with GMAC and Banc of America over leases that they had financed with an ePLUS customer named Cyberco Holdings. ePlus settled the suit with GMAC by paying them $6 mil. The suit brought by Banc of America was lost to the tune of $4 mil which includes costs. On the other hand, the suit against SAP was settled with SAP paying ePLUS $17.5 mil. There were no other legal proceedings noted in the 12/31/2005 10-Q. Over all, the SAP victory should just about exactly cover the Cyberco  matter and the  options charge and the cost of the investigation.

On 12/31/2005, ePLUS had stockholders equity of $131 mil of which $30 mil was goodwill and other, leaving hard book at $12.90  per share.

On 3/15/1999 an investor, Eric Hovde,  filed a 13-D on ePLUS after purchasing 379,324 shares at a price of about $8.50. Mr. Hovde has continued to purchase ePLUS stock. On 8/16/2006 his 13-D showed that he had increased his stake to 15.5% of the outstanding after having paid $12,838,072 for 1,265,129 shares or $10.15 a share. Mr. Hovde is an investment banker specializing in financial institutions and services. On 11/21/2006, Mr. Hovde and a partner, Irving Beimler, went onto the Board of ePLUS.
Phillip G. Norton is Chairman of the Company and owns 26.7% of the stock. Bruce M. Bowen, an EVP with the Company, was a Company founder and holds 8.7% of the stock. In all, insiders control 38.7% of the stock, not including Hovde's holdings.

Altogether, ePLUS seems to be a reasonable little business whose assets might be more productively used combined with another. With over $50 mil of patent infringement victories in the past two years, they clearly have some intellectual property of value. Their balance sheet is strong and earnings have been steady though not spectacular. Their options problem will be rectified by disclosure and a very manageable charge to earnings. Phillip Norton is 61 years old. Eric Hovde is most likely an owner who is running out of patience. Altogether, I believe that this is cheap enough and timely enough to be a buy.

Scribd Link: http://www.scribd.com/doc/130563184/Lulu-Writeup
LULU is no stranger to VIC (see write-up from January 2010 which outlines a short thesis based on overvaluation and competitive threats).  Today, LULU stock is significantly higher and the competition has increased dramatically.  We believe the valuation is unsustainable and consensus earnings will not be met.  Our view is that slowing comp sales, low new store productivity, unlikely success outside of North America (specifically, Hong Kong), and increasing competition (by many deep pocketed players) will put a major dent in the momentum driven investor base.  We believe that earnings will be underwhelming and the stock will be in the mid $40s or lower by year-end.

Slowing sales growth a concern
LULU has had one the highest top-line growth rates in the consumer sector over the past 5-plus years. For perspective, from 2007 to 2012, the company generated revenue CAGR of over 35% driven by mid-teens comparable sales, double-digit square footage growth, and the build out of its e-commerce business.
However, same-store-sales have slowed over the past several years from 30% in 2010, to 20% in 2011, and to around 16% in 2012 (Table 1). Importantly, same-store-sales are now expected to slow to under 10% in LULU’s January year end quarter.  We believe the slowing in the core business, combined with extremely challenging comparable sales figures the company is facing in early 2013, is likely to drive further slowing in same-store-sales over the course of 2013.
In addition to a muted macro environment and increased competition broadly, LULU is facing same-store-sales growth headwinds from its maturing store base (Table 2). LULU’s mature store base, defined as stores open for more than 5-years, is increasing significantly as a percent of their overall store base. In 2008, stores 5-years and older comprised 18% of LULU’s total store count. By year end 2012, LULU’s mature store base will be over 50%. The maturation of LULU’s store base puts significant pressure on the company’s new stores to generate very high growth to offset the much lower growth in the mature store base. To compound the issue of the maturation of the store base, is the fact that LULU’s mature store sales growth is slowing. Canada (50 stores) comped up mid-teens early in the year, but has now slowed to low-single digit as of 3Q12. This highlights the challenges in driving incremental sales in many of LULU’s highly productive mature stores and makes it unlikely LULU will sustain 10%-plus comps going forward, in our view.
Table 1: See Scribd document
Table 2: See Scribd document

Sustained productivity declines
We estimate the new store productivity is set to be below 60% for a third consecutive year. This is one of the lowest figures we have seen from a growth retailer, and we believe sub-60% is concerning – and, will result in sustained margin pressure going forward. 
LULU faces inherent margin headwinds over the next several years due to a combination of less leverage on its mature store base as sales slow and lower new store productivity. For perspective, we estimate LULU’s current store base has operating margins of around 34%-35%, running sales per store annually of $6mn. The issue for LULU revolves around lower new store productivity, where sales/store for new stores is about $3mn. Based on our understanding of LULU’s current fixed cost structure, it implies new store margins of around 25%. So, as LULU continues to aggressively expand the new store base at margins well below the older store base, margins will remain under pressure.
The street currently forecasts LULU’s margins to remain stable to growing. In our view, LULU faces the classic catch-22. LULU can either continue to drive aggressive store expansion which will drive margins lower faster as management tries to sustain total sales growth. Or, LULU will be forced to slow store expansions as new store productivity slows as less attractive locations are available. In which case, total reported sales growth could slow meaningfully.
I believe there is sizeable risk to LULU earnings in 2013 and 2014 (Table 4). Based on comps that that are already slowing and increasing competition broadly, we believe comps will slow to 7% in 2013 and mid-single digits in 2014 and 25%-30% growth in the ecommerce business. We assume LULU remains aggressive in building out square footage growth, with 20% square footage growth over the next two years. From a margin perspective, LULU likely faces two headwinds. First, as comps decline to 7% there is limited to no margin leverage, while 5% comps result in margin deleverage. Second, LULU new store margins run around 25% and as the mature store base continues to slow, the margin dilution from new store will drive more visible dilution in LULU company store margin. We believe LULU total company margins could see 300bps of margin compression over the next two years based off of slow comps, dilution from new stores at lower productivity, and a continued ramp in cost associated with ecommerce and the international rollout. We  believe LULU is unlikely to earn $2 in earnings in either 2013 or 2014, well below street estimates of $2.26 and $2.80 respectively.
I believe the market, and especially LULU bulls, are grossly underappreciating the “perfect storm” LULU faces in regards to margin pressure. LULU has largely been able to compensate for below average new store productivity and 20%ish margins on the new store base because LULU’s current (i.e. open more than one-year) store base has been comping double-digit over the past two years, which has resulted in enough margin leverage at the current stores to mask the margin dilution from new stores. As comps continue to slow on current stores and margin leverage evaporates from those stores, the dilution from the new stores will becoming increasingly visible. While comps slow, LULU is ramping investment internationally. However, we believe these costs are going to continue to increase well beyond the top-line benefit from new international stores – this dynamic will only compound margin pressures LULU faces in the domestic business and ecommerce mix benefits cannot feasibly offset margin pressure. Lastly, we believe LULU is likely to face on-going cost pressure from China labor costs, which will put pressure on the company’s cost structure as well.

International expansion unlikely to be successful
As sales in North America have decelerated, LULU’s management team is focused on building out the business more internationally. LULU plans to begin pre-seeding activities in up to 15 countries over a two-year period, including further penetration of these markets through the build-out of showrooms. The two larger markets that LULU attempts to grow in near-term are London and Hong Kong. We have skepticism that LULU will be successful in these markets.
Hong Kong is not an entirely new market to LULU. LULU opened up its first showroom in Hong Kong over 4 years ago in October 2008. The showroom operated as a retail shop Thursday to Saturdays and also offered complimentary yoga classes. We believe the length of time from LULU’s first showroom (over 4-years) to its more aggressive expansion efforts currently, highlights the significant risk around the success of LULU in the Asian market. (http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/200810/25/P200810240141.htm)
In addition, yoga shops in Hong Kong continue to struggle. Yoga shops throughout 2010 to present have shut down due to financial problems. As highlighted in the article embedded below, the combination of bad customer experience and lack of industry standards and the passing of a “fad” led to distress for many yoga companies throughout Hong Kong. (http://www.travelwireasia.com/2011/01/yoga-and-hong-kong-now-thats-stretching-it/)
 Based on our research and the fact LULU has operated a showroom in Hong Kong for already over 4-years, seems to suggest to us that a market such as Hong Kong being a huge growth driver is unlikely.
  Competition is not going away
The competitive pressures surrounding LULU continue to mount. It is well known that LULU will continue to face significant pressure from retail heavyweights such as Nike, Under Amour, and Adidas. However, there is an increasing threat from small niche yoga apparel companies, many offering similar products at a lower price point. Recent new comers, include Ellie, a LA company that received capital. Australian active wear retailer, Lorna Jane, opened its first store in CA last and has continued to see success. The company is considering opening up to another 16 stores in 2013, on top of the 9 stores opened last year. In addition, GAP continues to make headway with its Athleta brand, and expected to open 50 U.S. stores by the end of 2013.
The table below highlights the number of competitors LULU is now facing. Many of these competitors continue to expand aggressively. We believe LULU is facing now facing the most competitive operating environment it has ever witnessed.
Table 4: See Scribd document
  Valuation
We think the slowing comp sales, low new store productivity, margin risk, and increased competition do not support LULU’s current valuation of north of 35x P/E. We believe comps are set to slow to 7% this year and 5% in 2014 which put substantial pressure on lower EPS and multiple. We believe LULU is likely to earn around $2 per share in FY2014, well below consensus of $2.80. Assuming a P/E of 20x-25x, it would imply a value in the mid $40’s – 35% downside from current levels.
Risks: The largest risk is LULU’s short interest at nearly 20%, success expansion in international markets, and a more robust macro recovery.

For investors willing to stretch their investment horizon 24+ months. I think Impinj ""PI"" provides an extremely compelling risk-reward. PI designs and sells an integrated circuit (""IC"") in a duopoly market that has grown at compounded annual rate of over 30% the last 8 years and has the potential to grow multitudes of its current size.  
  Assuming the market continues to just hum along (20% unit growth), but never re-accelerates to ""hyper-growth"" which I define as around 40+% over a multi-year period - I think PI on a private market-basis has limited downside and trades around 7x 2019 owner's earnings to a strategic acquirer.   
  What they do: 
  PI provides a RAIN radio frequency identification ""RFID"" tags, reader chips, readers, and software.  
  RAIN is a technical standard for RFID. While anyone could build RAIN tags as the standard is public, the market is concentrated between two players PI 60% and NXP 40% due to the complexity and processes of building a high performing IC within the standard.
  PI RAIN tag sales have grown at a 36% CAGR over the last 7 years from 900 million tags to over 6 billion in 2016.   
  A tag is really just an electronic bar-code that can be read via handheld or fixed readers over a distance of up to 30 feet.  
  Tags are sold to value-added resellers for a little over a cent. 
  A reader chip enables a device to read a tag – these can be handheld readers, or fixed gateways. PI has the dominant shareof the reader chip market.
  These have ASPs of about $15+. 
  They also sell fixed gateways that have ASPs of $100s-$1,000+. 
  RFID is certainly not new, but the movement to a standard – RAIN – and the inevitable ubiquity of connectivity has made RAIN tags an extremely compelling tool in multiple industries which can be seen from total tag deployments of 1.6 billion in 2010 to over 9.5 billion last year. 
  The largest use case today is in the apparel industry – where there are 8.5 billion units currently tagged out of an approximate market of over 80 billion apparel units.  
  If you talk to people in the industry the view is that at some point the majority of this apparel will be tagged. The reasons are primarily the following: item level intelligence is foundational for omni-channel retail, and at a certain threshold, 30% from my conversations, apparel suppliers move to tagging all of their inventory even if not requested by the retailer as it enables them to use the benefit of tagged inventory and mitigates need for running two supply chain processes.  
  I think the best data for this market is provided by the University of Auburn RFID lab. (https://rfid.auburn.edu/research-papers/). 
In their ""2016 State of RFID Adoption Among U.S. Apparel Retailers"" they note the process for deploying RFID is as follows: 
  Proof of concept where a retailer over 3-12 months in 1-2 stores will trial a few merchandise categories. 
  Pilot a 1 year process across multiple stores and more categories. 
   Phased deployment where a retailer rolls out fixed infrastructure and tag all merchandise in a store and begin rolling out this full solution. 
  Full deployment fixed infrastructure and all merchandise tagged in every store. 
  What is fascinating is that in 2016 – full deployments grew 100% with 4% of retailers in full deployment, while phased deployments grew 18% with 39% of retailers in a form of phased deployment. Pilots grew 57% and proofs of concept grew 42%. Every large retailer is in some part of this process. To me, it is clear at some point, this industry is going to massively grow. 
  Other large industries utilizing RAIN RFID are logistics, supply chain, and healthcare. For example, Delta Airlines tags every checked-in bag utilizes fixed readers across its in-terminal infrastructure to provide passengers real-time updates on their luggage. In healthcare sample and pharmaceutical tracking are paramount to hospital operations. 
  One of the most interesting industries where it is not yet used, but is seeing increased interest is in food retail, and according to management this has progressed faster than many had anticipated. In Japan, due to labor shortages, all of the C-Stores are making investments to RFID enabled stores. Every item in the store will be tagged and the checkout process fully-automated. The Japanese C-Stores sell 100 billion items annually.  
  In tags, PI goes to market exclusively through in-lay providers, basically value-added re-sellers who take PI tags and embed them into apparel. The majority of their business is concentrated among Smartrac 16%, Avery Dennison 14%, Arizon 11%, Shang Yang 10%, and Blue Star 9%. 
  Avery Dennison, which is public, has discussed their RFID business for years, and has consistently forecasted the market significantly below its actual growth. Today they are still very bullish and see a long-runway of 15-20+% growth primarily due the large visibility they have into retailer deployment pipelines which is corroborated by the Auburn report. 
  Why does this opportunity exist? 
  In 3Q PI had disappointing earnings, one might even say very disappointing as the stock dropped 40%. The biggest concern as a long-term shareholder is the accelerated price erosion in their IC tags. The company has consistently stated they see price erosion around mid-single digits and that had edged up a little in the latest quarter. Coming off a year where they had 70+% unit growth and had some shortages into a year where there were some push-outs in deployments (management explanation) there was a little extra discounting on IC prices by the competition. The biggest risk to this investment in my opinion is accelerated price erosion and while this is worrisome from many industry conversations do not see this as a trend and management explanation seem reasonable.  
  The holy grail would be a moving reader chips into consumer electronics – Alexa's, your fridge, cell-phone etc. While this is 3+ years off – talking to people it is a logical place for this market to go. Moving item level intelligence into people's homes – understanding what they have purchased and when those items are no longer in there – ie. there is was a milk container in the fridge and now there is no milk in the fridge is quite interesting.  
  Valuation 
  PI is making massive investments as they believe this is a market that will 5+x over the next 5 years. They are investing in all layers of their solution – with an emphasis on software that today does not contribute any revenue to their business.  
I think either this is an industry that will either be 5+x as large over next few years, at 55+% gross margins, and they will have a tremendous amount of operating leverage or this kind of ho-hums along for sometime before it gets sold and rationalized. 
  R&D has grown from $10 million in 2013 to a run rate of $30+ million  
S&M – is primarily used as they say they for hunting whales and continuing to establish this industry.  They work with massive potential customers on how to deploy RFID solutions and this line item has grown from $10 million to a run rate of over $30 million.  
G&A – they have built a full public company operation going from $5 million in 2013 to a run-rate of over $16 million. 
  There has been lots of consolidation in semiconductor space and my view is that If this market peters out then the need to keep pushing envelope on R&D and S&M is just not there. I don’t think it's crazy to bring this down to their 2013/2014 expenses structure.
  Primarily stop investing in software, and move to sustaining R&D of $10-15m, $7-10m of S&M, and $5m of G&A.   
If market continues to grow units 20% with 5% ASP declines with this restructured cost base get to about $60 million of EBIT.  
  The upside is really hard to quantify – but if end-points double over next 3 years then this business is trading 2-3x gross profit and massively growing – it is just way too cheap

I am recommending a long position in CZR with a price target of $38 in the next 1-2 months. I believe CZR is severely misunderstood and very poorly analyzed, so much so that the recent move in the stock has simply confounded people. Not only is the recent move justified, in my opinion, there is more to go. Here is why I believe the stock will trade to $38 in the short term:
  CZR is a very out of consensus idea. It is heavily shorted (almost unborrowable at this point), every analyst that covers it either has a hold or a sell rating and the shorts are constantly in the press, pitching it as a bankruptcy candidate. Not only do I think CZR is not going bankrupt, I believe there is significant upside in the stock.
  The reasons to dislike CZR are obvious. It is levered over 12x EBITDA, they burn almost $500M in cash/year and they have a 2015 $4.5B maturity that the shorts believe they can’t get past. It is easy to believe that there is no equity value under all this debt so CZR is not only technically bankrupt, it will run out of cash in 3 years. None of that will matter, according to the shorts because CZR won’t be able to refinance its $4.4B PropCo CMBS maturity for 2/15, which will push the company into bankruptcy even earlier.
  I believe this thought process to be very wrong. One cannot look at CZR as one levered company. It has many component parts that are in fact bankruptcy-remote to each other. There is a HoldCo, a PropCo, an OpCo and now a SpinCo. CZR is spinning off (through a rights offering) many interesting and attractive properties into CAC (Caesars Acquisition Co). This company will trade under the ticker “CGP”. It will be very under-levered, generate a lot of cash, and will be CZR’s growth vehicle. It will be a very attractive stock to own and at the rights offering price of $9.43/share, I believe very cheap.
  The entire PropCo structure has traded up significantly in the last few weeks as Debtwire is reporting that CZR is in the market to refinance this entity. I believe this process will soon be finished and take near-term bankruptcy risk off the table. The next time the company will have potential issues is going to be 2017 (3 years away). But I believe even that is fixable.
  PropCo currently has $4.4B of debt and will do about $515M of EBITDA in 2014. I believe that this debt burden will be reduced to $4B through negotiation and improving the collateral pool at PropCo (I would explain further but then it would become a very long pitch. Once you start to work on this, it is easy to see how this is possible). The refinanced structure will have many component pieces probably, including a PIK note (possibly) so that while PropCo credit doesn’t trap real liquidity in the structure, it accretes value while CZR doesn’t de-lever. I believe the blended rate on this structure will be about 7% and PropCo is worth about $8.5/share.

  Further there is cash and some receivables at HoldCo worth about $3.75/share. Together PropCo & HoldCo are worth about $12/share.
  This brings us to OpCo, the ugly stepchild. OpCo is levered 13x EBITDA and arguably drains equity value from the rest of the entities. I believe this is incorrect. There is a set of parent guarantees at OpCo that link it to the rest of the entities. However, these guarantees can be removed, making OpCo its own animal. OpCo could be worth zero but I don’t believe it has negative value to CZR.
  The Parent guarantee reads:
  In addition, the Parent Guarantee is automatically released upon the election of the Issuer and notice to the Trustee if the guarantee by Caesars Entertainment of the Credit Agreement, the Existing Notes or any other Indebtedness which resulted in the obligation to guarantee the Notes has been released or discharged.
Definitions:
“Existing Notes” means the Issuer’s 5.375% Senior Notes due 2013, 5.625% Senior Notes due 2015, 6.500% Senior Notes due 2016, 5.75% Senior Notes due 2017, 10.75% Senior Notes due 2016 and 10.75%/11.50% Senior Toggle Notes due 2018.
“Credit Agreement” means (i) the credit agreement, dated as of January 28, 2008, entered into in connection with the consummation of the Acquisition, among the Issuer, the pledgors named therein, the financial institutions named therein, and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, as amended, restated, supplemented, waived, replaced (whether or not upon termination, and whether with the original lenders or otherwise), restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise modified from time to time, including any agreement or indenture extending the maturity thereof, refinancing, replacing or otherwise restructuring all or any portion of the Indebtedness under such agreement or agreements or indenture or indentures or any successor or replacement agreement or agreements or indenture or indentures or increasing the amount loaned or issued thereunder or altering the maturity thereof and (ii) whether or not the credit agreement referred to in clause (i) remains outstanding, if designated by the Issuer to be included in the definition of “Credit Agreement,” one or more (A) debt facilities or commercial paper facilities, providing for revolving credit loans, term loans, receivables financing (including through the sale of receivables to lenders or to special purpose entities formed to borrow from lenders against such receivables) or letters of credit, (B) debt securities, indentures or other forms of debt financing (including convertible or exchangeable debt instruments or bank guarantees or bankers’ acceptances), or (C) instruments or agreements evidencing any other Indebtedness, in each case, with the same or different borrowers or issuers and, in each case, as amended, supplemented, modified, extended, restructured, renewed, refinanced, restated, replaced or refunded in whole or in part from time to time.
  I believe the easiest way for CZR to remove the parent guarantees is to pay down or refinance the “Existing Notes” or Senior Unsecured Notes. These are $2.1B worth of paper trading at 70 cents. CZR already owns $1.1B of this paper and is contributing it to CAC so they only need to get rid of another $1B worth. With $1.8B of cash, $1B of potential new debt capacity, $800M of cash coming in from the Macau land sale and the CGP rights offering, CZR has plenty of liquidity to remove the guarantee from OpCo. (While I believe the guarantee language is clear, it is a good idea to get legal advice on it when you begin doing serious work)
  This completely makes OpCo bankruptcy-remote to the rest of the structure, allowing us to value the other businesses separately. However, even though OpCo can’t mess things up, there are plenty of interesting assets at OpCo. I believe after removing the guarantee CZR will go to the 2nd liens, who will sit under 7x of debt ($5.5B of paper at 10%, trading at 60 cents) and negotiate with them to equitize their stake. Since there is a high likelihood that the 2nd liens wont be the fulcrum security in bankruptcy, it is in their interest to negotiate with CZR to get a piece of the now, very interesting equity. Not only will this move de-lever OpCo significantly, it will allow OpCo to generate cash and de-lever naturally, making the equity position very attractive. I believe the market is totally missing CZR’s ability to restructure their debt in this manner. (I am happy to lay out what I think this deal will look like and why the 2nd liens would do it but again, it would make for a really long writeup right now)
  There is potentially lots of value at OpCo but for now, let’s just assume that it’s worth zero and move on to CAC. CZR (sometime in the next 4 weeks probably) will do a rights offering to give its shareholder the rights to purchase 1 share of CAC for every share of CZR they hold.
  The Sponsors (who own 70% of the equity) have committed to excersising $500M worth of rights. There will be a pro-rata over-subscription for un-exercised rights. For our purposes, we will assume that all the rights will be exercised by someone. Post the offering, CZR will own 57% of CGP and CAC (publically owned piece) will own 43%.
  Here are the assets that will sit in CGP:
  Planet Hollywood Casino & 50% of the management fee of PH
Horseshoe Baltimore Development & 50% of the management fee of HB
$1.1B of CEOC (OpCo notes, yielding over 9% at contributed value)
Over $900M of cash
Caesars Interactive Entertainment (CIE)
  CAC will have 125.4M shares outstanding (recall that this will be 43% of the ownership of CGP)

  Real-money online gambling is a key part of the thesis here and there are varying views on how big this market will be. One thing to remember here is the CZR has about 30% share of the total gaming market in the U.S. and with their partner 888, they will be a formidable force in this market and are set up to be the market leader. I would recommend reading some of the Morgan Stanley pieces on market sizing.
  CGP’s S1 estimates this market to be about $9.6B (online poker when it was illegal to operate in the U.S. was already a $2B market) so this number is not crazy. Other sources have numbers ranging from $6B to $20B. We will value each scenario:

          So when we add this together, I believe that CAC will be worth between $23-$28 without any future growth projects. On a PV basis, CAC is worth between $15.4-$16.1. Lets just call it $15.5, i.e. When a CZR shareholder purchases the right to buy 1 share of CAC (ticker CGP), he will pay $9.43 for something that is worth $15.50. I believe this will be a very popular no-brainer trade. Moreover, CZR has a potential project in Boston and the recently announced potential projects in Japan, that will eventually end up in CGP as well. CGP is after all Caesar Growth Partners, it will be the growth vehicle for the combined entities. It is very well capitalized and has a great management team, setting it up for a lot of success.
  When CGP trades at $15.5 (potentially is worth $28 ex Boston & Japan), CZR’s stake (57%) is going to be worth $20.5/share. Recall that we have already determined that PropCo & HoldCo are worth $12/share. This makes CZR worth $32.5/share currently. However, since we stand to make almost $5.5/share on CGP (which I think a lot of people would want to get long), I expect that CZR shares will trade through intrinsic value and reflect the potential in CGP and should trade at $32.5+$5.5 = $38, about 45% upside in the near future.
  However, this is really the gift that keeps on giving, I do believe that there is equity value at OpCo post a friendly debt restructuring given that the 2nd liens should be happy to convert once the stripping of the parent guarantees leave them out in the cold. Plus, we have Boston and Japan and the potential allocation of current growth projects underway at CZR (LINQ and Gansevoort, which should be very attractive).
  There is one other interesting wrinkle to be aware of. CZR is a heavily, heavily shorted stock. There is a very low float. If you are short CZR, a few really bad things can happen to you. First, you have to be a registered holder of CZR to exercise your right (per the S1). The rights are non-transferrable and non-tradable!
  I believe that owners of CZR who want to exercise their rights (like any rights offering, if you don’t exercise, you get diluted) will recall their shares in CZR compelling shorts to cover. This may not occur since banks can synthetically create rights to force shorts to provide you fair value of the right. However, you don’t benefit from the over-subscription feature if this is the case so you will recall anyway in order to potentially get more than 1 share of CGP for every share of CZR. It is a very scary dynamic.
  Not only are the shorts going to be potentially recalled, they are also short CGP as they can’t cover the right in the market. I understand if you want to be short CZR but it makes no sense to be short CGP. CGP will have similar technical dynamics on its first trading day. Lots of short interest, low float, lots of real new buyers who want exposure to this growth story at a very attractive price.
  If I am correct in valuing CZR at $32.5, then CZR shorts stand to lose $12/share on CZR and CGP combined from the current price. This is why I believe the stock will trade at $38 pre the rights offering (which should happen in the next 4 weeks).
  However, that is just current intrinsic value. Las Vegas trends are improving dramatically as evidenced by MGM stock. 2014 and 2015 are setting up to be very good convention years (40% of CZR is Vegas). PropCo CMBS debt is currently in negotiation to be refinanced and should take the near-term 2015 maturity out of the equation. This gives CZR 3 years of run-way before they have a liquidity problem. In the meantime, they burn $500M/year. However, I believe that very soon, they will negotiate with the 2nd lien holders by removing the Parent guarantee (requires refinancing or paying off of Senior Unsecured Notes). The interest expense on the 2nd liens incidentally is $550M. Once you cross that hurdle, this becomes a levered structure that can actually de-lever where this is massive amounts of value in the component parts. This is one of Apollo’s biggest deals. I don’t believe they will allow this company to go bankrupt so easily and I believe that the equity market has been very wrong in realizing how fixable this situation is and how dangerous the technical dynamics of the short thesis are, especially as CZR owners begin to recall their shares for the rights offering.

Thesis:
We believe the casual dining sector is ripe with short candidates as many companies lap difficult 2018 comparisons right at a time when labor inflation is intensifying.  In our opinion, TXRH is one of the better risk/rewards within this short theme as the stock has liquidity (many restaurants have tight floats and high short interest), a sky high valuation and material labor inflation risk which will cause significant margin headwinds. We think the market is failing to discount the potential profit shortfall driven by weaker than expected traffic growth and higher than expected costs. We expect the valuation to re-rate closer to a slight market multiple premium of 16x-17x as the company misses profit expectations and the street adjusts growth expectations lower  - implying a share price of low to mid $40s over the next 6-12 months. 
  Brief Company Description: 
TXRH is a casual dining steakhouse chain founded in 1994. It operates almost entirely in the US, where it has 491 company-owned units and 91 franchise units. The brand positions itself as a place where the “working man can get a steak dinner.” 
  TXRH locations are highly customized: the average box size is 7,500 square feet, the average guest ticket is ~$17, and AUV is $5MM. The restaurants are open only for dinner, with the exception of Saturday and Sunday lunch (and at some locations, Friday lunch).
  The Bull Case:
The bull case rests on investors’ view that TXRH is a high quality casual restaurant company with a loyal customer base and an opportunity to continue growing new units. In a challenging casual dining industry (low growth, limited unit growth, saturation), bulls believe TXRH deserves a premium valuation to the market and peers due to its fairly consistent growth. We believe that most bulls believe valuation is reasonable considering TXRH’s low double-digit sales and earnings growth over the past several years. 
  Short Thesis
Labor Cost Inflation 
Our conservations with restaurant operators combined with recent economic data suggest that wage pressures show little signs of abating in the near-term and may continue to accelerate. 
  As you can see from the table 1 and 2 below,  wage inflation is set to continue its acceleration in 2019 driven by moderate economic growth and the ongoing  tightness in the labor market. The company is expecting mid-single-digit labor inflation in 2019. We believe the risks are to the upside based on our conversations with operators and recent economic data.  
  Labor costs have been an headwind for TXRH over the past several years, however, the company has been able to offset some of the cost pressures due to a favorable commodity environment for beef prices and better than expected traffic trends. The company increased menu prices 1.7% in November of 2018 to partially offset wages issues, however the continued increase in wage pressure has forced the company to increase price again. On the 4th 2018 earnings conference call, management indicated another price increase of 1.5%. We are skeptical the price increase will allow the company to offset the cost pressures going forward. 
  Table 1: NFIB Small Business Cost of Labor Single Most Important Problem 
    Table 2: Nordea U.S Leading Wage Indicator 
  Table 3: TXRH Cost of Labor as % of Sales 
 

(2) Higher Cost of Goods 
Lower than expected beef prices have been a significant tailwind for the company over the past several years as you can see from table below. Lower cost of goods inflation has been a significant driver in helping the company preserve profits despite labor cost issues. Management is guiding to 1%-2% commodity inflation in 2019, but we believe inflationary pressures tilt to the upside going forward. 
  Beef prices appear to be near cyclical lows. Beef accounts for ~45% of COGS. Historically, peak-to-trough cyclical swings in beef prices have represented ~300bps swings in margin for TXRH, and, thus, the recent low prices are providing a substantial tailwind. Analysts are far offsides modeling 30bps of COGs leverage through 2020 given beef prices are likely heading higher.

(3) Traffic Growth Risk
TXRH believes the company has a reasonable amount of pricing power to combat rising inflation costs without seeing much traffic deceleration. However we observe that price elasticity of demand isn't nearly as strong as the company would suggest. When the menu price increases were cut back in 2014, traffic growth surged. When price growth again accelerated in 2015-16, traffic growth again decelerated nearly double the rate. 
    Valuation: When traffic slowed significantly in the last cycle TXRH relative multiple contracted to a more modest premium vs the greater than 50% premium it supports now. 
 


Conclusion:  
  We find THRH to be a compelling short at today’s levels.  A rising labor and food cost environment coupled with an extremely lofty valuation leaves TXRH susceptible to any disappointment in expectations.  We believe fair value is at $40-$45. Using the group average 16x-17x P/E implying 36% downside.

 Judging from the stock performance, low valuation, and headlines, most casual investors might assume that Genworth is primarily a US mortgage insurance (MI) company.
It's not.
It's a diversified life insurer (spun out from GE in 2004 with a history dating back to 1871 and operations in 25 countries). GNW has three primary operating businesses: Retirement & Protection, International, and US Mortgage Insurance. Retirement & Protection consists of life insurance, annuities, wealth management, and long-term care health insurance. International consists of mortgage insurance in Canada and Australia and payment protection in Europe. MI in Canada and Australia are very different businesses from in the US and remain solidly profitable for Genworth.  Payment protection provides for insurance against accident, sickness, and unemployment. In US Mortgage Insurance, Genworth is a top 5 player in a fairly concentrated market.

US mortgage insurance makes up only 10% of GNW's total revenue.  It is almost a rounding error. US MI's impact on the bottom line has obviously been outsized recently and insurance losses can extend far beyond the revenue collected, but the table above is meant to demonstrate that Genworth will very likely be able to ride out the storm hitting the US mortgage insurance industry.
Genworth's Balance Sheet
In addition to the serious problems in its US MI business, Genworth was rocked by escalating mark-to-market (MTM) losses in its $65B investment portfolio. Bankruptcy was priced in last November, with the stock plummeting to 71 cents. The accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet (i.e. net investment losses) went from +$0.7 billion in Q4/07 to -$3.1 billion in Q1/09 in conjunction with substantial realized losses as well. Book value per share fell from $31 at the end of 2007 to $19 at the end of Q1/09. However, the marks have reversed sharply the past two quarters and AOCI actually stood at a positive figure ($23M) at the end of the third quarter, with book value at over $25. This is remarkable. As a general observation of third quarter results and conference calls, it is remarkable how little attention the improved balance sheet of many financial companies has received. Many analysts are complaining about the low earnings (but they're positive!) in the midst of a severe recession.
Retirement & Protection
Annual earnings for this division are down from a pre-crisis run-rate of roughly $750M to $400-500M currently, primarily due to sensitivity to the depressed stock market. While earnings are down, this is a solidly profitable business with sticky assets and customers that should continue to benefit over the long-term from the secular trend of retiring baby-boomers. In the meantime, these earnings have helped to absorb losses in the US MI business, thus insuring GNW's own survival. 
International
Genworth's Canadian mortgage insurance business earned $45M in Q3/09, down from $58M in Q2, largely reflecting the partial IPO. In an effort to shore up its balance sheet and reassure investors, Genworth IPO'd 42.5% of its Canadian insurance business in July, generating $705M in proceeds. This has hurt earnings going forward, but it allowed GNW to avoid any government assistance as well as retire all long-term debt due in 2009 and 2010. Genworth has only one competitor in Canada, the Canadian government, which is a very rational player. This beneficial arrangement is set to continue for the foreseeable future.
Australian MI earnings were up sequentially from $32M to $42M, and have yet to report a loss as well. Genworth has noted in recent presentations that house prices have actually increased in the past quarter in both Australia and Canada, which should prevent any future losses from occurring, even if the recession does drag on. Additionally, the company has recently noted it is getting 20% price increases in 2009 on top of 17% increases in 2008. Given mortgage delinquencies of only 0.42% in Canada and 0.48% in Australia compared to 3.84% in the US, it is clear these businesses are quite different from their US counterpart and very attractive for Genworth. Slide 14 from GNW's recent investor presentation has some great information detailing the differences:  http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9MzUwMjU3fENoaWxkSUQ9MzQzNDI2fFR5cGU9MQ==&t=1. GNW has only one other major competitor in Australia, a favorable competitive dynamic comparable to that in Canada, which should also continue for the foreseeable future.
Payment Protection (i.e insurance for accidents, sickness, job loss similar to what Aflac offers) in Western Europe was a mild concern, but earnings rebounded in Q3 (to $12 from $4M in Q2) on top of strong prices increases. Given the lagging nature of unemployment, it is very possible that claims continue to rise, but it looks as if prices increases and renegotiations have more than offset this.
US Mortgage Insurance
This business has been a disaster for Genworth. It lost $116M in 3Q/09 (including a $62M legal settlement) and will probably lose near $500M for the full year and $510-200M next year. However, at the KBW insurance conference on September 9th, CFO Kelleher noted prospects for the US MI business are bright, with 35% price increases YOY and 20%+ ROEs on new business, even as high as 35%, with better risk parameters. Volumes on this new business are low, however, because of fierce competition from a new competitor-the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), whose market share in US MI has gone from 4% in 2006 to 33% today. The WSJ had a great article today (November 12) on why the FHA's market share is likely unsustainable. Delinquency rates on its 2008 book of loans, already over 15%, are on track to be the worst on record. (By contrast, Genworth's 2008 delinquencies are near 4%.) As the FHA recognizes its substantial losses, it will be forced to step back, creating room for GNW to step up and write a lot more business at highly profitable rates. This could be a huge wave for Genworth.
Surprisingly, none of GNW's major pure-play competitors in this space (MGIC, RDN, and PMI) have gone bankrupt, although TGIC is in regulatory mandated run-off and there are serious concerns about PMI. If PMI does fail or goes into run off, it will not be very long before investors begin to recognize GNW as one of the top 3 players left that has the capital strength to write lots of new attractively priced business with ROEs north of 25%.
Recent Capital Raise
In addition to the Canadian MI IPO, Genworth successfully completed a $622M secondary offering of stock in September-55M shares at $11.27 per share. Both of these transactions were mildly dilutive to future EPS, but have done much to improve GNW's regulatory capital and leverage. While insurance regulatory ratios are even more confusing than bank regulatory ratios to many non-specialists, the TCE ratio (tangible common equity divided by total assets) will improve nicely, from a low of 5.8% in Q1/08 to an estimated 9.7% for Q3/09. It is a solid balance sheet with excess capital and plenty of capacity to absorb losses from the mortgage insurance operations for a few more quarters.
Valuation
GNW currently trades at 45% of its Q3/09 of Q3's $25.42 stated book value and 50% of its $22.80 tangible book value. Genworth still has issues to work through, but it is making money and within a relatively short time-frame (4 or 5 quarters), US mortgage insurance will go from being a huge earnings head-wind to a substantial tail-wind. Companies with positive earnings, stable balance sheets, and strong pricing trends tend not to trade at such sharp discounts to tangible book for very long. With a little luck, GNW can earn $1.00+ of EPS in 2010 and $2 in 2011. With the stock at $11, there is still considerable upside.

Summary. 
This recommendation is as much about a sector as it is about a stock.  I have been shorting the for-profit education sector for a long time.  Now it is time to buy it.
  ITT Technical Institute, as everybody has heard of, is a leading provider of postsecondary degree programs in the US, with 66,000 students currently enrolled.  They have 150 college campuses across the country offering master, bachelor, and associate degree programs.  ITT Technical Institute has been providing career-oriented education programs since 1969.
  You can buy an established, 43 year old, stable, geographically diverse, brand name business with high margins, low cyclicality, no foreign exposure, a defensible market position and a network of established campuses across the country, in a growing industry for 3x earnings.  Earnings are all cash and, except for the last couple years, have grown every year, forever. (Even including the recent pull back in results, earnings have grown 800% since 2000.)  They have a net cash balance sheet, earnings are all cash with no cap ex or working capital requirements, and they spend 100% of their net income on share repurchases. Plus, the earnings will very likely prove to be a secular and cyclical low.
  This is a really cheap stock. 
  History
  My experience with the industry goes back a decade and a half to the Computer Learning Centers and Sylvan frauds, right up to the current batch of for-profit education stocks. Up to now, I have only been on the short side of these POS’s.  I certainly can’t say I haven’t left some money on the table on the short side, but regardless, I know the sector well, and I know a perfect stock opportunity when I see one.   And I know when the stock market becomes blind to a perfect opportunity, after years and years of bad news.  (What was your reaction to the name?)
  The companies in this sector seem to always succumb to the temptations inherent in a system where “someone else” (the Federal Gov’t) pays the bills and results didn’t really matter much.  With low accountability, and an often ignorant consumer who doesn’t need to put up much or any money, the sector was rife with dubious business practices and fraud.
  However, these things have changed or are changing.  The government has cracked down on suspect business practices and put new regulations in place to ensure proper accountability -- like loan default limits, debt/income metrics limits and guidelines for recruiters. Student retention has also come under scrutiny by regulators and accreditors.  Also, after a lot of bad publicity, consumers are now very wary, appropriately, of these schools and of taking on student loan debt.
  The result of the regulatory changes and negative media attention has been a dramatic drop in enrollment across the industry, margins have compressed, competition has intensified, and many programs have closed or are in the process of disappearing. The sector has clearly been split into winners and losers, with the losers still trying to adapt.

  Issues
  “These schools are all a scam”: False.  Unless you are also saying that all second and third tier universities in the country are all “scams,” in which case I would agree with you, on both counts.  Yes, there have been frauds in the industry -- many. Yes, they have admitted students who weren’t prepared for school and had no real chance of graduating, have passed students who didn’t deserve it, because they have financial incentive to do so.  Yes it’s wrong, fraudulent and a waste of taxpayer money.   Is it entirely the school’s fault if someone who wasn’t prepared for the work wanted to go to their school?  Is Weight Watcher’s a “scam” because they don’t refund your money when you don’t stick to the diet? Does it matter? No, not really, as long as these schools stay within the new regulations, which address these and other issues.  Ultimately, the schools must do a decent job in order for them stay within the default and job placement targets, plain and simple.
  Too much regulatory risk: False.  This was true three years ago.  Given the new regulations that were finalized last year, after many years of intense political and media scrutiny, this is no longer a “risk.”   Right now, we actually have full clarity on the regulatory landscape.   The new rules were proposed three years ago and were slated to go into effect July 1, 2012, though a judge struck down part of the regulation.  The department of education will probably appeal.  Either way, when the rules do finally go into effect, we know what they will look like and it will take three years of performance before schools are even evaluated for violations.  The regulatory landscape is clearer for the foreseeable future than it has been in many years.
  While the discussions still go on about student debt, and the data keeps coming out about defaults, there are no new significant regulatory changes being considered. The only things being talked about right now by lawmakers are “ensuring borrowers have the tools to manage their debt.”  At this point, the lawmakers are waiting to see how well the new rules work at keeping schools accountable, and that will take many years.   Plus, some of the new regulations could potentially even be undone under a Republican administration.
  What if they cut funding to these schools?   That won’t happen.  Nobody wants to prevent the millions of legitimate, current and future students of these schools from having access to education. These schools are too valuable to our educational system, as indicated in the government’s own report, and serve too many students to be targeted for more fundamental changes.  
  Enrollment is declining: Yes, it has been declining for the past couple years.  The new rules and the schools’ new focus on student retention and student outcomes has obviously made it impossible to take all the students they were taking before -- which is for the best.  And the recession has made potential students much more reluctant to invest in a new career without known job prospects.  However, enrollment declines have already stopped at some of the best schools.  APOL actually grew last quarter, and ESI thinks they will flat line next quarter, or at least be close to it. As we anniversary last year’s and this year’s declines, we can already see where the winners are going to level out.  Others, like some of the offerings from COCO and EDMC for example, without defensible market positions, brand names, physical locations, or economic product offerings will disappear, as intended.
  The new regulations will hurt their profitability. Yes. The results actually already reflect it though – keeping in mind that each year’s enrollment class shows up in results for several years.
  Existing schools are starting to compete more, especially online: Their offerings are simply not significant, especially for trade skills.
  But student loan data keeps getting worse: Yes, that is true for everybody, not just for-profits.  As long as unemployment stays high, many people won’t be able to pay their loans, regardless what school they went to.  The problems in this country with expensive tuition are in no way unique to for-profits.  Not to mention, that on a static pool basis, the last couple years of loan delinquencies at for-profits are much better than three years ago – which appears likely to remain the industry’s worst.
  What’s to like now? 
  It turns out, for the winners, right now, pretty much everything.
  1)   Industry: Lost in all the noise about the problems with the industry, is the bigger picture: this is a growing, dynamic industry that is at the forefront of a revolution in education in this country.
  -       Not only do these schools have a place in education, they are actually the future of it in many ways.  The high price of many universities in this country has spurred a reassessment of priorities for many people, and for-profits are filling the enormous holes in our educational system.
-       A large and growing population of students entering the education market – particularly working adults, part-time students, and students with children – are increasingly demanding the kinds of services offered by these schools: flexible scheduling with year-round enrollment, online options and better use of technology in every aspect of student life, small class sizes and convenient locations.
-       More students are recognizing the need for real world trade skills and are getting increasingly “realistic” about education and job prospects.  ESI offers trade skills and job specific programs not available at “normal” schools, e.g. homeland security, health IT, drafting and design, corrections, and electronics technology. 
-       Growth at ESI and other for-profits has not just been about “deceptive marketing.” Enrollment has been growing about 6% annually at for-profit schools for the past 20 years – 225% cumulatively. Today these institutions enroll about 12 percent of all postsecondary students, about 2.4 million as of 2010-2011 academic year. It’s actually the expensive, undistinguished, mostly liberal arts universities that face an uncertain future.
-       Even in the most critical government reports about these schools, they acknowledge the indispensable role for-profits are playing both in educating students and in shaping the industry.
  2)   Product: despite all the negative publicity, most of these schools have a great product and their students tend to be extremely pleased with their degree and their schools. Talk to employers.  Read the surveys conducted of different schools’ graduates.
  3)   Competitive Tuition:  despite the mostly misguided criticism of their high tuition, they actually charge way less than most private universities.  These schools are generally priced “around” the cost of state universities, about $18K per year.  This is much lower than the $50K per year it costs for a potentially equally “worthless” degree from all the second- and third-tier private non-profit universities in this country.  Yes, more expensive than community colleges, but that’s not a fair, or relevant, comparison most of the time.
  -       For all the criticism about student debt problems aimed at these schools, it seems strange not to mention the millions of people in this country burdened with the same debt from State Schools or from even more expensive “non-profit” schools.   Few have been so critical of the annual double digit tuition increases we’ve seen at practically every university across the country for the past decade.
  4)   Accountability: unlike a normal non-profit university, for-profits are now fully accountable for their results (and the trade schools tended to be the whole time).  The value proposition is very clear to prospective students. 
  -       The schools now have to tell prospective students the average salary and job placement rate for all recent graduating classes, for every major.  I don’t know of many “normal” universities that tell prospective students these things.
-       For-profits tend to have a much more comprehensive enrollment-to-job-placement system in place than most normal universities.
-       For-profits continually design and offer classes based on specific jobs, and then cultivate local employer relationships. They continually monitor real world needs, and quickly and efficiently design and offer classes to fill those needs.  How many non-profit universities offer courses for jobs in homeland security? And how long would it take to implement if they wanted to?
  5)   Positive Impact of New Regulations: While the new regulations governing for-profit schools have had a negative effect on enrollment, they are having the intended consequences. Schools seem to be getting more accountable, they claim that persistence is creeping up and defaults have been getting better across the industry the last two years.  In time, these things will also help change sentiment toward the industry.
  -       Keeping dropouts down will also begin to offset some of the lost revenue from lower enrollment and added expenses of student support.
  6)   Enrollment trends. The new regulations have now been finalized for over a year, and the industry had been preparing for them for a couple years previously.  For the industry winners with the right product offerings and student support, ESI and APOL for example, business is already stabilizing. Accomplishing this in the face of all the negative attention and still high unemployment is a remarkable testament to the strength of the industry. (Though other companies, like EDMC, may never recover.)
   7)   Business models.  These schools produce an enormous amount of cash. They have low cap ex, and low or no working capital, so earnings are usually all cash.  And when they are growing, due to the negative working capital created by the front-loaded tuition, they produce even more cash than earnings.  And without any use for the cash, they tend to buy back a lot of stock or, like STRA, pay a big dividend.

  I would also add “receivables” to cash.  These are loans to students to make up the difference of what other loans and grants don’t cover.   These are interest bearing and net of allowances.  And even if you don’t want to give them credit for these investments as cash, it doesn’t matter, because they are in the process of finalizing a new third part loan facility that will be making these loans.  Their receivable balance will then be sold for cash to this facility, or run off, and the new facility will be making these loans.  Either way, this cash will show up on the balance sheet (and they will lose the interest income).  They also made another $2/share in the quarter that ends September 30, so we can add that to cash too.
  Adjusting for cash, receivables, and this quarter’s net income:
  Adjusted Price: $26.50
  Adjusted 2012 P/E: 3.2x
Adjusted 2012 P/E: 3.4x
  ESI has bought back 38% of their stock in the last 2.5 years alone.  They have literally spent every dollar of their net income for the past four and a half years buying back stock.  But they haven’t previously had a chance to buy back stock at 3x earnings. So, the impact will be enormous if they keep doing it.
  In one year, ESI will have 43% of its stock price in cash. In two years, they will have 68% of their stock price in cash. If they continue to buy back stock, they will have no shares left outstanding in just over three years.  The stock could go up 25% tomorrow and the P/E would still only be 4x.
  And all of that is before we consider the fact that we are probably at the secular bottom, cyclical bottom, political bottom, loan default bottom, job market bottom, publicity bottom, and earnings bottom.
  And 35% of the float is currently short. Which keeps going up, simply with the buy-backs.
  Catalyst:
  The valuation alone is the catalyst. Plus the cash piling up and share buy-backs.  
  Also, if enrollment flattens this quarter or next as expected, if the economy picks up, or if the media simply stops reacting hysterically every time new student loan data comes out, the stock will probably triple.  If it ever comes out that these schools are actually doing a great job, all hell could break loose.
                                I do not hold a position of employment, directorship, or consultancy with the issuer.

Grupo Aeroportuario del Centro Norte (which I shall henceforth refer to as OMA) is one of three publicly-traded airport operators in Mexico (the other two I’ll refer to as GAP and ASUR).  Airports in Mexico are good businesses.  They are high-growth, inflation-protected monopolies.
  The “inflation-protected monopolies” part I’ll elaborate a bit more on in the section entitled “Background on the Airport Industry in Mexico.”  As for the high-growth part, it’s not complicated.  Air travel in general is a growth business, because as uncomfortable as flying may be, people still like to travel more so long as they can afford it.  Since 1970, worldwide air passenger volumes have grown at a 6% CAGR (CAGR is the same for the last 10 years).
  Air travel growth in Mexico should be even higher than it is for the world as a whole.  Mexico has all the ingredients needed to be a high-growth market for air travel.  It’s not a compact country – it’s a nearly 50 hour drive from Cancun to Tijuana.  Over the last decade it’s developed a robust low-cost carrier presence, with airlines like Volaris pricing not only to steal share from legacy carriers but also to get bus passengers to switch to air.  And air travel is still relatively underpenetrated among Mexicans – Mexicans take an average of 0.3 air trips per person per year, as compared to 0.5 in Brazil and 2.4 in the U.S.
  Over the last five years, the three publicly-traded airports in Mexico have seen their aggregate passenger volumes (for Mexican airports only) grow at a 10% CAGR.  Year-to-date through the first quarter, volumes are up 9%.

  With an investor-friendly dual-till regulatory framework in place (see “Background on Airport Industry in Mexico” for more detail), Mexico’s airports have been able to convert high volume growth into excellent EBITDA and FCF growth:
Data from company filings.  Mexican CPI used for computing real growth figures. EBITDA figures above exclude EBITDA from OMA’s hotels and industrial park, ASUR’s Puerto Rican and Columbian airports, and GAP’s Jamaican airport (I excluded EBITDA from these sources to present apples-to-apples organic data).

Data from company filings.  FCF can by lumpy from year-to-year depending on timing of expansion capex.
  The investment thesis isn’t complex – I don’t have any particularly clever observations.  I just think the Mexican airports are especially good businesses that are likely to compound earnings at at least mid-to-high single digit real rates for many years, and OMA in particular trades at a reasonable valuation:

Data from company filings.  Based on closing prices as of 4/12/18 and LTM financials as of 12/31/17 (with exception of CAAP, for which I only have financials through 9/30/17).
  Why is OMA trading at low multiples relative to both other airports and its own trading history?  One factor surely is Trump’s election and concern about NAFTA’s future.  The Mexican airports all saw their multiples drop quickly in the aftermath of Trump’s victory.  OMA in particular is more exposed to NAFTA disruptions than the other Mexican airports.  Manufacturing is key to the region OMA serves, and OMA’s most important airport is Monterrey, which accounts for about half of the company’s passenger volumes and revenues.  These parts of Mexico would likely be impacted more severely than others in the event of trade restrictions.  And unlike ASUR (which operates the Cancun airport among others) and GAP (which operates the airports in Los Cabos and Puerto Vallarta among others), OMA doesn’t have much tourist traffic to soften the blow of domestic weakness (international passengers make up less than 15% of OMA traffic versus a third at GAP and more than half at ASUR).
  Another factor likely contributing to OMA’s low multiples is a slowdown in passenger volumes, as traffic at OMA’s airports only grew 1.5% in the second half of 2017.  In the summer of 2017, the capacity-constrained government-operated Mexico City airport introduced some slot restrictions that compelled airlines to cancel some flights to smaller airports.  In addition, Aeromexico decided to swap out its smaller Embraer 145s with Embraer 190s (which don’t operate at smaller airports).  As OMA is disproportionately exposed to smaller airports, these two factors hit OMA much harder than GAP and ASUR.  These headwinds should stop blowing in 2Q18 and 3Q18 as OMA begins facing easier comps.  For what it’s worth, OMA’s traffic growth has rebounded a bit and is up 8% YTD through 1Q18 (note that Easter, which occurred in April of last year but March of this year, flatters the 1Q18 figure).
  A third issue is the weak financial health of Mexican low-cost carrier Interjet, which represents about 20% of OMA’s traffic.  Should Interjet go out of business, that will clearly impact OMA in the near-term, although eventually the supply provided by Interjet should be replaced by other airlines, just as it was when Mexicana, which represented a third of the Mexican airline market before its demise, went out of business in 2010. 
  Lastly, there is concern about the upcoming Mexican presidential election.  The favorite right now is Andres Manual Lopez Obrador (AMLO).  AMLO is leftist, which by itself tends to scare investors.  Moreover, AMLO has threatened to shut down construction of the new Mexico City airport.  As the existing Mexico City airport is already capacity constrained, a failure to open the new hub in the next few years is likely to depress overall Mexican air travel volumes (although OMA might get some more volumes in Monterrey as a substitute hub for Mexico City).  The existing regulatory framework for the publicly-traded Mexican airports has worked well – from what I gather these airports have better efficiency and lower tariffs than the government-operated airports – so I doubt there are major changes to the regulatory framework, regardless of who wins the election.
  Factoring this all in, I think OMA is a good investment.  At current prices, OMA (which you can own either via the Mexican-listed shares or via the US-listed ADR) is my favorite of the three, with GAP a close second.  ASUR is my least favorite of the bunch, largely because it has diversified into Puerto Rican and Columbian airport assets that I view as inferior to their core Mexican airport assets.
  Background on the Airport Industry in Mexico:
Prior to 1998, Mexico’s airports were government-owned.  Faced with the need to modernize and improve the nation’s airports, the government decided to privatize most of the industry.  The country’s airports were divided into 5 groups: GAP (12 airports on/near Pacific Coast), OMA (13 airports in North Central Mexico), ASUR (9 airports in Southeast Mexico), the Mexico City airport, and a 5th group of small airports deemed too unprofitable to privatize.
  The government granted 50-year concessions (expiring in 2048) to each group, and then auctioned off portions of GAP, OMA, and ASUR to private operators (Mexico City was initially supposed to be privatized but the transaction was never consummated – fast forward to 2018, and the Mexico City airport is considering an IPO).  In the year 2000, the government disposed of most of the rest of its stake in ASUR in that company’s IPO.  IPOs of GAP and OMA followed in 2006. 
  In conjunction with the privatization of GAP, OMA, and ASUR, Mexico introduced a relatively investor-friendly regulatory scheme.  Before I get into the details, I’ll go through “Airport Regulation 101” for those not already familiar with the industry.
  There are two basic revenue sources for airports: Aeronautical and Commercial.  Aeronautical revenues represent the “tariffs” that airlines pay the airport for usage of the airport (in Mexico, these fees typically range from 150-300 pesos, or ~$8-$15 in USD, per passenger).  Commercial revenues represent rents that stores/restaurants pay to operate in the terminals, as well as fees from parking, etc.  Given the captive audience in airports, commercial rents are usually steep; a typical rental contract requires a store or restaurant operators to pay either a guaranteed minimum rental amount, or a royalty (typically 20-40% of the operator’s sales), whichever is higher. 
  In most airports worldwide, tariffs (the fees airlines pay the airport) are regulated by the government under utility-like frameworks that aim to ensure the airports achieve “fair” returns based on capital deployed.  But there are significant differences among the regulatory frameworks used by different countries.  Under “single-till” regulatory schemes, regulators consider revenues from both Aeronautical and Commercial sources when setting tariffs.  In practice, that means that any extra money that an airport makes on the Commercial side just serves to reduce the tariffs that the airport can charge the airline.  It also means that airport margins are effectively capped under single-till regulation.
  Under “dual-till” regulatory schemes, regulators only consider revenue from Aeronautical sources when setting tariffs.  The revenues (and high incremental profits) from Commercial sources are additive.  Airports operating under “dual-till” regulation typically grow margins over time. 
  Given that I already described Mexico’s airports as benefitting from “investor-friendly” regulation, you can probably guess that Mexican airports operate under a dual-till framework.  That is the case, but that is not the only reason to like the Mexican airport regulatory scheme from an investor perspective.
  Each Mexican airport operator operates under a 5-year regulatory cycle (these cycles are staggered – ASUR’s next regulatory cycle starts in 2019, GAP’s starts in 2020, and OMA’s starts in 2021).  Every 5 years, an airport operator submits a Master Development Plan (MDP) outlining expected volumes and proposed capex for the next 5 years, and the government sets tariffs for the next 5 years largely based on the MDP inputs.   Importantly however, the allowable tariffs can and do change over the course of each 5-year regulatory cycle.  Tariffs can be adjusted upwards if Mexican GDP falls more than 5% in a 6-month period and/or in the event of natural disasters.  Even more importantly, the allowable tariffs set by the government are adjusted for inflation annually.  Adjusted for inflation, tariffs at OMA’s airports have grown at a 2% CAGR over the last 15 years (0% CAGR for GAP, -1% CAGR for ASUR).  On a nominal basis, this translated to a 7% CAGR for OMA’s airports (5% for GAP, 4% for ASUR). 
  This is why I describe Mexican airports as inflation-protected monopolies.  Aeronautical revenues are adjusted annually for inflation, and Commercial revenues naturally adjust for inflation because many commercial rental agreements in airports are structured as a % of the tenant’s sales.  (As for the monopoly part, airports are effective local monopolies since it’s very difficult and rare for a new airport to be built in an existing airport’s catchment area).
  One fly in the ointment is that, as I mentioned earlier, the concessions for Mexico’s airports expire in 2048.  I’m not sure what will happen then, but for the sake of conservatism, you should probably assume that the government takes back the concessions in 2048 and then re-auctions them off.  If you put on your academic hat, then that means the publicly-traded Mexican airports should be valued as annuities ending in 2048 (rather than perpetuities like most businesses).  In the discounted cash flow analyses I’ve done, using such an annuity calculation instead of a perpetuity calculation slices about 25% off the per-share values of the Mexican airport stocks.

I think U.S. Global (“USG”) will report over $5mm in earnings this fourth quarter due to an unknown $3.5mm incentive fee accrual that is due USG from a firm called Endeavor Mining Capital (“EDV”). While this information doesn’t show up in any of USG’s public documents, Endeavor happens to be publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange and one can figure it out by reading EDV’s latest Q3 filing. While I don’t think this “information edge” is of the same magnitude as my original USG posting (AUM really 40% higher than what was reported), it is still significant for a company with an enterprise value of $130mm. This would put USG’s 2006 earnings over $10mm or 13x EV/E which is much too low given USG’s past and prospective growth. I think shares will trade at least in the mid-20’s after earnings are released giving those interested in a 2 month trade (earning out in September) a meaningful AACR. Fortunately, I think this “trade” is also a quality long term investment and will update some of my thinking since my original write up.
  The “Trade”: Background
  Endeavour Mining Capital is publicly traded merchant banking company that is focused on the global natural resources sector. Frank Holmes, the CEO of USG, was recently appointed as Chairman of Endeavour and was able to get USG appointed as manager of EDV’s $180mm -$200mm portfolio (it has been very lucrative to both sides thus far). The fee structure is 2 and 20 with an 8% hurdle. The fees get split evenly between USG and EDV. The chart below lays out the economics for USG at $180mm AUM.

    The USG/EDV relationship officially March 1st (the beginning of EDV’s Q) so USG’s latest quarter only included one month’s worth of management fees. Below is what is reported regarding EDV in USG’s last 10-Q.
    “In the third quarter of fiscal year 2006, the Company began providing investment advisory services to Endeavour Mining Capital Corp., an offshore company. The Company is paid a monthly management fee based on the net asset value of the portfolio and an annual performance fee, if any, based on a percentage of consolidated net income from operations in excess of a predetermined percentage return on equity. The Company recorded $106,230 in management fees for the three months ended March 31, 2006. Holmes is a member and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Endeavour Mining Capital Corp.”
To find the performance fee, one has to look at EDV’s latest 10-Q where for the 3 months ending May 2006, a $9.5mm performance fee is reported. EDV accrues the performance fee and reports the accrual on a quarterly basis.
  http://www.endeavourminingcapital.com/uploads/EDVPressReleaseQ3EarningsFinal.pdf
  USG’s policy is to only book its portion of the “annual performance fee” once EDV’s annual books are closed and audited (which is why mgmt fee for one month was the only item disclosed). USG is entitled to half this $9.5mm but there are a couple of items that need to be noted. First, the timing of USG’s recognition is unclear as EDV is changing their fiscal year to June.  According to Holmes, if EDV’s audit is completed in time, USG will recognize its share of the performance fee this quarter (what they are shooting for obviously, if not, you will see it in September). Second, there is one more month of EDV performance that will be included and that is June when EDV’s NAV went down 3% (so the $9.5mm will be a little bit less but remember that there will also be a $450K management fee for April, May and June).
  The “Trade”: Do others know this?
  For what it is worth, I don’t think others have put this information together. The stock price of USG has actually gone down since EDV’s released this information. Additionally, you will not find this on any of the message boards (see aggregator instantbull.com). Because USG’s stock price has done so well, the IBD crowd has joined the party which makes the stock extremely volatile (hit 28 after last quarter earnings and has come all the way down to 18) and a large portion of the shareholder base are unsophisticated, momentum players. This makes USG a wonderful stock to trade (if this happens to be your thing.)
Investment thesis:
  For those interested in the longer term here, I think the story is compelling at this price:

    While the stock price has come down over 30% since the middle of May, assets under management have only come down around 10%. Most importantly, this decrease has been driven by performance and not outflows. My AUM estimate for July has USG assets going up from $4.6 billion as of the end of June to $4.75 billion as of the end of July. If you look at the chart above, you will see that despite the recent market correction, the YTD performance of USG’s funds has been stellar. You will also see that YTD inflows have totaled almost $1 billion with the two full fee funds, natural resource and precious metals, taking the bulk of the flows. Holmes had been quoted earlier in the year when the market was going crazy as saying that they were receiving $10mm a day in inflows. My number suggests this has tempered a bit and the average for the year is closer to $6mm. Ultimately, I think owners of USG can go to bed at night with a smile on their face knowing that inflows of capital are trickling in to their company when measured over a 3-5 year timeframe. This thesis is supported by several facts:
  Performance – When screening for the best performing mutual funds over a five year period, USG has four of the top five funds (out of 7,000+ funds) as of June 30, 2006. And they only have 13 funds total!
More exposure of the brand – Frank Holmes is appearing on CNBC and Bloomberg more regularly and the firm has increasing gotten more and more written press. We are still in the early innings.
Past numbers suggest inflow assumption makes sense.

    Above are USG’s last four quarters and my estimate of $2mm for this quarters “core earnings.” Core earnings have been stripped of proprietary trading and represent earnings from the mutual fund business earnings (and an immaterial amount from hedge fund management fees) that can be used for forecasting purposes. I get to the over $5mm 4Q number, by taking half of the $9.5mm incentive fee taxed at 38% (a conservative estimate – the tax rate could very well be a blend of long term and short term rates) and adding the management fee of $450,000. This $3.4mm combined with the $2mm of “core earnings”, gets you over $5mm. 
  2007 Earnings:
  If you assume that AUM holds steady at the June average for the entire 2007 period, you have around $8mm in earnings power from the mutual fund business and $2.3mm in earnings from the hedge fund business assuming zero incentive fees. This gives you $10mm in earnings on a $130mm EV or an 8% FCF yield. I think this is a bargain given USG’s growth profile, long term rates, and the conservative assumptions that went in the projection. This number has substantial upside if you factor in positive net inflows or positive hedge fund performance.

USG has a blow out quarter coming and I don’t think “the street” knows it.

We believe Boston Beer Co. Inc. (NYSE:SAM) is substantially overvalued at current prices, and is set to implode in the second half of the year.
  Opportunity
  In the 10Q for the quarter ending 31 March 2012, SAM guided 6-9% depletions growth. The most recent Nielsen data, as of June 9, indicates SAM’s beer volumes are down 6.5% in AOC data (which covers approximately 50% of volume and includes grocery, drug, and mass market channels). In order for SAM to meet guidance, growth through remaining channels (bar/restaurant, convenience stores) will need to be close to 20%. We do not think those growth rates are achievable. SAM may reduce guidance, catalyzing a fall in the share price. (Sources: 3,6)

  The stock has moved up 26% in the last twelve months (as of 19 July 2012). SAM is good but not special. Would you pay 26.5x earnings for a company with 6% volume growth, assuming management can meet its target? The only way to support the current valuation from a fundamentals perspective is to believe that the craft beer segment will become thirty percent or more of the total US beer market and that SAM can maintain its position as the largest craft brewer by a significant margin. Let’s examine the beer industry first.
  Beer Industry
  The domestic beer market is $95.5B/year. Volume growth has been slow or negative over the last ten years, and a growing US population has masked a steady decline in beer consumption per capita. The major brewers are still losing share with ABI volume share down 40bp and MillerCoors down 80bp in 2011 on volume changes of -3.0% and -3.2%, respectively. The bright spot has been the craft beer segment, which has growing steadily since 2005, including 13.2% volume growth and 14.7% sales growth in 2011. Craft beer’s market share by volume was 5.7% in 2011 and 9.1% by sales. (Sources: 1,11)

  Craft Beer Competition
  Competition in the craft beer space has increased dramatically and will continue to do so. The number of breweries in the US fell steadily from a high of 1,751 in 1900 to less than 100 in the 1980s, but has rebounded over the last two decades, climbing to over 2,000 in 1Q2012. There were an additional 915 applications for brewing licenses in 2011, which will lead to even more players entering a space which we believe is becoming saturated. One newcomer, Revolution Brewing, is expanding in Chicago with a new brewery in 2012 that has initial capacity of 25,000 barrels/year and eventual capacity of 100,000 barrels/year. (Sources: 7,11)
  While the little guys are bringing competitive pressure from the bottom, the big players are pushing their own faux craft beers, bringing pressure from the top.  MillerCoors’ Blue Moon label is the single biggest craft beer in the country. ABI is looking to replicate Blue Moon’s success with its recent acquisition of Goose Island. In the alternative space, Blue Moon is rolling out a caramel apple spiced ale this summer. (Sources: 8,12)
  On top of the pressure from the start-ups and the giants, the established craft brewers are ramping up competition for each other’s market share. Western craft brewers are pushing east into SAM’s home market. California-based Sierra Nevada is building a 300,000 barrel brewery in Asheville, CA. Colorado-based New Belgium is building a 400,000 barrel brewery, also in Asheville, NC. At the same time, Yeungling, a lower price regional brewer that is dominant in Pennsylvania with 2.5M barrel/year production, has moved into Ohio with plans for further expansion. Portland-based Craft Brew Alliance has targeted Chicago for its expansion. In the middle of this competitive field, SAM is betting on expansion westward out of New England to find its own growth.

    Recent growth has been unhealthy. Twisted Tea and Seasonals accounted for 70% of SAM’s growth in 2011 (see table below). Recent SAM volume and sales growth has come from filling distribution channels for Twisted Tea and meeting temporary demand for the Alpine Spring seasonal.
  In regards to Twisted Tea, distribution channels are filling, suggesting growth will slow in the near term. Even in the case that Twisted Tea achieves equal distribution to Mike’s Hard Lemonade and Smirnoff Ice, distribution growth would slow y/y. (Source: 14)
  In regards to Seasonals, Alpine Spring was a new variety, while the remainder of the 2012 Seasonals (Summer Ale, Oktoberfest, Winter Ale) are unchanged, suggesting the boost in growth from a new spring Seasonal will not be realized for the remainder of the year. (Source: 14)

    Summary
  The overall beer industry has not been growing, and per capita beer consumption is in a structural decline. The craft beer space has been growing, and will grow for a while longer, but craft beer won’t go from 5.7% to 30% of all beer sold. Furthermore, increasing competition will mean SAM won’t maintain as dominant of a position. SAM’s strategy is to expand westward, but Colorado and other western states already have local craft beers that they are loyal to. The western craft beer companies are already eating into SAM’s market share in SAM’s home territory on the East Coast, while the majors push their own faux crafts, and Yeungling tries to go national. Additionally, with the flagship Boston Lager flat to down, a slowdown in Twisted Tea or Seasonals will significantly impact sales growth, driving down multiples.
  Conclusion
  The assumptions needed to justify SAM’s valuation are unreasonable. The craft beer competition is intensifying. SAM’s growth will be flat to negative, with appropriate multiples for that kind of growth near 13x. Assuming $4 in earnings, we have a target share price of $52.
  Risks
  Acquisition by a major is a risk. However, Goose Island was acquired in 2011 by Anheuser-Busch for $38.8M , or 11.8x earnings, significantly below SAMs current P/E multiple of 26.5x. Stock buyback by the company is also a risk, although it is mitigated by the fact that the company only has $18.8M remaining on their $275M repurchase authorization, as of 27 April 2012. A further mitigation to the buyback risk is that management did not do a significant amount of buyback at stock prices 15% below current. (Sources: 6,10)

Odyssey Marine Exploration
A Sea Change in Opportunity and Risk goes Unappreciated 
  Odyssey Marine Exploration, (OMEX as is it is know on the NASDAQ) probably should not be a public company; but it has been and it is.  Odyssey’s business (as least as of yet) is not recurring, periods are not comparable, and many standard business valuation metrics are irrelevant.  That said, Odyssey is a company addressing multiple large economic opportunities with unique technology, strong intellectual property, and extensive experience that cannot be easily duplicated by others.  While, the past has been difficult, we believe that an investment in Odyssey common equity is now compelling.
  Odyssey was born out of treasure hunting:  searching for and recovering the valuables from historical shipwrecks.  Today, however, Odyssey has transformed itself into a diversified company with multiple lines of business.  Odyssey’s experience, technology, and expertise surveying the deep ocean floor and recovering materials from miles below the sea have broadened Odyssey’s opportunities.  In addition to Historical Shipwrecks, Odyssey is pursuing Modern Shipwrecks holding valuable commodities and the Exploration and Mining of Minerals from under the sea.
  While Odyssey has not been a disaster for shareholders over the past ten years, the past six years have been difficult for most involved.  In 2003, Odyssey achieved a moderate success with the salvage of the SS Republic, a Civil War era wreck yielding over 50,000 coins and 14,000 artifacts from nearly 1,700 feet below the surface of the ocean.  Odyssey then delayed a salvage of the HMS Sussex (off the coast of Gibraltar in partnership with the United Kingdom) to pursue a project OMEX code named “Black Swan”. 
  Not going into too many details of the “Black Swan” project (you can read a summary here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Swan_Project); in short, in 2007, Odyssey recovered a treasure from an unidentified wreck and/or wrecks that was estimated to be worth over $500 million.  Odyssey transported the treasure to the U.S. and filed in the U.S. Courts for an arrest of cargo to establish a legal claim. 
  Under various international maritime laws and conventions, 85-100% of recovered salvage is awarded to the salvage firm.  However, Spain sued to claim the entire ownership of the cargo, asserting it was from the wreck of the Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes.  Spain refused to pay any salvage award arguing all the assets recovered from the Mercedes were protected by sovereign immunity.  Cables released by Wikileaks point to the U.S. Government conspiring with the Spanish Government to relieve Odyssey of the haul. 
  Regardless of the maritime law details, and the merits of the case, Odyssey, after a long court fight, lost the treasure in 2012, the cost of the salvage effort and the expense of the court battles that ensued.  (The Spanish are still after Odyssey for their court costs as well.)  Furthermore, the animosity with the Spanish Government has prevented Odyssey from pursuing the Sussex because it lies in (potentially disputed) waters off Gibraltar.
  Odyssey survived the difficult period between 2007 and 2012 primarily through equity dilution and project level financings.   This allowed Odyssey to continue operating, albeit at significant cost to existing shareholders.  The visible scars include a doubling of the basic share count over the past decade to almost 80 million (79.625 million shares exactly), and Net Operating Loss Carryforwards that stand at $129 million.  The less visible scars include a short interest that amounts to 19% of the float, several legacy project financing arrangements that leak some value out of future projects and a host of burned investors who likely consider Odyssey an expensive E-ticket ride akin to Pirates of the Caribbean.
  We, however, believe Odyssey is an attractive investment today because, despite the setbacks of the past six years, the opportunity is real.  Odyssey’s wreck identification capabilities are proven.  And, recently, Odyssey’s recovery of 110 tons of silver from the SS Gairsoppa, three miles below the ocean surface, proves its recovery technologies and capabilities are profound.  Odyssey has unique technology; capabilities and experience that create a competitive advantage and a true moat around its business. 
  To date, Odyssey’s greatest vulnerabilities have been its risk taking, capital structure, and reliance on only the volatile and controversial historical shipwreck business.  However, Odyssey’s corporate governance and management approach has evolved following the Black Swan.  Odyssey has changed its legal risk threshold for pursuing salvage opportunities.  Previously, Odyssey was willing to rely on maritime law to ensure they could legally claim ownership of tremendously valuable salvage.  Their experience with the Black Swan has circumscribed that belief, and now, Odyssey is focused on projects where they have an upfront contract with whoever was the last owner of the target cargo; thereby eliminating a significant legal risk.  Odyssey will also pursue targets without any potential claimants.  Most deals seem to be structured with Odyssey bearing the expense of salvage, then being reimbursed for those expenses from any recovery.  Any recovery in excess of project costs are typically split 80/20 or 90/10 in Odyssey’s favor.
  The success of the Gairsoppa has validated Odyssey capabilities and established a cash balance from which Odyssey can fund its business plan without dilution.
  Finally and most importantly, Odyssey has expanded its business activities beyond Historical Shipwrecks to modern Commodity Shipwrecks, and Undersea Mineral Exploration and Mining.  Odyssey has also diversified its operations geographically so that salvage operations will be conducted year round as opposed to only in the North Atlantic’s temperate summer months.
  We believe the commodity shipwreck business alone can justify today’s market cap.  If you give Odyssey credit for their equity stakes in several undersea mineral exploration and mining ventures, you are one or two moderately successful salvage projects away from getting Odyssey’s business for free.  Both the Mineral Exploration and Historical Shipwreck business have the potential for finds worth multiples of Odyssey’s current market cap.
  Odyssey is engaged in three lines of business:  Historical Shipwreck Recovery, Modern Commodity Shipwreck Recovery, and Undersea Mineral exploration and Mining.  Odyssey conducts its shipwreck recovery search and salvage operations from the Odyssey Explorer, its owned 251 foot Class II dynamically positioning ship.  Odyssey also will charter other vessels, as was done with the SS Gairsoppa, if the situations requires.  Odyssey conducts its underwater mineral exploration activity from the Dorado Discovery, a specially equipped over 300 foot vessel under long term lease to Odyssey.
  Historical Shipwreck Recovery:  Research, location, and recovery of cargo from historical shipwrecks with cargo values in excess of $50 million.   According to Odyssey, There are scores of shipwrecks above US $50 million in value, with the most valuable projects approaching $500 million to $1 billion.   The rewards and risks here are massive as demonstrated by the Black Swan project.  
  It is difficult to price long term, out of the money options.  However, if the commodity shipwreck business builds on its recent successes, the series of options embedded in the historical shipwreck business become significantly more valuable.
  Odyssey needs to demonstrate success with a historical shipwreck recovery (in cooperation with an owner) for investors to properly discount future potential cash flows from this business.  That said, a single recovery could be worth twice the company’s market capitalization and some option value probably is warranted, but not priced in.
  Currently, Odyssey is waiting for the go ahead from the UK Ministry of Defense (MOD) to commence the salvage and archeological excavation of the HMS Victory wreck.  The HMS Victory was the preeminent ship of its time when in 1744 it was lost to a storm in the English Channel. 
  Some estimate Victory’s cargo could be worth in excess of $1 billion.  A previous Odyssey investor presentation suggests that $250 million is reasonable.  Odyssey’s contract with the UK Government stipulates Odyssey will receive reimbursement of its project costs, 80% of the value of the coin and commercial cargo and 50% of the value of any artifacts recovered.   Mitigating the opportunity somewhat is Odyssey’s project financing agreement with Galt Resources, LLC (an entity controlled by John Morris, Odyssey’s former CEO).  Under the agreement (by which Odyssey raised $7.5 million in 2011), Odyssey must pay Galt 50% of the first $30 million of Odyssey’s net proceeds from the Victory and 7.51% thereafter.  Assuming the recovery from the Victory is $250 million and project costs are $20 million (benefited by the shallow location, ability to use the Odyssey Explorer, offset by the time and care required by archeological obligations), Odyssey’s profit after paying Galt would be over $150 million.  A $50 million recovery would net Odyssey $12 million, whereas a $1 billion treasure would net Odyssey over $700 million.      
  As has been typical of these historical shipwreck projects, there is significant political and cultural opposition to the commercialization of a “gravesite”, and the “nation’s history”.  Odyssey’s argument in favor of the project focuses on the damage being done to the sites by scavengers, the environment, and modern seaborne commercial activity.  Most importantly, the commercial salvage will fund a thorough archeological excavation of the wreck to preserve the Victory’s story and artifacts for all to learn from and enjoy.
  Approval for the HMS Victory has been delayed by other UK government priorities, and politics.  A September 2012 Odyssey investor presentation suggested final UK government response was expected shortly.  Since then twelve months have passed with little news beyond a December 2012 debate in the House of Lords on the merit of the project and soft reassurances from Odyssey that the project is still expected to be given a green light. 
  The approval could be announced tomorrow or never.  We do not know what is going on behind the scenes.  However, only the go ahead would likely pop the stock 10-20%.  Just as important as the economic value of the Victory, a combined commercial and archeological success would likely bring other countries and projects to the table with Odyssey.
  In addition to the HMS Victory, Odyssey is constantly updating its research on potential target locations, cargo values and risks.  Odyssey has developed a database of thousands of wrecks; cataloging cargo information, location information, and legal information.  This should continue to yield attractive targets for years to come.
Specifically, Odyssey has asserted they will pursue 1-3 additional historical shipwreck recoveries over the next couple years.
  Commodity Shipwreck Recovery:  Research, location, and salvage of high value modern (typically 20th century) commodity shipwrecks.  Commodity shipwrecks typically offer smaller targets than historical shipwrecks.  However, the recent ship losses and salvage contracts, with relatively minimal cultural resource issues allow for lower risk projects.  Odyssey’s SS Gairsoppa project (salvage conducted in the summers of 2012 and 2013) is a proof of concept.  Enabled by the experience and technology Odyssey gathered over the past fifteen years researching, locating and excavating historical shipwrecks, Odyssey located the wreck of the SS Gairsoppa quickly, and over two expeditions recovered 110 tons of silver from 15,000 feet below sea level.
  Odyssey believes there are scores of shipwrecks worth more than $20 million, with some worth as much as $100-200 million.  Depending on the difficulty of recovery, the financial model can be compelling.  We estimate the SS Gairsoppa project (in total) yielded approximately $84 million in gross cash flows on outlays of approximately $25-30 million.  Odyssey’s operating profit (before its project financing deal with Galt Resources LLC) is estimated to be over $40 million after approximately $30 million spent and far less actually risked (i.e. they would not have spent as much on salvage if the project was not yielding material).

  Odyssey says that it currently has over 25 targets in its commodity wreck pipeline with an estimated recovery value of approximately $800 million.  Odyssey’s announced commodity wreck pipeline currently consists of four World War II era wrecks containing non-precious metal cargo such as tin and nickel.  The cargos were estimated to be worth over $230 million in September 2012 and are estimated to be worth $184 million at today’s prices (per Odyssey’s June 30th 10Q).  Odyssey has not given much detail out about the targets other than to explain the recoveries are believed to be less complex than the Gairsoppa.  Because the silver on the Gairsoppa was hidden and represented only 2% of the gross tonnage of the vessel, it was difficult to find.  The commodity metals on these next four targets are located in the main cargo hulls and represent 52% (on average) of the gross tonnage of the vessels (i.e. you find the ships and you’ve found the valuable cargo).  While Odyssey spent most of the Gairsoppa project searching the wreck for the 110 tons of insured silver and the uninsured silver alleged to be on board but never found; the commodity metal project will be more heavy lifting of the 13,000 metric tons of metal from the ocean. Given that salvage costs are directly related to time at sea, the small time needed to locate cargo should make costs much more variable to the material recovered.
  To model the financial impact we have made several assumptions:
  $15 million salvage cost on successful vessels ($100K per day for 150 days), $3 million salvage costs on unsuccessful vessels ($100k per day for 30m days).  We believe this is likely to prove conservative both in cost per day and time required.
For example purposes we are also assuming identical cargo values for each vessel because we do not know the distribution, and 5% smelting and other costs (60% more than with the silver from Gairsoppa). 
  A $184 million recovery (i.e. success with all four vessels) would yield $124 million in gross profits to the Odyssey/Owner partnership and approximately $103 million to Odyssey.  A scenario where two vessels for some reason yielded no salvage, and recoveries were $92 million would yield $56 million in gross profits and approximately $46 million to Odyssey.  Given that we are estimating salvage costs to be $12-$60 million, there are likely to be significant project financing expenses (although some of this can be ameliorated by sequencing the projects, and asset based financing once recovery is assured). 
  All that said, $46 to $103 million of potential next 12-24 months project level operating profits are immense for a company with a $250 million market cap and an enterprise value around $60 million.   Yes, there is the possibility of a loss, but it is not the most likely scenario.  Furthermore, Odyssey believes that there are other targets not requiring salvage agreements that can be added to the program and undertaken while Odyssey has a ship nearby.  Work is targeted to begin in 2013.

  Skeptics might point to the failure of Odyssey to recover any silver from the SS Mantola in the summer of 2013.  Our response is that Odyssey addressed the Mantola with only the remainder of time from its charter hired to salvage the Gairsoppa.  Given the low cargo value (~$12 million), limited time, and small size of the cargo (i.e. it was silver ingots not beams of tin) we do not believe the comparison is relevant.
  Undersea Mineral Exploration and Mining: 
  Several years ago, Odyssey began to provide exploration services to several early stage underwater mineral exploration companies.  Odyssey believes mining minerals from the ocean floor will be a large opportunity.  From Odyssey’s website:
  Nearly 100% of the minerals and metals consumed today come from land-based mines. However, metal concentrations from sample deposits of recovered seafloor rock are significantly higher than those mined commercially around the world from onshore sites. And these deep-sea deposits can be extracted in a more economically efficient and environmentally friendly manner than in traditional land-based mines
  Seafloor Massive Sulfide (SMS) deposits are naturally occurring deposits that contain high concentrations of gold, copper, zinc, silver and other metals in relatively compact areas. Although their existence is possible anywhere that new ocean crust has formed, the highest grade deposits have been found at convergent plate margins and earthquake-prone areas especially in the waters of the South Pacific, New Zealand and Japan.
  We know in addition to Seafloor Massive Sulfides, Odyssey and other exploration companies are focused on phosphates, valuable for use in fertilizer.
  Odyssey has created tremendous value from its Undersea Mineral Exploration activities.  In working with exploration and mining companies, Neptune Minerals, Inc. and Chatham Rock Phosphate, Odyssey has charged its expenses in cash and taken equity as upside for its services.   More recently, Odyssey has leveraged its capabilities to undertake undersea mineral exploration as a principal through a subsidiary called Oceanica Resources.  Over the past 24 months, Odyssey has invested $26 million in exploration activities using its ship the Dorado Discovery; generated $40.3 million in cash from fees and sales of equity as well as built up equity positions with a current private market value of $179 million.
  According to Odyssey there are likely hundreds of ore deposits at the bottom of the ocean with a net present value above $500 million, with many worth billions. 
Odyssey currently has stakes in three companies and will continue to attempt identify and develop other deposits.
  Neptune Minerals (private)
Neptune Minerals is a private company run by Odyssey’s former CEO John Morris.
Neptune is aggregating underwater mineral rights in the Southwest Pacific.  Odyssey owns 6.2 million shares, or 30% of Neptune, which at the last private round of $17.50 per share would imply a $109 million value. According to Odyssey’s June 30th 10Q, “Odyssey and Neptune are currently planning operations in one of Neptune’s highly prospective tenement areas to produce a formal resource estimate.”
  Chatham Rock Phosphate (Publicly traded in New Zealand)
Chatham Rock Phosphate has large phosphate deposits off the New Zealand coast and is seeking a mineral license.  Odyssey’s 9.32 million share stake is worth $3 million at recent prices, although a discount is probably warranted given the liquidity and trading restrictions.
  Oceanica Resources, S. de R.L. (private)
Oceanica is an Odyssey subsidiary based in Panama focused on mineral exploration.  According to Odyssey’s June 2013 10Q:
  [Oceanica] controls exclusive permits for offshore mineral deposits in an area, which is believed to feature a valuable mineral resource, based on extensive exploratory activities undertaken by Odyssey.
  Investors first learned about Oceanica in February 2013 when Odyssey announced the sale of 15 million shares in Oceanica (and an option to purchase another 15 million shares at $2.50) for $15 million to an investment fund called Mako Resources LLC.  Following the transaction Odyssey owned 62.6 million shares out of 100 million outstanding, implying a $62.6 million value.
  While Odyssey and Oceanica have not made public what type of resource Oceanica is targeting, it does appear Oceanica has made significant progress in defining its find.  While the March 30, 2013 10Q report stated:
  Preliminary resource assessments indicate that the concessions may prove to have significant economic value.
  The June 30th 10Q replaced that language with (emphasis ours):
  Preliminary resource assessment based on extensive coring and laboratory work suggests that the mining concession, which has been granted for a 50 year period to a subsidiary of Oceanica, is a world-class resource with significant commercial and strategic value. Coring sample assay results and preliminary sample beneficiation tests (sizing and flotation) indicate that the resource can be feasibly and economically mined and processed. A draft Technical Report featuring a formal resource assessment is in process and one of the world’s leading investment banks is advising the company on options for maximizing the value of this asset.
  In June 2013, Mako and Odyssey renegotiated a portion of the option contract whereby Mako purchased 8 million shares of Oceanica at $1.25 per share.  While this is below the original $2.50 per share option agreement it is still 25% higher than the $1 per share price from February and did not include any attached options.  The price apparently was adjusted “to facilitate the transaction.”  We read this as Odyssey needed the money for the Gairsoppa salvage operation.  At the same time, “to maintain control”, Odyssey purchased 1 million shares of Oceanica from another equity holder at $1.25 per share and was granted a one-year option to purchase another 1 million shares at $2.50. 
  Mako still holds options (expiring December 31, 2013) to purchase seven million Oceanica shares at $2.50 per share.  Odyssey currently owns 55.6 million shares of Oceanica, which if valued at the $1.25 last transaction price would imply a value of $69.5 million.   If the asset truly proves to be a “word class resource”, we believe this stake could be worth significantly more than $69.5 million.
  Capital Structure
  Odyssey’s clear weakness has been its capital structure.  Shipwreck recoveries and undersea mineral exploration both require significant risk capital, a resource Odyssey has had little of, forcing it into value leaking project financing transactions or dilutive convertible debt sales.  
  The Gairsoppa silver recovery and Oceanica share sales have put Odyssey in a position of strength for the first time in many years.  With approximately $25 million of cash pro forma for Gairsoppa silver sales, Odyssey should not be forced into hard money project financing or dilutive equity transactions.

  Summary
Odyssey Marine Exploration is a compelling opportunity today because the company is well positioned with a capital structure, business plan, and project opportunities that are not understood by the market.  A history of controversy, bad luck and the nature of Odyssey’s business has resulted in the stock being largely ignored by the analyst and institutional investor community.  A significant change in Odyssey’s prospects goes unappreciated, and at current prices one is practically getting future opportunities for free.  Multiple catalysts are near term (next 6 to 18 months) and the downside is limited due to what appears to be meaningful asset values relative to the market capitalization and the more predictable nature of the commodity wreck recovery business as a base line.

Warning: ILLIQUID AND HARD TO BORROW.
But if you can play...NUZE has a $500mm market cap, stock is up from its $9 offering in June to a current price of $35, and last FY did revenue of $2 milllion and had ebit of -$5 million.  Stock trades at 275x revenue which is expensive even for a Saas company but NUZE is a contract manufacturer of single serve pour over coffee (which has not really caught on in the USA and is very different than k cups, pods, etc)...not exactly a booming biz.  The company had a going concern until it hired Benchmark to raise $7mm at $9.00 per share in late June.  Besides the valuation, some of the numerous red flags include: bad business model, 2 customers represent over 50% of revenue, material weaknesses, burning cash, Nevada corp, unclear if/when will ever be profitable, CFO was an oil and gas banker...need i go on???
There has been no real news which might justify the huge stock price increase...although insiders control 50% which can contribute to a squeeze.
Again, NUZE is just a contract manufacturer.  It utilizes high end machines to make its products and it believes that its exclusive access to these machines gives it a competitive advantage....well, it used to give them a competitive advantage because the exclusivity was terminated on June 30!  Interestingly, the termination occurred one week after the equity offering closed!  
NUZE says ""We own sophisticated packing equipment developed by East Asian companies for pour over coffee production. We believe these manufacturers are the world leaders for supplying such machines. While lower-grade equipment alternatives do exist, availability is extremely limited for the top-grade equipment that generates co-packing products to the exacting specifications we believe large, established companies will demand. For example, we estimate, based solely on our experience, the current wait time for the production and delivery of co-packing machinery of the type we use in our Vista, California plant is approximately two years. We obtained these machines under a written exclusivity agreement with the premier supplier of the type of high-quality packing equipment we use for our products, FUSO Industries Co. Ltd. (“FUSO”), which contractually remains in effect in the North American market until June 30, 2020, and which we believe significantly restricts our North American competitors’ access to this equipment. However, FUSO has exercised its rights to terminate the exclusivity agreement on six months’ prior written notice.
The FUSO agreement expired on June 30, 2020.  Does NUZE lose a competitive advantage? Does new competition enter the field? Why did Fuso terminate the agreement?  All interesting questions but at 275x revenue, do the answers really matter?  
  What is Pour Over Coffee?
Pour-over coffee is the simplest method of coffee brewing. No expensive machines needed, simply pour hot water over the grounds. The pour over method of making coffee extracts robust flavored coffee and delicious aroma into your cup.

Thesis:
  BioCryst (BCRX) is a small cap biotech with a drug (BCX7553) for hereditary angioedema (HAE) that is commercially non-viable. While there is a small chance that BCX7553 is approved by the FDA later this year for acute attacks of the disease, it will never gain more a minuscule share of the market. Bulls are overestimating the odds of FDA approval for acute attacks and the longer-term potential of the drug in the prophylactic indication. Once people fully realize that BCRX is iron pyrite and not gold, and that the best-case scenario is an expensive drug launch against vastly larger competitors with superior products, BCRX will be a penny stock, leading to 75%+ downside.
  A very brief overview of hereditary angioedema and the current market:
  HAE is a terrible disease that thankfully affects very few people (perhaps 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 50,000). It is a severe swelling disease that is chronic. This swelling is caused by a genetic defect that can result in blood vessels releasing fluid into the body. In extreme cases, the swelling can get so severe that the airway passages are blocked and cause suffocation.
  Since the underlying disease can be so severe and the condition is chronic, it’s a lucrative indication for pharma companies that target rare diseases with so-called orphan drugs. As is typical for orphan drugs, that market come with high margins and limited pricing pressure compared to other indications. In 2017, J.P Morgan estimated there are c. 10,000 HAE patients in the United States, which should support ~$2bn of high-margin sales in 2020.
  Due to these factors, the HAE space is a highly competitive one and there are currently two main players (Takada and CSL) who serve the market. There are seven FDA approved products for HAE: https://www.haea.org/pages/p/ApprovedTreatments with Takada owning  Takhzyro, Cinryze, Firazyr, and Kalbitor, while CSL competes with Berinert. There is also generic competition entering as Firazyr goes off-patent in the second half of this year.
  Some of them are for acute attacks, while others are used prophylactically to prevent swelling episodes from occurring. Currently, all approved HAE drugs are administered via injection or by IV, although two other companies aside from BCRX are working on oral treatments: Kalvista (KALV) and Attune Pharmaceuticals (private).
  How does BioCryst stack up?
  So, how is BCRX’s offering going to do in this lucrative but competitive space? It’s the first oral treatment to read out, which could make it more convenient.
  All the current HAE drugs are quite effective, but Takhzyro is the best comparator for BCRX. Takhzyro is a preventative HAE therapy that is administered via injection, and when taken every two-weeks, lowers the rate of HAE attacks by 87%. When taken monthly, the HAE attack rate was lowered by 73%.
  In comparison, BCRX ran a large and well-powered pivotal trial that achieved statistical success: http://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/45948ef9-0869-4d0a-a485-71afc2c783f7
  However, statistical success and commercial relevancy are not the same thing. The two different dosings of BCX7553 in the trial reduced attacks by 30% and 44% respectively, a far cry from the efficacy of Takhzyro.  
    Furthermore, none of the Secondary Outcomes (largely relating to quality of life) were statistically significant (this was only mentioned on the conference call discussing the results). Worse yet, there was the possibility of minor safety issues, as one patient had to discontinue taking BCX7553 due to an abnormal liver function test:
  Bulls will agree that these numbers don’t match up well compared to Takhzyro. This is the reason BCRX stock is down ~50% since they released the trial results. However, bulls argue that the oral convenience of BCX7353 will overcome the lesser efficacy. I think the FDA will have a great deal of concern over approving a drug like that for a chronic and life-threatening disease. However, let’s assume that the bulls are correct, and that the FDA looks past the sub-par efficacy, the lack of improvement of quality of life, and the potential liver issues, and instead decides to approve BCX7353 because a twice-a-day oral pill is more convenient than a once-a month injection.
  In that best-case scenario, BCRX is faced with launching a sub-par product against two entrenched industry players, who will both be very motivated to keep the valuable and scarce HAE patients on their current drugs. In addition, BCRX will be faced with financing a second Phase III pivotal trial for BCX7553, this time in the prophylactic indication and which could read out in the second half of 2020. There is no reason to think that this trial will be any more of a success, as it is the same drug in the same population. All of this is going to be very expensive, so let’s now look at the BCRX balance sheet:
    At first glance, this doesn’t seem too bad, and BCRX likes to boast that they have a runway into 2020. But what then? Cash utilization will only go up if BCRX is running another Phase III trial and preparing to launch BCX7353 commercially. Furthermore, the Senior Credit Facility is no panacea, as it bears interest at LIBOR +8%, and comes with significant restrictions:
  Note 5 — Senior Credit Facility
  On February 5, 2019, the Company entered into a $100,000 Senior Credit Facility with an affiliate of MidCap Financial Services, LLC, as administrative agent (the “Second Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility”). Borrowings under the Second Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility will be available in three tranches, with (i) the first tranche comprised of $50,000 funded at closing, which includes $30,000 of proceeds that were deemed rolled over from the outstanding principal amount under the Company’s prior credit agreement, (ii) the second tranche to be comprised of $30,000, and (iii) the third tranche to be comprised of $20,000, with the second and third tranches to be funded upon the completion of certain contingencies related to the Company’s development activities of its product candidates and the establishment of certain financial covenants. The Second Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility refinanced and replaced the Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility dated as of July 20, 2018 (the “Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility”). The Second Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility bears a variable interest rate of LIBOR (which shall not be less than 0.5%) plus 8%. The Second Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility includes an interest-only payment period through June 2020 and scheduled monthly principal and interest payments for the subsequent 30 months. The Company used a portion of the proceeds of the Second Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility to pay off outstanding amounts under the Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility and the remainder will be used for general corporate purposes. Under the Second Amended and Restated Senior Credit Facility, the Company must maintain a minimum cash balance of $25,000 of unrestricted cash at all times. Should the Company access the additional second tranche of $30,000 upon satisfying the positive APeX-2 positive data and NDA filing milestone criteria, the unrestricted cash balance minimum increases to $40,000.
  https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/882796/000117184319003220/f10q_050919p.htm
  Given these restrictions, I expect BCRX to issue dilutive capital sooner than later. They have an S-3 shelf Effective from 12/12/17 with $150mn remaining on it.
  Finally, although BCRX calls their pipeline robust, it is anything but:
    BCRC7353 is, at this point, more of a liability than anything else, and the other pipeline products are all preclinical and will require additional funding. The Supporting Asset Rapivab is an intravenous flu drug, has been licensed out, and brings in minimal revenue. There’s nothing more to this company.
  Executive Summary:
  BCRX is extremely overvalued due to bulls overestimating the appeal of an inferior but oral HAE drug.
The odds of an FDA approval are very doubtful.
In the best-case scenario, BCRX 7353 is approved and launched into a marketplace dominated by two larger competitors with superior products.
The dynamics of the HAE market are such that each patient is lucrative. The entrenched players will not sit by and allow BCRX to gain any real market share.
BCRX does not have the balance sheet to sustain a drug launch and will have to resort to severely dilutive financing, turning the company into a penny stock.
                                I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise do not hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

Value Line is cheap. I give it a 3 for timeliness, a 1 for safety and a 1 for cheapness (and as a value investor, cheap with a great business is a potent combination). The story is very simple. The stock is at $35.94, with about 10mn shares outstanding. The company has approximately $25 per share in net cash (after netting out deferred revenue). So, for $11, you get well over $2 per share in earnings for the businesses (exclusive of income from investments, which are largely investments in Value Line’s own mutual funds). The businesses are the mutual fund business and the well known investment survey (print and computer) and profits are earned roughly 60/40 in favor of investment management.

Assets under management alone equal approximately $6 billion. At the low end of the going rate for these type of mutual fund assets --3%, the mutual fund operations are worth at least $18 per share. The valuation level of recent transactions has been well above 3% of assets and includes deals such as UniCredito's October 2000 acquisition of Pioneer Group for 5% of assets under management and the acquisition of Sanford Bernstein in June 2000 by Alliance Capital for approximately 4% of assets. Mutual fund assets tend to be valued higher than Bernstein's institutional money management business.

The Publications area has shown no growth in the last 5 yrs, but is still highly profitable, generating about $1.70 in EBIT per share for the latest fiscal year. Earnings have been trending down in this segment, as it has had competition from the internet, but I am still willing to throw in a minimum of $10 per share for the publication (way low) and we get a low case value of $53 per share (I think the real number is well north of $60 per share). Not too bad.

Company History:
III was founded in July 2006 as a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) and raised approximately $255M through an IPO in February of 2007. In November 2007, the Company acquired privately held TPI for $230MM in cash and 5 million warrants, which have no value.
TPI Overview:
TPI is the pioneer in sourcing advisory services and is the market share leader. TPI has advised on over 25% of sourcing market since 2000 and over 45% of Global 500 companies. With ~450 employees globally ($300K+/employee) and operations in 15 countries, TPI is the world’s leading sourcing data and advisory firm.
Customers:
TPI has a diversified blue chip client base serving customers such as Volvo, MetLife, Zurich, AT&T, P&G, Kroger, Home Depot, Marathon Oil, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Air Canada, Singapore Airlines, as well as state and federal governmental agencies.
Services:
1) Inform - Market-leading research and analysis along with practical experience and a market perspective, allows to help make informed decisions.  Includes Research & Insights and Events.
2) Assess – Provides strong rationale and informed change strategy to clients.  Evaluates all risks and opportunities and includes Benchmarking and Maturity Assessments.

Pricing for services varies client to client, but on average the assessment portion costs $250K +, the strategy development, negotiation and implementation / execution piece normally costs $1M+ and the service governance / monitoring piece generally costs $500K+. The service governance / monitoring piece of the business has significant value as it has grown from startup to $8M YTD 2012 revenues since 2008.
In addition to these services, III provides proprietary databases of sourcing-related market intelligence that are the product of extensive market research and client engagements derived from assignments that the Company has conducted over the last 20+ years.
Competition:
The competitive landscape is fragmented by industry as well as by geography. The purest competitors are two other independent sourcing advisors, Everest (privately held) and EquaTerra, recently acquired by KPMG in February 2011 (terms undisclosed.) On the research side, III competes with Forrester and Gartner as well as the strategy consultants such as Booz Allen, AT Kearney, Bain & McKinsey. III also competes with the service providers such as Infosys, Capgemini, Wipro, IBM, ACS, EDS, Accenture, Deloitte, & PWC.
Acquisitions:
III executed two strategic tack-on acquisitions which fit nicely into their operations. The first acquisition (January 2011) was Compass, a premier independent global provider of business and IT benchmarking, performance improvement, and data and analytics whose clients include large MNCs in Europe, Asia and the U.S. III acquired this business for 0.5x revenue and 5.5x adjusted EBITDA at a price of $19.5MM. The second acquisition (February 2011) was STA Consulting, which advises clients on IT strategic planning and the acquisition and implementation of new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and other enterprise administrative and management systems. STA provides increase penetration into the public sector industry vertical and was acquired for 0.6x revenue and 4.5x adj. EBITDA at a price of $9.0MM in cash with an additional $8.0MM earnout over the next five years.
The acquisitions provide strategic value for III, as Compass provides entry into 6 new geographies – Brazil, Finland, Italy, Korea, South Africa, and Spain. In addition, Compass provides further penetration into blue chip clientele and the combined companies serve 75 of the Forbes Global 100. STA provides further penetration into the public sector vertical, where III has witnessed early success and sees future growth. Combined, III now will have ~700 employees and operate in 21 countries and truly be the largest global independent sourcing data and advisory firm.
The 40% increase in 2011 revenues is attributable principally to an increase in European and Asia Pacific revenues, primarily due to the acquisitions of Compass and STA Consulting.
Price Target:
Implementing a 2012E Forward EBITDA multiple of 8.0x, fair value for III is approximately $3.00/ share, or +~140% from the current share price. The 8.0x multiple is a conservative multiple considering the most relative public comparables in the space (Forrester Research & Gartner) trade at an average 2012E multiple of 10.0x and the Informational / Professional Services universe trades around 10.0x.  
For 2012E, we have assumed 7% revenue growth and 12.5% EBITDA growth from 2011 (both the midpoint of Management’s guidance - full year guidance of constant currency growth of revenues between 6-8% and Adjusted EBITDA growth between 10%-15% for 2012) and have assigned a more reasonable 8.0x multiple to derive our $3.00/share price target.
Variant View:
Risks:
1) Competition is increasing as traditional management consultants and outsourcing providers offer analytics
2) As clients become more experienced, they may use less advisory services

  We believe Nucor (NUE) is a compellingshort over a1-year horizon. Nucor is the largest US steel producer.
It is a well-run company with high-quality assets. However, its stock has overshot (+100% YTD) on what
should be only a temporary supply/demand in balance in the steel market. What’s most perplexing is that
NUE has traditionally been the “low beta” defensive steel play, but this time the stock is outperforming
other steel companies with much higher leverage (X, CLF, etc). We believe this is largely due to technical
factors that will also relent. Oh, and did we mention the company decided to go “pedal to the metal” on
stock buybacks after the stock doubled YTD and with earnings at a cyclical high. This is a textbook case of
“peak multiple on peak earnings” that you can play to the $75/share level for a 30% gain.
    Nucor was one of the early pioneers producing steel in electric arc furnaces (EAF, or minimills), versus the
traditional method of blast oxygen furnaces (BOF, or integrated mills). EAFs are highly efficient and flexible
assets where production can be dialed up or down depending on the market environment. This posed a
big advantage versus BOFs, which have a high fixed cost structure and which are very expensive to stop
and restart production. EAFs have been consistently gaining share in the developed world and are now
the market leaders anywhere there’s plentiful scrap available to feed them. This whole dynamic was well-
chronicled in Clay Christensen’s renowned “The Innovator’s Dilemma.”
    NUE comprises 3 segments:
• Steel mills: NUE operates 25 steel mills in the US, with combined capacity of 27mm tons/year.
This segment typically accounts for 80%+ of total EBITDA.
• Steel products: its downstream segment, including finishing and fabrication into more value-
added steel products. Generally accounts for 15% of NUE’s EBITDA.
• Raw materials: essentially a scrap recycling operation. A lower-margin business that is generally a
5-10% contributor to total earnings.
  The recent surge in profitability has been driven by the Mills segment, as the spread between steel prices
and scrap metal has skyrocketed. The spread between Hot Rolled Coil (HRC) steel and busheling scrap has
ballooned to near $1,000/ton, vs a mid-cycle avg closer to $300/ton and a prior cycle peak in 2018 that
didn’t even reach $600/ton. This surge in spreads has been driven by an extremely tight steel market. This
has been a function of a) Demand, as production of autos and manufacturing has rebounded much quicker
than expected and b) Supply, which has been constrained as integrated players such as CLF and X shut
down blast furnace capacity last year that they have so far not brought back.
    Steel has always been a cyclical industry. There’s no “new paradigm” here, as new supply is already coming
in and demand should also cool off. We believe supply will be the bigger driver in the near-term and will
drive margins back to the historical average. STLD has a new 3mm ton capacity mill in Sinton, TX opening
in the next few months. NUE itself has 1.2mm ton coming online in 2022. CLF and X are so far holding the
line, but the longer prices remain elevated, the higher the opportunity costs. Finally, a surge in imports is
always a threat, particularly as the spread between US and Europe/China prices is also at its all-time highs.
  Our normalized EBITDA number is $3bn, down from 2021’s expected $6.8bn but still above 2017 and 2019
levels. At a 7x multiple (over the past decade, NUE has traded quite consistently within the 6-8x range),
it’d result in a $21bn EV valuation. But until margins normalize, NUE and its peers will be minting cash. If
we account for 2021-22 FCF generation of $4-4.5bn, that would result in a target EV of $25-26bn, which 
net of $2,891mm in net debt results in $22-23bn target market cap, or $75/share. Note that consensus
also has 2023 EBITDA at $3bn. We believe the stock will begin to fade as the supply/demand picture starts
to ease and it becomes apparent there is little to no upside to that $3bn estimate.
  We lack the ability to pinpoint when steel prices peak or how quickly they will correct. But we’ve seen this
movie before in commodity industries: the moment supply additions are announced and/or
supply/demand tightness shows early signs of relenting, multiples compress materially even before the
commodity prices have peaked. This is currently happening in sector like polyethylene or beverage cans,
and steel will be no different.
  Finally, NUE is guilty of that classic sin of cyclical industries: ratcheting up buybacks at the cyclical peak,
with the stock up 100% YTD and at its all-time high. NUE announced in April it was raising its target
leverage to 18-22% net debt/capital from its then 13%, hinting buybacks would be the way to get there.
We believe this buying pressure has been largely to blame for NUE’s outperformance vs higher-beta steel
names like CLF, X or its closest peer STLD. We feel buyback activity is likely to slow materially imminently,
as NUE announced a $1bn purchase last week of a metals panel business from CNR that will comfortably
put it within its new targeted leverage ratio.

I and/or others I advise do not hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

La Quinta’s (LQ) upcoming spin of their owned hotels (in combination with the sale of their franchised business) into a REIT presents investors with all the hallmarks of a classic undervalued / underestimated spin: the spun off business will be completely different than the current one, management is going to the spinco, the trailing financials are messy, a quirk in the deal structure incentivizes management to sandbag numbers / valuation heading into the spin, and the spinco will be a juicy acquisition target for a variety of strategic acquirers. Using relatively conservative assumptions, I believe the entire company is worth more than $23/share today, which presents solid upside from today’s price of $18.60/share. However, I also think that upside undersells the opportunity, as $8.40/share will be returned in cash in the near term (sometime in Q2). Looking through that cash distribution, you’re creating the REIT business (CorePoint) for ~$10 against my valuation of >$15, presenting over 50% upside. 
Some background: La Quinta is (as you might expect) the owner / operator / franchisor of the La Quinta hotel brand. In addition to operating the La Quinta brand / franchise, the company owns a bunch of the La Quinta hotels (i.e. they own the physical building). In early 2017 the company announced a plan to pursue a taxable spin that would split off the owned real estate into a REIT and leave behind the high margin franchise / brand management business. In early 2018, the plan changed slightly: the company announced they were selling the La Quinta franchise / management business to Wyndham, and concurrent with the sale they would spin off the REIT as a company known as CorePoint Lodging. The whole transaction should close in Q2’18.
The terms of the Wyndham agreement call for Wyndham to pay LQ shareholders $8.40/share in cash in addition to paying off some debt and covering taxes associated with spinning CorePoint off in a taxable spin. So, at today’s price of $18.60, LQ shareholders are paying for the right to receive ~$8.40 when the Wyndham transaction closes in the next few months plus the remaining CorePoint business. So let’s turn to CorePoint: what exactly is it and what’s it worth?
You can find a ton of info on CorePoint in the Form 10 La Quinta filed for in in September as well as in their July spin-off investor presentation, but basically CorePoint is a REIT that owns 319 La Quinta hotels. The charts below (slides 18+19 in their spin-off presentation) should give you a bit more feel for the type of properties CorePoint owns; I’ve also included a slide from the Wyndham / La Quinta deck to help you think about where La Quinta falls within the Wyndham portfolio.
Hopefully the above has given you a good idea on what the CorePoint hotels look like; I’m not going to spend a ton of time given more of an overview since the Form 10 covers the business in great detail and I would guess most investors / human beings are somewhat familiar with the hotel industry. So let’s start talking about how to value CorePoint. There are plenty of publicly traded Hotel REITs so we can triangulate a decent peer multiple. If you look at p. 161 of their spinoff docs you can find the nine REITs they consider peers (DRH, STAY, HT, HPT, HST, LHO, RLJ, RHP, INN). Of those nine, I think RLJ, INN, and HT are probably the best peers (all three are, like CorePoint, internally managed, have a third party operate their hotel, and while they target higher end segments than CorePoint they’re not that much higher end; CLDT probably belongs in this discussion too but wasn’t in the proxy), and I’d consider HPT, STAY, and RHP the worst peers for a variety of reasons (STAY’s paired share structure means they own the Extended Stay brand and makes them more similar to LQ pre-spin/sale, HPT is externally managed and ~a third of their earnings come from Travel Centers (a completely different business which is undergoing some distress), and RHP’s convention type hotels are a whole different segment). Anyway, it’s probably not worth splitting too many hairs worrying about which peer is best or worst as they all trade in a relatively tight range. The average / median company in that group of nine trades for 11-12x forward EV / EBITDA, similar to where my three favorite peers trade. The slide below (which I stole from RLJ’s November Investor Deck; you can easily update it yourself but valuations have not budged much so it’s useful for illustration) does a nice job of laying out all of the different valuation metrics for a loose group of peers (and probably suggests my 11x is a bit on the conservative side).
Ok, so we can reasonably / conservatively assume CorePoint is going to be worth ~11x EBITDA, so let’s start to figure out what it’s worth. At a basic level, we know what CorePoint’s earnings and capital structure look like. In the July presentation, they guided to $200-215m in EBITDA for CorePoint, and their Q4’17 call confirmed they hit the middle of that range. We also know that CorePoint has taken out a $1,035 CMBS mortgage that will fund post spin, and we know LQ has ~118m shares outstanding. So, at its most simple, CorePoint’s value would look something like the below. 
Add that to the $8.40 payment from Wyndham and you get a combined company value of ~$19, which gives a little upside from today’s prices, but it would basically be a rounding error of upside.
Here’s where things start to get interesting. I think it could be argued that almost every assumption (excluding the shares outstanding) I made in building that valuation is much too conservative. Hopefully this doesn’t get too far into “conspiracy theory” territory, but after I walk through how conservative each assumption is (and how little information management is giving), I think you’ll see why I think management is sandbagging a lot of these numbers.
Let’s start with the simplest number: the multiple I used. I used 11x trailing earnings to value CorePoint, which is around the low end of where peers are trading on forward earnings. I’m not going to split hairs here, but increasing the multiple to 12x, probably a bit more in line with their peers, would add ~$2/share to CorePoint’s value.
Ok, multiple out the way, let’s turn to the CMBS debt. You’ll notice that I used the gross CMBS net debt number, which I think will end up being much too punitive. The reasoning lies in the details of the merger agreement. While the press release highlights that Wyndham will “repay $715m of La Quinta debt net of cash” as part of the acquisition, the deal is actually structured so that CorePoint will take out the $1,035m CMBS loan to pay a $983.95m dividend to LQ Parent as part of the spin off. This dividend is subject to adjustment up or down to the extent “estimated existing net indebtedness” is different than the target net debt of $1.665B (see page E-4 and E-23); the difference between those two numbers (plus $30m in transaction expenses Wyndham will cover, which is also subject to adjustment up or down) is how they arrive at that $715m debt paydown number. La Quinta had net debt of ~$1.55B at 12/31/17, so they’re already >$100m below the net debt target before any cash build between 12/31/17 and the spin. Given CorePoint’s raising $1,035m in debt to pay a ~$984m dividend (so ~$50m excess there) and they are already >$100m below their net debt target, I’m going to say CorePoint will spin with at least $120m in excess cash on their balance sheet, good for ~$1/share in value.
Let’s move on to the EBITDA number. I think it’s wildly conservative to use the ~$207m in trailing EBITDA for a few reasons. 
Hurricane impact: Hurricane Irma affected a significant piece of CorePoint’s business; per the Q4 call, over 8% of owned rooms were out of service at peak interruption time. Management estimated the Q4 impact was ~$6m, and they estimate the 2018 impact will be $28-35m. As we move into 2019, that hurricane impact should fully annualize, which will drive serious earnings growth.
Capital Investment program: CorePoint / La Quinta started a $180m renovation project in Q4’16 and finished the project in January 2018. Their Q3 call provide some details on the early returns of these projects, which include NPS scores at the hotels they renovate up 50% and RevPAR up 11% (driven by a 10%+ increase in ADR). Given the project just completed, it’s actually having a negative impact on trailing earnings (renovations leave some rooms out of order) but should have a serious positive impact on go forward earnings. If you assume any reasonable ROIC for the project, it should have a serious impact on earnings going forward. I assume the $180m investment results in ~$15m annualized increase in EBITDA (~8.5% ROIC), which is probably too low based on both what I’ve seen in peers (INN, for example, projected ROIC from renovations in the teens, and RLJ is guiding to low double digit ROI for their capex projects) and how CorePoint management is talking about the project but feels within the realm of reasonableness.
Synergies from La Quinta combining with Wyndham: CorePoint should realize some return from La Quinta being brought into the Wyndham family. Wyndham’s size should yield significant advantages for all La Quinta franchisees (better OTA pricing, better rates for advertising given the company’s size, combining La Quinta’s loyalty program into Wyndham’s to get a new base of users (probably in 2019), maybe offering CorePoint hotels the ability to switch to other Wyndham brands in locations where it makes sense), which should result in some improvement in CorePoint’s hotel performance. Wyndham certainly thinks there’s synergies from buying La Quinta; they’re forecasting $50m+ in synergies against <$100m of Wyndham’s definition of Adj. EBITDA for La Quinta. Obviously we’re talking apples to oranges comparing franchisor earnings / synergies to hotel earnings, but it’s tough to imagine that Wyndham could improve the whole system by that much and it wouldn’t have some positive impact on the franchisees (FWIW, Wyndham is also forecasting accelerating La Quinta’s long term growth as they fully integrate the system). I realize this is the squishiest part of the thesis and it’s hard to fully quantify the potential here, but I’ll back my thoughts up on this with three facts. 
La Quinta’s proxy makes explicitly clear that one factor the board considered in selling La Quinta was how much value the buyer could bring as an operator for the CorePoint business.
La Qunita’s owned hotels (which will become CorePoint) have substantially underperformed LQ’s franchised hotels over the past two years, and the LQ brand in general still has a rate gap versus some of its peers. Obviously a lot of factors go into that, but this suggests that a more focused / experienced hotel operator would have a real shot at improving ADR / margins for both CorePoint hotels specifically and the La Quinta brand more broadly.
CorePoint’s hotel EBITDA margins (Adjusted EBITDA with SG&A added back) are currently ~30%. The slide below is from a CLDT investor deck and shows that CorePoint’s ~30% hotel EBITDA margin would be at the very low end of Full-Service hotels. CorePoint’s hotels are Select-Service, which are generally much higher margin, so I don’t think it’s crazy to think there’s significant room for upside here. 
The pushback here would be CorePoint’s ADR / target market is way below all these peers (I’ll discuss this more in the risk section), but I don’t think that’s a completely fair pushback. For example, INN’s ADR is <$150 versus RLJ at $165 and HT at ~$220 yet INN’s EBITDA margins are significantly higher.
Bottom line: I assume Wyndham buying La Quinta eventually adds another $10m in EBITDA for CorePoint (just over 1% of LTM revenues). 
There are likely other areas of earnings upside you could point to if you wanted to get a bit more aggressive. For example, CorePoint’s biggest market is Texas, and the Texas hotels were hit hard by the oil downturn in 2015/2016 and have really just started to stabilize. I’d guess as we continue to move away from the oil bust those hotels see performance improvements. I’ve also been comping CorePoint to peers using forward multiples / earnings while using LTM earnings for CorePoint, so you could probably build a bit of growth into CorePoint as well. 
Still, those “other upside” areas are likely smaller impacts long term. I’m just going to stick to the three things mentioned above (Wyndham synergies, Hurricane impact rolling off, and returns from their capital investment program); combined, they add another ~$31m to EBITDA, taking CorePoint’s “run rate EBITDA” to ~$239m. Note that this is by no means a heroic EBITDA number; even if we assumed all of the “addbacks” to get to run rate EBITDA flowed straight through to the bottom line (i.e. resulted in no change to LTM revenue), these EBITDA numbers would result in ~34% hotel EBITDA margins / ~29% adjusted EBITDA margins, still towards the low end of peers. Given most of these changes will almost certainly drive revenue growth (i.e. reopening the hotels shutdown by the hurricane drives EBITDA growth through selling more rooms), I think it’s clear these are not aggressive EBITDA estimates just based on the EBITDA margin potential versus peers. I’d also note that as recently as 2014 LQ’s owned hotels (which will become CorePoint) were doing >35% hotel EBITDA margins. There’s been a bit of asset repositioning (i.e. hotel sales) since then, but again I think this emphasizes that I’m not forecasting anything out of this world from these hotels.
There are a bunch of other things that I think could break correctly for CorePoint and reduce their multiple even further (for example, insurance recovery from the hurricanes could add another $20-40m in cash), but I think we’ve hit most of the obvious ones. So let’s put it all together: if we slap an 11x multiple on $239m of EBITDA and take out $1,035m of CMBS debt but addback $120m of excess cash, we come out with an equity value of just under $1.7B and a per share value for CorePoint of ~$14.48/share. Add that to the $8.40/share in cash from the Wyndham deal and shares should be trading of ~$22.90, presenting ~23% upside to today’s share price of ~$18.60 (or ~42% if I look through the $8.40/share cash payment).
Hopefully at this point I’ve showed a bunch of ways that CorePoint is undervalued. The question then becomes why management is lowballing numbers / not highlighting just how wrong today’s share price is. After all, most managers know that spinoffs have trouble finding an investor base and are constantly out pitching what a great deal the stock is leading up to a spin, particularly in a spin that’s part of a deal shareholders have to vote on / approve. I think the answer to that question lies in a hidden tax provision in their Wyndham deal.
The press release on the La Quinta sale contains a near throwaway line that Wyndham will “set aside a reserve of $240 million for estimated taxes expected to be incurred in connection with the taxable spin-off of La Quinta’s owned real estate assets into CorePoint Lodging Inc.” However, if you dig through the proxy and the merger agreement, you can see that the tax reserve amount was not a throwaway amount; in fact, it was the subject of a good deal of negotiation. But what’s really interesting is that the tax reserve is just an estimate of how much tax the spin will incur, and, to the extent the tax incurred is less than $240m, CorePoint gets to keep the difference (if it’s more than $240m, CorePoint has to pay La Quinta the difference, but as I’ll show in a second that’d be a happy problem for investors at today’s prices to have). 
So how is the tax owed determined? For a taxable spin, the value of the asset is not determined until the asset is spun; at that time, the share price for the first day of trading is used to determine the asset’s value. So, if you spin off an asset with a book value of $10 and it trades for $100, you would owe taxes on $90 worth of gains. If you spun off the same asset and it traded for $15, you would owe taxes on just $5 of gains. 
You can probably see where I’m going with this: the CorePoint / Wyndham agreement calls for a fixed tax payment. If the taxes are lower than that payment, CorePoint keeps the proceeds. If the taxes are higher, CorePoint covers the excess. Because the tax payment is based on CorePoint’s share price at the time of spin, CorePoint is actually incentivized to try to keep their share price as low as possible heading into the spin, as doing so results in more cash coming on to their balance sheet / less going to Uncle Sam (Wyndham doesn’t really care what happens; they’re on the hook for $240m no matter what). (Note that this is not a completely unique situation: Disney / Fox have a somewhat similar issue with their taxable spin of the remaining Fox assets, though they use an increase in Disney shares to FOX holders to resolve the “lower than expected” tax “problem”). 
In addition to the Wyndham tax incentive above, I’d note that this is a taxable spin, which means that shareholders are taxed as having a taxable event the day the spin happens. I think that tax hit also increases the incentive for management to keep the share price as low as possible heading in to the spin, as a lower share price = a lower near term tax bill for management (moderate insider ownership; could be higher but definitely enough to justify working towards a lower share price / tax payment) and Blackstone (who own 30% of the company with what I believe is a very low basis). 
With that understanding of the tax issues and how they incentivize management to depress the share price, I think the whole CorePoint puzzle makes a lot of sense. Why aren’t they providing 2018 guidance? Why aren’t they providing more info on their post-spin balance sheet? Why haven’t they put out an investor deck highlighting the CorePoint business since July 2017 (and that one was extremely skimpy!)? Why aren’t they giving more info on the return from their capital investment projects? It’s because to do so would make this easier to value / show how cheap it is and result in a transfer of value from CorePoint to Uncle Sam. At current prices, I estimate that the company will owe only ~$150m in taxes; the difference between that payment and the $240m Wyndham will cover (so $90m net) will flow straight through to new CorePoint’s balance sheet, representing ~$0.80/share in extra cash and bringing my “post tax / excess cash” fair value for CorePoint to just shy of $15.30/share.
Before we move away from taxes, I want to point out one more data point we can get from the Wyndham tax payment. We know that Wyndham has agreed to pay $240m in tax payments, and we also know that the CorePoint assets have a tax basis of ~$1.7B (management gave that number on their split call). If we assume CorePoint will have a ~25% tax rate, that would imply Wyndham and CorePoint agreed on a ~$2.66B valuation ($240m / 25% + $1.7B) for the CorePoint assets (note if you used the current corporate rate of 21%, you’d get a bit over $2.8B). That’s slightly above the $2.62B valuation I used to come up with my ~$14.50/share CorePoint fair value estimate, which lends some credence to my valuation. Obviously there’s a bunch of assumptions on all sides here, but I think it’s just another sign pointing out that fair value for CorePoint is much higher than today’s prices.
At this point, I think I’ve walked through a credible case for CorePoint being undervalued and why management might be trying to undervalue the company. Let’s talk about how this plays out. The shareholder vote will happen at the end of April, and I’d expect the companies to close the transaction soon after the vote (they’ve already got HSR). Once the deal closes (and the low EV for tax purposes is locked in place), I’d expect management to be more open about potential levers for EBITDA growth, what the PF balance sheet will look like, etc. Management also has a history of being shareholder friendly (on top of this spin / sale, they have been aggressive share repurchasers in the past), so I wouldn’t be surprised to see some excess cash returned to shareholders if valuation’s remain low. 
The real prize, however, is potential M&A. Being a REIT 100% focused on La Quinta is probably unacceptable to investors long term, so I would guess there’s some M&A in the cards in the near term. My preference would clearly be for CorePoint to be a seller, and I’d note that this transaction being structured as a taxable spin would allow for the company to immediately be sold. The Hotel REIT M&A market is pretty strong (just last year we saw a bidding war between Ashford and RLJ for FelCor), and the synergies from throwing CorePoint on to another player’s platform would be pretty sizable (both RLJ and Ashford saw ~$20m in G&A synergies from buying FelCor. FelCor was roughly the same size as CorePoint; assuming a similar synergy level and an 11x multiple would suggest just shy of $2/share in synergy value from buying CorePoint). Obviously the valuation is dependent on the ultimate EBITDA levels and what the balance sheet ends up looking like, but if a larger player is willing to underwrite $250m in EBITDA plus another $20m in synergies, a sale price could easily approach $20/share and still prove accretive to a buyer.
The other end of the spectrum would have CorePoint deciding to be a buyer to diversify away from La Quinta. Obviously I’d prefer they sell at a premium than embark on a risky M&A program, but an acquisition program is certainly a possibility (p.5 of the spinoff docs highlight that their target segments are “highly fragmented and could benefit from consolidation” and that CorePoint’s scale gives them “a significant opportunity to be an active consolidator of hotel assets”). Still, I think the odds of them being a seller are much higher than being a buyer. Management has been very shareholder friendly, and Blackstone will remain a 30% shareholder of CorePoint after the deal goes through so I’d expect they’d prefer a sale to give them liquidity to exit. If they do decide to be a buyer, it’s not the end of the world. Their SG&A could clearly handle a much bigger platform, so they’d gain some benefit from scale, and having a shareholder friendly team pursuing a roll up strategy (with a large, financially savvy shareholder watching over them) isn’t the worst thing in the world. 
Other odds and ends + Risks
Share reverse split: Note that CorePoint will do a 1 for 2 reverse split when the deal / spin closes, so if you’re reading this a few months from now and thinking “wow, this was a home run,” I hope you’re right but you’ll need to adjust for that split.
Balance sheet: Obviously dependent on what EBITDA and net debt number you use, but CorePoint is going to be spinning with ~4x leverage (and likely dropping quickly given some of their earnings tailwinds). ~4x leverage is around their peer average, though given how easy it is to borrow secured against hotels some peers are a good deal more aggressive (HT, for example, is at 6.5x debt/EBITDA and 8.7x (debt+prefs) / EBITDA). CorePoint’s relatively conservative leverage should give management a lot of flexibility for capital allocation (dividends, repurchases, acquisitions, etc.).
Corporate overhead / margins: Sorry to keep coming back to the low margins, but the more work I do around it the more I see room for serious upside. Consider this: LQ’s whole owned hotel segment (i.e. what will become CorePoint after the spin) did $250m in Adj. EBITDA before corporate allocation on $842m in revenue in FY17.  Corporate overhead for all of La Quinta in 2017 (i.e. both owned hotels and the franchised business) came in at $42m (before stock comp). CorePoint is guiding that they did $207m in Adj. EBITDA in 2017. Yes, they’ll incur a bit of extra overhead as a standalone public company, but it basically seems like they’re guiding that CorePoint will inherit all of the corporate overhead from La Quinta. I’d be surprised if there wasn’t some cost cutting available post spin (as a quick reference, if they don’t cut any SG&A, their SG&A (excluding stock comp) as a % of revenue would be ~5% versus peers in the 3% range).
Why compare SG&A excluding stock comp? Obviously stock comp is a real expense, but LQ / CorePoint is a little funky right now given the split off and everything, so I feel like comparing across pre-stock comp numbers is a fairer right now.
Risk: Deal Collapse: I can’t see a regulatory reason for the deal to break (they’ve already gotten HSR), but deals can break out of nowhere. An obvious tail scenario for a break would involve a huge data hack at La Quinta. Ultimately, the deal breaking for a crazy reason is a risk I’m willing to take: I don’t think there’s tons of fundamental downside at today’s prices, management has proven themselves shareholder friendly, and, for what it’s worth, the proxy reveals other strategic interest in buying LQ.
Risk: La Quinta / Wyndham screws CorePoint: Certainly possible, but I’m comforted here by a few things:
CorePoint represented just under 50% of La Quinta’s total franchise fee in the first half of 2017. They are a critical partner for La Quinta; without CorePoint, the whole La Quinta franchise is completely subscale.
CorePoint just signed their La Quinta franchise agreement with multi-decade terms. The agreement was a point of negotiation in the sales process. The La Quinta CEO who put the agreement together is going to be the CEO of CorePoint. I doubt he’d sign an agreement that blows the company up.
Management agreements are common throughout the industry. If Wyndham / La Quinta tries to screw over their largest franchisee in CorePoint, what are the odds of them signing up other franchisees?
Risk: La Quinta / CorePoint hotels are not comparable to the peers I’ve comped them to. The publicly traded peer group is unquestionably a higher end peer group than CorePoint (there aren’t really great comps to CorePoint publicly traded), so it’s an open question if my assumption CorePoint can come close the margin (and trading multiple!) gap versus peers.
Just to show the difference among peers and CorePoint, INN’s ADR is just under $150 versus ~$85 for CorePoint. 
Still, I don’t think the ADR difference should prevent CorePoint from approaching peer margins. STAY, for example, has a bit of a different business model, but their ADR is <$70 and their hotel EBITDA margins blow everyone’s out the water. 
I’d also again point out that CorePoint was doing >35% hotel EBITDA margins as recently as 2014 (i.e. before the oil bust).
It is also an open question how much demand there will be for the CorePoint assets from acquirers, as basically none of them have exposure to the La Quinta system (and La Quinta is generally a step below the Premium Marriott / Hilton / Hyatt hotels most of them have focused on). 
Ultimately I think acquirers (whether it’s public companies or private buyers) will be very interested: CorePoint will represent a way to diversify and grow very quickly, and I think buyers will be excited once they start to see some upside momentum in the La Quinta franchise from Wyndham taking over the brand. 
Risk: (related to above) The reason margins are so low is these hotel assets aren’t that great, so earnings aren’t going to grow. This is a reasonable worry, as the same management team that has been overseeing these hotels will be going to the spin. Given margins have been subpar for the past two-tree years, are they really going to improve post spin?
It’s not like we’ve underwritten massive margin improvement: even at my projected earnings level, margins are still at the lowest end of peers, and I’ve really only underwritten some return from the capex projects and the hurricane closures rolling off. 
This margin dynamic / argument is somewhat of a classic spin dynamic. “You can’t underwrite them getting margins within spitting distance of peers; they’ve had years to do that and never come close.” I’ve seen that argument so many times and it always falls away once management has a massive equity incentive to focus on margin improvement in one specific segment…
As pointed out in the main write up, owned hotels have dramatically underperformed franchised hotels (particularly over the past two years), which backs up the thought that with more focus there could be substantial upside here. 
While management is heading to the spin, Wyndham is taking over the actual management of the properties, so how they perform will have much more bearing on improving hotel level EBITDA margins.
Risk: (related to above) Most peers are diversified among more premium brands, and the market will assign a discounted multiple to CorePoint due to concentrated La Quinta exposure: Again, a worry, but I take comfort in a few things:
Having a discount due to excessive exposure to one brand is catnip to diversified strategic buyers. If you trade at 10x and they trade at 12x and there’s synergies, they can offer a big premium at 11.5x and still find a very accretive transaction.
Private market values are also generally supportive of the valuations for LA Quinta hotels I’ve put out. In FY15 the company sold owned hotels at ~13x EBITDA (see Q4’15 earnings call), while in FY16 they sold assets in the 8 to 10x range (see Q4’16 call). Based on commentary around the 2016 sales, it seems like those assets were lower quality than the rest of the portfolio (EBITDA margins significantly lower than the rest of the portfolio’s already depressed margins). Put together, I think the private market sales we’ve seen support the valuation multiples I’m discussing.
Turning back to STAY, on their Q4 call they said their recent hotel sales were done at >15x EBITDA, which again enforces that a low ADR isn’t a barrier to a strong multiple and that the multiples we’re discussing above are by no means aggressive.
Given the leverage CorePoint will have, the cash flow to equity gets very interesting very quickly if shares trade too far down. CorePoint has guided ~9% of revenue as maintenance capex/year (see spin docs p. 133). That puts annual MCX at ~$75m, roughly in line w/ what they spent in FY2014 and 2015 (before the refresh cycle started). Just using LTM numbers, $207m in EBITDA and annual interest expense running ~$45m per year (their CMBS is L+275) would get you to free cash flow to equity should be $85-90m/year, or about $0.73/share, and growing very rapidly given both the operational and financial leverage (holding everything else constant but taking EBITDA to $240m would get you to just over $1.00/share in FCFE). Given this is a REIT, I think the potential high dividend yield (most peers trade in the 5-6% yield range) / share buyback potential (management was aggressive in repurchasing shares in 2015 and 2016) will provide strong support for shares if they trade anywhere near today’s implied prices.
Risk: economy collapses, earnings go to hell. Another big piece of the thesis is CorePoint is under-earning and will grow earnings aggressively post-spin, driven in large part by some operating / financial leverage and one-time items (hurricanes) rolling off. Unfortunately, leverage cuts both ways, and if the economy collapses room rates and earnings will join them. Again, I think you’re buying it cheap enough to justify that risk, and you could hedge it by shorting a basket of peers if you wanted to, but it’s a risk that certainly exists. FWIW the spin docs note that the CorePoint hotels weather the Great Recession much better than the average hotel.
Risk: Interest Rates Rise Rapidly; cap rates / yields rise with them. A lot of this thesis is based on “buy CorePoint at ~10x and wait for it to join peers at 11-12x”. That works great assuming peers stay at 11-12x, but if rates rise rapidly and all peers drop to 8x it’s a recipe for a capital loss. Unfortunately that’s a risk in all investments. I think you’re buying it cheap enough to more than make up for that, and you could hedge a basket of peers to somewhat protect yourself if you wanted to, but it’s certainly a risk.
Risk: Online Risk. I’ll use this as a catchall for AirBNB risk or Priceline coming out with a hotel brand. These are industry wide risks, and I tend to think a lot of these tail risks would hit the brands / franchisors harder than the hotels themselves.  FWIW, CorePoint thinks their select-service / midscale focused hotels are less exposed to AirBNB’s than other hotels, which makes sense to me.
Is this a taxable spin? I mentioned in the incentives piece that this is a taxable spin, which encourages management to keep the stock price lower to take less of a tax hit. This belief is backed up by both the original form 10 (from July) as well as my read of both the deal proxy (see p. 118) and the 2017 10-k (see the top of page 18). However, I’ve talked to several event desks who don’t think the spin will be taxable, and a deal like the current FOX / DIS spin lends further credence to this not being taxable at the shareholder level. I haven’t been able to confirm one way or another with LQ’s IR. If this isn’t a taxable spin, a bit of the incentive for management to keep the share price low falls through and a near term acquisition probably isn’t in the cards given the tax issues, but I don’t think the spin being non-taxable would change the major crux of this thesis.
Other ways of looking at valuation: Just to show I’m not cherry picking from one peer to make my point, below is a valuation slide from an AHT deck, which backs up that the valuations I’m using for CorePoint are likely conservative.

  Summary
  Optiva is a provider of mission-critical billing software to telecom companies. It is emerging from a
period of mismanagement and poor governance while under ESW control with a strong CEO, refreshed Board, and
high-quality shareholder base. Revenue should stabilize and return to growth over the next year as management
rebuilds the sales pipeline disrupted during the shareholder dispute over the past 18 months (more
broadly sales were not a focus under ESW management). Optiva is a potential long-term beneficiary of
the shift in telecom software to the public cloud and is beginning to look at M&A opportunities. The
company has no sell side coverage and has not held a public conference call in 18 months (will restart
next quarter).

This is not a situation to sharpen your pencil on your DCF. It’s a bet that an unusually strong
management, Board, and shareholder base for a company this size will make good things happen
against the long-term backdrop of a shift to the public cloud and potential for roll-up M&A. CEO John
Giere is highly aligned, having been granted 250k 10-year options at a C$42 strike while the two largest
shareholders aggressively opposed a takeover of the company at C$60 last year (though there’s some
nuance around whether the bid was bona fide).
    Background
  Founded in 1999, Optiva provides billing software to telecom companies. The software is mission-critical
because it underpins revenue generation for the telcos. The software is also sticky – it can take years to
switch billing providers. The company completed a couple large acquisitions, in 2012 and 2015, and ran
into financial trouble in late-2016 due to consistent underperformance on both revenue and
profitability.

Optiva was set to be rescued by Constellation Software before Texas-based ESW, controlled by
billionaire Joe Liemandt, swooped in with a slightly better offer in early-2017. ESW took control of the
company and pivoted the strategy towards public cloud. Revenue continued to decline under ESW
ownership, though restructuring boosted margins.
 


    Early in 2020, Optiva announced plans for a large financing (US$100 million at a time when the market
cap was US$200 million) with no clear use of proceeds. The financing appeared to be an attempt by ESW
to entrench its control of the business. This set off a battle with two Toronto-based funds – Maple Rock
and EdgePoint. The Toronto funds ultimately prevailed, took control of the company, and then
successfully defeated an attempt by ESW to acquire 100% of Optiva at C$60 per share. See this article
for the full story on the shareholder dispute: https://chaptertwelve.substack.com/p/optiva-the-goose-
that-laid-the-golden-egg.

Optiva hired telco software veteran John Giere as CEO in December 2020, granting him 250k 10-year
options at a C$42 strike. Previous CEO Danielle Royston, a long time ESW employee, had left the
company mid-year.

In early March 2021, ESW sold its remaining equity stake in Optiva to other shareholders, including
Maple Rock, EdgePoint, and OceanLink. The sale was done at C$40 per share. With this transaction, all
ESW-related governance issues at the company are resolved. Optiva raised US$20 million in a financing a
few weeks later at C$30 per share, principally from shareholders EdgePoint and OceanLink.
  Investment Thesis
  1. Optiva was super hairy a year ago, now it’s a clean story
    For the first time since 2017, ESW no longer has any role in the management or governance of the
company. Recently appointed CEO John Giere is a veteran of the telecom software space, the Board is
populated by several individuals with telecom and software experience (eg. Barry Symons from
Constellation), and the shareholder base is high-quality with three Toronto-based funds (EdgePoint, Maple
Rock, and OceanLink) controlling two-thirds of the equity (58% fully diluted).

Optiva did little investor outreach while under ESW control, has no sell side coverage and has not held a
public conference call in 18 months (will restart next quarter).
  2. Revenue should stabilize and return to growth over the next 12 months

Revenue has been on a persistent downward trend at Optiva. High switching costs mean that customer
decisions to change billing providers, perhaps in response to prior periods of uncertainty at the
company, can take years to materialize in reported results. Under ESW control, Optiva’s strategy was
extremely focused on moving customers to the public cloud. While likely to be the long-term future for
the industry, the exclusive focus on public cloud was premature and may have deterred some customers
from making long-term commitments to Optiva. ESW also underinvested in sales.

With the latest quarterly results, the company noted that revenue is showing an “early indication of
stabilizing at current levels.” Management has also made progress rebuilding the sales funnel. About
80% of revenue in the latest quarter was from recurring support revenue. The balance is from licenses
and services.

3. Profitability should be consistent

Adjusted EBITDA margins have been 20-30% in recent quarters. I expect margins to remain consistent in
this range with perhaps a bit of downside pressure as management invests more in R&D.

4. Long-term opportunity from public cloud and M&A

The telecom industry is lagging in the transition to the public cloud. I believe the shift will eventually
occur and presents an attractive opportunity for Optiva to grow revenue. They appear to have an
industry-leading public cloud offering, developed on Google Cloud while under ESW ownership.
I expect Optiva will eventually look at M&A opportunities, adding a software “roll-up” angle to the
investment thesis. Acquisitions could be within the telecom software space or verticals outside of
telecom where Optiva’s core competency in billing would be applicable (eg. utilities).
  5. Valuation

Optiva’s market cap is US$140 million, they have US$90 million of outstanding debentures, and US$26
million of net cash. There are 975k warrants outstanding to ESW (16% of fully diluted share count) with
a US$34 strike price. The debentures mature in 2025, carry a 9.25% coupon, and are majority held by
EdgePoint.

Annualized revenue based on the latest quarter is US$64 million and at a 25% margin adj. EBITDA is
US$16 million. The stock trades at about 3.2x revenue and 13x adj. EBITDA. This is a fair-to-rich multiple
for a legacy, declining software business, but revenue should (hopefully) be bottoming with good long-
term growth potential from public cloud and M&A.
I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

2019-11-15,Leo11,CYSM,COMMUNITY BANCORP SANTA MARI,https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/COMMUNITY_BANCORP_SANTA_MARI/2181214254,35000000.0,14.03,"Description
Community Bank of Santa Maria (CYSM) is nano-cap bank in California with only two branches and $250m in assets. Its focus is on lending to local small/medium sized businesses (mostly backed by real estate) and the bank seems to have carved out a successful niche for itself. Despite small size the bank manages to operate efficiently - generating good returns for shareholders while maintaining strong underwriting record. Recent actions by management suggest the bank might be getting positioned for sale. I would expect the bank to be sold at least at 50%-100% premium to current prices.
Average daily stock liquidity is under $50k so most likely this is suitable for PAs only.
CYSM is really cheap at only 1.18xTBV and TTM PE=11 with ROE of 11% and further profitability improvements projected for 2020 and 2021. The bank has doubled its assets and deposits since financial crisis. BV/share has compounded at 7.5% over the last 5 years and 11% over the last two. Loan loss provisions stand at zero since 2013 and totaled only 4.3% of assets (in aggregate) during the period of 2008-2012. To top it all off, insiders own 18% of stock and have been with the bank since it’s early founding days (1983 and 2001).
Aside from cheapness and strong historical track record I think CYSM is a timely investment now because:
Bank is overcapitalized and has just launched a tender offer to buy back 12% of outstanding shares (at $15/share). Pro-forma for the tender offer valuation drops to PE=10;
Insiders will tender only 2.5% out of 18% of their holdings. Only 3 out of 12 insiders are partially reducing their investments in the bank;
New CEO Janet Silveria took helm in 2015 and since then CYSM profitability has improved significantly, one of the three branches was divested in 2018 (as it was under-performing bank’s goals), annual dividend was initiated (albeit at only 1% level) and current tender offer is the first time company is returning material amount of funds to shareholders;
Most importantly, CYSM is a dark company with no regular SEC filings and with only limited disclosures on their website and FDIC. This is probably one the reasons why CYSM is so cheap relative to other banks. However, recently announced tender document has full dossier of disclosures about CYSM business, its credit portfolio and insiders. This new information when digested by investors might serve as a catalyst to propel the shares upwards.
Also worth noting, that recent profitability improvements do not seem to be driven by higher credit risk, but rather by cost structure efficiencies – yield on assets only improved from 3.6% to 4.5% (since 2015) and this was driven by higher yields on securities portfolio (U.S. Government and MBS) rather than loan portfolio, for which the yield has remained stable (c. 5.8%-6.0%). At the same time cost efficiency ratio improved from c. 80% in 2012-2016 to current 63% on TTM basis.
Given all of this, it seems the company is getting positioned for sale or at the very least moving generate better returns for shareholders. Bank transaction multiples in the Western U.S. stand at 1.6x - 2.0x TBV. The multiple would be even higher for a tiny-and-yet-profitable two-branch bank like CYSM due to obvious and easily achievable synergies. Thus in M&A scenario I would expect 50%-100% upside.
Compensation of 4 principal officers alone amounts to $1.2m, director compensation adds further $0.4m – so in total that’s already 20% of the annual cost base. Elimination of these expenses would push net income up by 50% and pro-forma PE down to 6.5x. And while some of these execs and their relationships with local businesses might be vital to generate new lending (it’s still a community bank), expense synergies seem to be abundant.
All execs have entered into change of control agreements entitling them for 2 year pay in case of bank sale and termination. However, the tender offer filling does not make it clear whether this is a recent development.
Both CEO and chairman (who co-founded the bank) have been with the company and its predecessor already for 36 years. A further 5 directors (also co-founders) have been with the company at least since 2001 when the Community Bank of Santa Maria was established (it was called Bank of Santa Maria since 1983). Average age of long time directors / co-founders is 80 - seems like a good time to cash out of their holdings in the company. It might be confirmation bias speaking, but I think these circumstances are supportive of the thesis that some kind of strategic change is likely to be in the works.
Final point on tender offer. Unaffected price before the announcement stands at $12.5. If the tender offer is over-subscribed shares are likely to revert back to this level. So waiting waiting till after tender expiration before establishing the position might pay-off. Also there is an odd-lot provision for some 'risk free' $100.
  Appendix: Historical financial data (mostly from FDIC):
Notes:
- Decline in assets and deposits during 2018 is due to sale of the third branch.
- Net income for 2018 has been adjusted downwards to exclude one-off items - gain on sale of branch and expense recovery from large vendor.

HAL:
  Summary
Halliburton (HAL) is available at what should turn out to be a very attractive price due to current concerns about commodity prices, North American rig counts, trailing margins and even possible spillover from the BP-Macondo liability trial.  I think these concerns will fade or are more than priced in and that HAL is on the verge of demonstrating significant positive earnings leverage and shareholder friendly cost and capital actions.
Thesis
 I think the company will shortly begin to differentiate itself vs. peers.
We think earnings next year could be north of $4.75 vs. current consensus around-$4.  At a discounted 12X that would imply a +40% gain from current levels.   2013 eps should be about $3.25 as HAL recovers from the guar debacle and as the international projects begin to ramp.
Management has been clear that NA margins bottomed at 12.4% in Q4. Getting back to a normal spread on Guar will add back at least 400 bps (they lost 600 peak to trough when they panicked and bought a ton-several actually-at the top)  Cost savings programs and better  utilization have the potential to add another 400 bps combined.  Management believes they can get back to 25% margins in this cycle, but probably need some improvement in nat gas drilling to get that high.  Note: Q1-13 should show the last of the higher cost guar inventory.  The full cost reduction potential may have to wait until the analyst day in Q3/Q4
In Latin America, HAL’s newly won contracts in Brazil will increase utilization and drive margin expansion over the next several years. Startup may hold back margins until ramped in H2-2013.
Other International (Co calls it Eastern Hemisphere) is seeing record project demand at excellent pricing.  This ramp should also produce strong top line growth and expanded margins going forward.
As the company’s mix shifts towards offshore the rev/margin mix should inflect.
Capital Returns: The company recently announced a dividend payout ratio policy of 15-20%. Thus, while only a 1.2% yield today, the significant 2013/2014 earnings ramp should drive equally aggressive dividend increases.
Current buyback authorization is $1.7bln, about 4% of current market cap. This program can expand as capex moderates in 2014 and beyond.
We expect FCF (before divs/buybacks) of about $2 and $3.50-$4 in 2013 and 2014 as margins ramp and capex tapers.

 “When the financial history of this decade is written, it will surely speak of the Internet bubble of the late 1990s and the housing bubble of the early 2000s. But the U.S. Treasury bond bubble of late 2008 may be regarded as almost equally extraordinary.”
-          Warren Buffett, Shareholder letter dated 2/27/2009  (2008 intra-day low on 10yr yields was 2.04%) 
  I don’t expect this idea to win any awards for originality as several variations of this thesis have been posted to VIC over the last several years. All I can say is that sometimes the consensus is correct and I view this as a true “not if, but when” situation that allows long-term investors to take advantage of a genuine time-horizon arbitrage.
  Investment thesis - U.S. Treasury bonds are a compelling short because:
¦ Real and nominal treasury yields are at the lowest levels ever and will eventually normalize
¦ Low yields limit the possibility of capital impairment
¦ Economic data and Fed signaling have made deflation a highly remote possibility
¦ The U.S. fiscal position is unlikely to materially improve
¦ Shorting levered ETFs provides additional upside

Situation overview
Shorting U.S. treasury securities offers multiple ways to win, including eventual interest rate normalization, inflation and further deterioration in the U.S. government fiscal situation. Nominal losses on an unlevered position are capped at <2%/year; the only way to lose more than this in real terms is under a regime of sustained deflation – a highly unlikely scenario not seen in the U.S. since the 1930s. Shorting levered ETFs provides additional upside via the inherent decay of these instruments.
  Treasury yields are near the lowest levels ever - Yields on U.S. treasury securities are currently near the lowest levels ever on both a real and nominal basis.  Nominal 10-year yields hit an inter-day low of 1.70% in September 2011 (vs. current yield of 1.78%), but prior to 2011 yields had not fallen below 2% since WWII. Ex-ante real interest rates are difficult to calculate prior to the development of an active TIPS market, but the best data I’ve seen suggests that long-term (20 yr +) real yields in the U.S. had not fallen below 1.2% over the last 100 years prior to 2008 vs. current real yields of approx. 0.75%.    
  Low yields limit the possibility of capital impairment
By definition, the most you can lose (in nominal terms) by shorting an unlevered 10-year treasury would be 1.78% /year if held to maturity. On a 5% position this would be less than a 0.1% annual loss to the portfolio. However, if yields went to 4% - an historically very low level (where bonds traded as recently as mid-2010) the short would make approx 18%.  Figure 1 shows the range of outcomes for shorting a 10 yr bond.

  Interest rates will eventually normalize
Real “risk free” interest rates represent the price of current consumption vs. the price of future consumption and are determined in the market by the intersection of the supply of money (i.e., savings) and the demand for money (i.e., investment). Currently, real 10-year interest rates are at ≈ 0%, implying that the marginal economic actor is indifferent between current consumption and future consumption due to a lack of projects that generate a positive rate of return. Real interest rates vary widely over time and estimates of a “normalized” rate are difficult to project accurately. However, in the absence of a savings imbalance, normalized rates are always well in excess of 0% for even a slowly growing developed economy, because even slow growth would provide investment opportunities that generated a positive rate of return.  I’ve asked several experts and no one I’ve spoken with was able to offer an example of sustainable real interest rates at or below 0% in a growing developed economy.
Furthermore, in order for rates to go negative for a sustained period, not only would there have to be a lack of investments with a positive rate of return, but also savings demand would have to be greater than the amount of output that can be stored (i.e., you would be better off buying a case of toothpaste than saving your money because in the future your money will buy less toothpaste). Thus, it is highly unlikely that long-term real interest rates will remain below 0% over an extended period of time.
  Economic data and Fed signaling have made deflation a highly remote possibility
While our nominal losses on an unlevered short of a 10-year bond are capped at <2%/year, real losses could be much greater if the U.S. experiences a sustained period of deflation. This is because we must repay our short position with nominal dollars in the future, and if the price level in the future is lower than it is today, these dollars will be more valuable when it comes time to repay the short.
In the modern era, only three major economies have experienced deflation and currently deflation appears highly unlikely in the U.S. In Q1 real GDP rose 2.1%, and inflation is steadily above 2%, signaling that the U.S. is not close to a deflationary environment. Furthermore, in January the Federal Reserve released the first-ever inflation target of 2%. This target is significant when one considers how aggressive the Fed has shown it is willing to be. During the current financial crisis, the U.S. has not experienced deflation; however, the mere threat of falling prices has spurred the Federal Reserve to increase its balance sheet to >19% of GDP today, from about 6% in 2007.
Of course, the world economy is volatile, and a worsening of the situation in Europe or Asia could cause deflationary pressure in the U.S. If Fed actions are not timed properly, this could indeed cause temporary deflation. However, given the economic problems deflation causes and the range of policy responses available to U.S. Congress and the Fed, after reaching out to several experts on the subject I am unable to construct a realistic scenario in which the U.S. would experience sustained deflation (for the record, I don’t consider Ron Paul winning the presidency as ‘realistic’).
  The U.S. fiscal situation could deteriorate further, causing rates to rise
The fiscal strength of the U.S. government depends on numerous macroeconomic and political factors that are impossible to forecast. However, it’s worth noting that U.S. government debt has risen 66% in only the last 3yrs and now stands at >100% of GDP for the first time since the 1940s. Thus according to the Government Accountability Office, in order for the debt-to-GDP ratio not to expand further, the U.S. needs to run a “primary” surplus (i.e., before interest) of 1.1% of GDP (or 4.5% of the 2011 budget) vs. a 2011 primary deficit of 5.5% of GDP (or 23% of the 2011 budget). Looked at another way, based on numbers from the Congressional Budget Office, even if one (rather generously) assumes that over the next 10 years government revenue as a percent of GDP rises 25%, borrowing costs rise 3% and U.S. real GDP grows at 2.5% annually, total debt will climb to 120% of GDP – a level on par with Italy and greater than Ireland and Portugal. 
I would emphasize that even over the long-term I don’t view U.S. fiscal insolvency as a “likely” scenario, but given the difficult political choices needed to fix the situation I don’t view it as impossible either.  Currently, treasury yields are priced as if there is no credit-risk to US government obligations.  Any material change in the perception of the solvency of the U.S. government would not only cause bond yields to rise dramatically, but could also trigger a complex series of events with a potentially dire impact to global capital markets. A short position in treasuries would provide a hedge in this scenario.  
  Shorting levered ETFs provides additional upside to this view
One way to express a view on Treasury yields is by shorting levered ETFs. For example,  the Direxion Daily 20+ Year Treasury Bull 3X Shares (NYSEArca: TMF) is a levered ETF that holds a combination of securities (mostly index swaps) to produce “daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of 300% of the performance of the NYSE 20 Year Plus Treasury Bond Index.” Since TMF is designed to replicate 3x the daily change in the index, the ETF must be rebalanced daily in order to increase the position when prices rise and decrease when prices fall. As such, the volatility of the underlying index will cause the value of this ETF to decrease over time even if the value of the index is unchanged.
For a simple example of how this works, supposed the underlying index rises 5pts on day 1 and falls 5pts on day two. Even though the index is unchanged, the levered ETF will lose value.
Figure 2: How volatility destroys value of a levered ETF
Day Index Value Index Performance 3x Index Performance Value of Investment
0 100      $100.00
1 105 5.00% 15.00%  $115.00
2 100 -4.76% -14.28%  $98.57
  Mathematically, the before –fee return formula for a 3x levered ETF is:
Annual return +1 = (1+ index return)^3 * exp(-3*(annual volatility^2))
  The average volatility of this index is about 17%, implying that TMF would be expected to lose over 8%/yr even if the index is flat.
The NYSE 20 Year Plus Treasury Bond Index has an approximate yield of 2.85%, an approximate average maturity of 27.5 years and a duration of 17.47 years.  Using this data we are able to calculate the relationship between long-term treasury yields and a short position in TMF as shown in figure 3.

Summary of Investment Thesis:  (i) high margin business in a well-structured industry, provides mission critical ingredients/additives into attractive growing and defensive end markets of Personal Care, Pharma, Coatings, (ii) strong Board of Directors following 2019 proxy fight, (iii) new CEO Guillermo Novo took over in January 2020, brought in a new senior management team, successfully completed bottom line cost/operating turnaround (modeled on his experience at Air Products), now focused on reinvigorating top line growth both organically and via M&A, (iv) clean balance sheet, (v) strategic asset, previously reported acquisition target of Croda (CRDA LN)

History/Business:
Company has undergone decade-long transformation from messy ~$9B revenue conglomerate to specialty portfolio today with $2.45B of revs (midpoint guidance); along the way, buying, selling and spinning (Valvoline) assets was emphasized over fixing/optimizing operations; material capital was also used to de-lever and buyback a lot of stock
Prior CEO had mandate to sell remaining non-core assets, restructure costs and integrate the go-forward businesses; his mixed performance and margin target miss led to activist involvement and a proxy fight (see proxy filings, current Board and holders list) that resulted in an upgraded Board and ultimately a CEO change
Guillermo Novo initially joined the Board and thereafter was named CEO:
Novo is a well-respected long-tenured executive; he played a senior role in the Air Products (APD) turnaround under Seifi Ghasemi and is now applying that same playbook to ASH:  replaced business unit heads, changed from a top down matrix management model to one that pushes P&L control / accountability / incentives to the business unit level
When APD spun out its Versum (VSM) unit, Novo was named CEO; during his tenure at VSM, he successfully executed, reinvigorated growth, drove material margin expansion and ultimately sold the company for $6.5B in a bidding war between Entegris and Merck KGaA
Business summary:
ASH ingredients / additives / specialty chemicals are mission critical to its customer’s end-product function yet represent a small % of that end-product’s COGS; in its regulated Pharma and Personal Care end-markets, ASH ingredients are generally specified in with long product cycles, intellectual property support and high switching costs
Operates in a well-structured industry with ASH, BASF, and parts of former DWDP holding a large combined market share
Key end-markets/examples:
Pharma:  key product is excipients in pills used for binding/disintegration/time release for solubility/digestion/assimilation; best business; sells into large pharma as well as generics; long product cycle, spec-ed in and regulated
Personal Care:  various ingredients for skin, hair, teeth applications, sold to large multinationals and regionals; need to be able to supply globally across plant network; spec-ed in/predictable/sticky/regulated, shorter formulation product cycles than in Pharma segment
Coatings:  market leader providing rheology (flow) and thickness control; critical supplier to all global coatings/paint players
Raw material inputs are varied but largely non-petrochemical based and ASH historically has exhibited price power to offset raw material changes; importantly, from an ESG perspective, its key cellulosics-based ingredients are naturally derived from wood/cotton pulp/linters; this is important also to support customer label claims 
Prior strategic interest:  in early 2018; Reuters and Bloomberg reported that UK chemical company Croda had talks to acquire ASH;  Croda (>$15B TEV, trades at 22x EBITDA), is widely viewed among the best managed specialty chemical/ingredients companies in the world and serves similar end-markets; Croda’s comparable business units have mid-high 30s EBITDA margins
Since early 2018 when talks reportedly ended, ASH sold its composites business for $1B, sold a smaller commodity business for $100M and is in the process of selling its adhesives business (see below); the remaining core ASH is now a smaller enterprise and a pure play specialty ingredients company, potentially making it a cleaner and easier target

Thesis/Catalysts:
Strong business, mid-turnaround:
Since Novo joined, the business has stabilized, operations through COVID were excellent, and the business has experienced an organic growth inflection in several key end-markets
R&D function and new product commercialization has been revitalized and should lead to enhanced organic growth starting in 2022 driven by recent wins
Pharma has been strong as has Coatings; Personal Care is the area which has seen uneven results driven by (i) some legacy business losses and (ii) delayed COVID re-openings in Europe and other parts of the world (~70% of ASH revenue is non-US)
Most recent quarter was a minor setback largely driven by (i) effects of Winter Storm Uri and (ii) COVID-driven supply chain/shipping issues; these were well explained by management and comparable companies all faced similar issues; ASH reiterated annual guidance and framed the issue as supply/timing driven while underlying demand remains strong
Margin upside:  (i) targeting 25%+ EBITDA, (ii) self-help from identified gross savings, $25M in SG&A and $50M in COGS, (iii) inherent operating leverage from incremental growth
Pending sale of Adhesives business:  recently announced strategic alternatives for this asset; very good business with mid-high 20s EBITDA margins; is a standalone operation within ASH and the last non-core, non-additives asset; I estimate gross proceeds of $1.1-$1.5 billion; proceeds to be used for additional bolt-on M&A and buybacks 
Bolt-on M&A:  recently closed acquisition of the Personal Care assets of Schulke & Mayr; attractive, accretive deal, paid ~$310M and I estimate $30-$35M of acquired EBITDA; complementary additives business, growth and margin accretive, further expands ESG offering
Upcoming investor day:  first under Novo and his new team to present the revamped story to the street, showcase new products and potentially set new financial targets
Valuation:  stock trades for 10.6x FY22 (September) EBITDA and 15.4x EPS (good proxy for FCF ~6% yield); leverage <2.5x; numbers are pro forma for Schulke acquisition and still include the Adhesives business
Stock trades at a ~5x discount EBITDA multiple to its specialty peers; I believe that continued performance, increased consistency and organic growth momentum will close the gap; assuming a 14.5x EBITDA multiple on forward numbers = ~$145 stock, up >60% on a 1-2 year horizon with upside optionality if ASH is ultimately acquired

Sallie Mae is a business that is recovering from a painful regulatory earthquake.  As a result, they are undergoing a massive overhaul. Investors have been rightfully concerned and dismayed by the one-two punch of the severe credit crisis and the government's desire to fundamentally alter the federal student loan programs. Nonetheless, Sallie Mae is dealing with it as best they can. With its common stock in the $11.50 to $12 range, I feel it is significantly 30%-70% undervalued today.

Right up front, I do think the stock is selling at a discount due to a mix of the following reasons:  

(a) the newly implemented Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 which eliminated new federally-guaranteed loans from being originated by private lenders, (b) complex securitized trust accounting that forces Sallie Mae to account for their sold securitized trusts on-balance sheet (c) uncertainty regarding the economy and the follow-on credit quality concerns of their private student loans (d) a general hatred of consumer-lending stocks, (e) the slowdown of private student loan originations due to higher federally-guaranteed loan limits, (f) no near term catalyst in the form of a sale or even a partial sale, and (g) management just announced that investors should not expect a dividend until at least the end of 2011 as they consider the lengthening of their unsecured debt structure a higher priority.

There are likely other reasons, but this list is long enough!   However, I believe there is value in Sallie Mae's common stock that isn't currently being recognized by the market.

Business Background:

Before getting into the valuation work, here is a little background for those not too familiar with the business.

After the massive change in federally-guaranteed student lending regulations with the enactment of the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 (just implemented on July 1, 2010), Sallie Mae should now be thought of as the largest pure-play private student loan lender in the US.  

Aside from private lending arm, Sallie Mae also runs a student loan collections business and a loan processing business for the various non-profit guaranty agencies related to the Education Department (ED) guaranty program as well as directly for the ED itself.  These can be considered their ongoing businesses.  Given the government's heavy involvement today, these are not high growth businesses at this point.

As mentioned, Sallie Mae's federally-guaranteed student loan origination business is finished as of July 1, 2010.  This was their bread-and-butter and without it, they are undergoing a big restructuring that involves significant head count and cost reductions over the next year.

In addition to their ongoing businesses, I contend they have real value that isn't apparent on their complex balance sheet in the form of Residual Interests, Floor Income and the Servicing Contracts related to their continued involvement with their big pile of federally-insured securitized student loan trusts.  This value is effectively hidden by the analytical challenges presented by the recent off-balance sheet vs. on-balance sheet accounting rule change implemented on January 1, 2010.

Student Loan Securitization Primer:

For those not entirely familiar with the student loan securitization process, here is quick primer.   For those that know the understand the securitization process, you can skip ahead.

Like all securities backed by receivables, typically there are multiple tranches created for each securitized trust.  Sallie Mae originates the loan, packages them up and sells them to a newly created trust.   The newly created trust pays for the loans with money raised by selling various debt securities that possess certain rights to the future principal and interest payment streams.

First, the Sallie Mae, the servicing agent, gets paid about 60 basis points annually (paid monthly) based on the outstanding principal of the loan pool, then the trust holds back some cash-flows that go into various typical reserve accounts, then the tranches get the payments in the order of preference.

The interest is paid at the agreed upon LIBOR-based rates to the various tranches.  Any excess interest, depending on the spread between commercial paper (more on this below) and LIBOR, will flow to the Residual Interest holder, Sallie Mae.   

When principal is paid back, the highest-rated tranches get paid off first until they are fully paid back, then the next tranche in line gets the subsequent principal payments, etc.  Remember, the Education Department (ED) guarantees that around 98% of the principal will be paid regardless of eventual default rates.  As a result, there is little-to-no credit risk in these pools.  And, again, at the end of this line of principal payments is the Residual Interest holder, Sallie Mae.

It is important to note that most, if not all, student loan securitized trust's debt securities pay a ""LIBOR plus spread"" to the security owners (that is, the owners of the tranches).  All of the payments into these federally-guaranteed student loan trusts come in as variable rate loans, usually based on spread above then-current commercial paper rates.  

Explanation of Floor Income:

There is something unique about securitized trusts backed by federally-guaranteed student loans and that is the Floor Income concept.

A confusing element of Consolidation federal student loans is that the actual student borrower often pays a fixed rate for the life of their loan.  This is called the ""borrower rate"".  However, the Education Department guarantees to the lender a commercial paper + spread yield.  This guaranteed yield is called the ""lender rate"".  This helps explain why securitized trusts backed by federally-guaranteed student loans basically all pay a floating rate to the security owners..

For loans prior to October 2006, if commercial paper rates falls enough - like now - Sallie Mae not only receives the ""commercial paper + spread"" rate but Sallie Mae is also entitled to get a special Supplemental Allowance Payment (SAP) from the ED that basically sets a floor on the rate that Sallie Mae gets to keep.  For these loans, the ED is also guaranteeing a yield floor for the the lender (a.k.a. Floor Income).

For example, let's say the lender rate is commercial paper + 250 basis points (let's say it totals 4.5%) and the student-borrower is actually paying a fixed 7%, then Sallie Mae is entitled to keep the 2.5% in Floor Income.  If, on the other hand, CP + 250 basis points totaled 8%, then Sallie Mae gets a 1% ""top-off"" payment from the ED.  The ED would subsidize Sallie Mae 1% in this case.  It was a win-win for the lenders like Sallie Mae.  Remember, the securitized trust debt is paid on a purely floating rate formula based on LIBOR.  So, you can see all of this amounted to a big subsidy provided by the ED.   

Unfortunately, the above applies to loans made prior to October 2006.  Predictably, and probably rightly, this floor income subsidy was eliminated.  

For 2007 and up until the new legislation that took effect on July 1, 2010, the ED eliminated the floor income subsidy payments.  For these loans, if CP rates fell, Sallie Mae was forced to remit back to the ED the positive difference between the borrower's higher fixed rate and the lender's lower CP + spread rate.  Now, if CP rates rose, then the ED stills pay the SAP payment that allowed the lender to get its guaranteed CP + 250 basis point payment.  In other words, floor income was eliminated and that benefit is remitted back to the ED.

The discussion of Floor Income appears all over the place in Sallie Mae's financial filings.  As you can see, this floor income is a variable amount depending on the level of interest rates.  This variable amount of the ED's possible SAP payments flows right through the securitized trusts and, if all goes according to plan, it finally settles into the account of the Residual Interest holder - Sallie Mae.   

Hedging Activities related to the Floor Income:

To hedge and monetize this variable stream of floor income cash coming from the ED, Sallie Mae has often entered into multi-year interest rate swap contracts with various counter-parties in order to lock-in this floor income for some time period ahead.   Additionally, they have also subsequently sold the locked-in floor income streams to yet other third parties in order to enhance liquidity.  For anyone reading their financial statements, all of this hedging and monetizing activity adds complexities to their balance sheet and income statements.

For example, it appears that the lump sum sales of this floor income must be amortized into the income statement over the life of the sold swap contract's life.  In other instances, the retained interest rate swap contracts must be marked-to-market on the balance sheet and these changes in the marks flow right through the income statement as well.   

Accounting for this derivative activity creates some undesired matching issues.  Because of the lack of fully-hedged accounting treatment given to these activities, the income statement often feels the brunt or benefit of the volatile derivative values while the natural offsetting balance sheet adjustments don't occur.  

Often the balance sheet asset - that is, the projected floor income embedded in the asset values sitting on the balance sheet-  remains unchanged yet the value of the interest rate swap contracts fluctuates via the income statement.  With true hedge accounting treatment - and I am certainly not a hedge accounting expert - I believe  there would be no income statement affect and all mark-to-market variations would by-pass the income statement and instead flow through some ""other comprehensive equity"" line.  

I feel the basic reality of what's going on with this floor income stream is not that complicated to understand.  By their choice, Sallie Mae sometimes sell off the ED-subsidized floor income streams and they sometimes simply try to lock-in for some period ahead the retained floor income via interest rate swap contracts.  To do so, it all requires the use of derivatives and complex hedge accounting.

This discussion above is admittedly complicated stuff, but I felt it was important to explain some of the reasons behind the complicated hedging activities that you'll see if you review of their financials.  

As I'll add later in what I admit is my weakest component of the valuation section, management has indicated that there is currently about $2.5 billion of projected, un-discounted, Floor Income embedded in their securitized trusts.  This Floor Income eventually accrues to the Residual Interest holder at the end of the line in these trusts.  That holder is Sallie Mae and this Floor Income is a non-trivial component of their value.

Which, finally, brings me to the valuation of SLM.

I like to think of Sallie Mae in multiple pieces.  

First, they have a servicing business.  Second, they provide some loan processing services as well as loan collections work for existing student loans.  Together, I refer to these two business lines as their ""non-interest-spread"" businesses.  Third, they act as a pure private student loan lender on about $11 billion in non-securitized or retained loans that they've funded with their own liabilities.  Fourth, they own Residual Interests on all of the securitized trusts that they've created over the years.   And, lastly, they are entitled to the embedded ED-paid Floor Income as described just above.  

Taken together, this is Sallie Mae.

Servicing Business:

Sallie Mae performs the loan servicing duties for their securitized trusts and for this they receive about $950 million annually to perform this function.  This works out to about 60 basis points annually on the outstanding balance of the securitized loan portfolios.  For those interested, they do receive different compensation for their different federally-guaranteed loan types that I described above.  They receive 90 basis points for the $46 billion in Stafford loans, 50 basis points for the $80 billion in Consolidation loans and they get about 60 basis points on the $24 billion of securitized Private Education loans.  

In addition to the servicing revenues on the securitized assets on their books, they also service another $11 billion in Private Education loans that have not been securitized.  They refer to these assets as ""unemcumbered assets"".  Based on the same math, a close approximation of their servicing revenue on these assets is about $65 million per year.  

To round out the servicing revenues that should be expected for 2011, I also want to add in the revenues that they will earn on the newly acquired $28 billion securitized loan portfolio from the Student Loan Corporation.  This deal is expected to close by year-end.  Again, based on similar metrics as above, this will add another $150 million annual to the loan servicing revenue.  

In total, we can expected that their loan servicing revenues will be about $1.15 billion per year.

Side note:  To make the accounting a bit of a pain to understand, this servicing income is not explicitly shown on their income statement.  It currently flows through the broad ""net interest income"" line.   I am told they are going to begin splitting it out explicitly in the Q4 reporting.  I think this will help transparency. .

Side Businesses:

Sallie may has a couple of side businesses.  

For the non-profit guaranty organizations contracted by the Education Department, Sallie Mae acts a collections agency that works on a contingency basis.  This line of revenue will be in decline given that newly originated federal student loans will be now be done directly with the ED.  Sallie Mae will also be doing future collections work for the ED on their newly originated direct loans.   

Therefore, while the guarantor-related collections business will be in decline as the previously underwritten student loans season or age, the collections business on the direct loans made by the ED will grow as ED makes more student loans.  The cross-over point of these two lines of business isn't something I've analyzed closely..

In addition to this loan collections function, they also provide back-office loan processing services for these guaranty agencies as well.  Confusingly, they call this line, ""servicing revenue"" instead of ""loan processing revenue"".   Nonetheless, this service includes origination paperwork and other loan processing done for the ED-appointed guarantors.  Now, with the ED making direct student loans, Sallie Mae will not be earning any more origination paperwork fees from the guaranty agencies, but they are now contracted to do other loan processing work directly for the ED.   Again, it seems the lines will cross eventually at some sustained revenue level..

In summary, while some segments of these side businesses are in decline due to the direct loan arrangement with the ED, other areas are going to grow over time.  In total, these side businesses currently bring in revenue of around $350 million per year.  

Adding this ""side business"" revenue stream to the ""servicing business"" revenues, starting in 2011 Sallie Mae will have about $1.5 billion in revenue with which to work.  As of the Q3 2010 report, Sallie Mae still had about $1.3 billion in run-rate operating expenses.  Management has been clear that they are targeting a run rate expense level of $1 billion by the end of Q4 2011.  It makes sense that there is still some significant cost cutting to come as the ED just took over the federal student loan business on July 1, 2010 date.  Obviously, investors are focused on seeing this operating expense base fall to $1 billion per year or lower.

Valuation of their ""Non-Interest Spread"" Businesses:

In an attempt to value just the combination of the ""servicing"" + ""side"" businesses - I'll refer to this collectively as their ""non-interest spread"" businesses - it makes sense to jump forward to 2012 and assume an operating income stream of $500 million per year.  That is $1.5 billion in recurring revenue minus $1 billion in operating expenses.  I would expect that their after-tax earnings on these ""non-interest-spread"" related business is around $325-$350 million per year or $0.60-$0.65 per share.  

Frankly, the ""non-interest spread"" businesses are not going to get a big multiple as they are inherently slow growth / stagnant / or possibly shrinking businesses as the existing loans pay down over time.  For this ""non interest spread"" business, as a rough estimate, I would only assign a multiple of 6-8 times earnings to it.   This works out to be about $3.50 to $5.00 per share.  

Value of $11 Billion in Non-Securitized or Unencumberered Loans:

To isolate the value of the Residual Interests that Sallie Mae has embedded in their securitized loan pools, it helps to first isolate out the $11 billion in non-securitized Private Education Loans loans (referred internally as ""unencumbered assets"") on their balance sheet.  

As originally underwritten, these private loans were meant to make a pre-provision spread of 3.5% over their funding costs.  At a 3.5% spread, I estimate there is about $400 million of pre-tax, pre-provision net interest income.  

From this, they have stated that they expect to experience 6% in credit losses over a six year time-frame or about 1% per year.  It only averages out to 1% per year as they expect to experience heavier losses in early years and fewer losses in the later years on a particular loan pool.   

Based on these figures, they target earning 2.5% pre-tax on this $11 billion or about $275 million.  After tax, this could be estimated to be around $175 million per year.  I am not hitting this revenue with any overhead or administrative costs as these operating expenses have been fully incorporated in the ""non-interest-spread"" businesses in the section above.   

As a rough way of estimating the value of this income stream, it makes sense to use some embedded ROE target.  Using a 20% ROE target, as provided to me by Sallie Mae, implies that there is about $1 billion in shareholder equity backing this net income stream.  This ties reasonably with idea that this lending business uses about 10x leverage.  Another rough estimate is to give it apply a multiple of 8-10x earnings.  The combination of the two methods values it at $1 billion to $1.75 billion - a wide range.

However, we all know that this $11 billion of unencumbered asset pool was underwritten quite poorly during the heydays.  This means there are some losses to fund via existing loss reserves.  

Today, taking a pro-rata 30% of their $2 billion in reserves that Sallie Mae currently has backing their entire $35 billion private student loan pool (including the securitized private student loan trusts), I figure that there is about $600 million in loss reserve backing this $11 billion unencumbered loan pool to cover projected credit costs over time.  Assuming this is sufficient and released over the life of this loan pool, I then subtract this $600 million from the $1 billion to $1.75 billion value placed on this block of loans and estimate that Sallie Mae's $11 billion Non-Securitized Loan pool is probably worth $400 million to $1.1 billion or about $1.00 to 2.00 per share.

It might be important to note that things are improving with regard to default, delinquency and forebearance rates on this block of loans.  Nonetheless, to be reasonable and conservative in my assumptions, subtracting $600 million in loss reserves makes sense for the purpose of value estimation.  

Given these assumptions, the total value attributable to the ""non-interest spread"" businesses + the ""unencumbered assets"" pool results in an admittedly wide range of $4.50 to $7.00 per share.  

Residual Interest:

Which brings me to the next - and largest - value component of Sallie Mae; the Residual Interest holdings in all of their related securitized trusts.  And, believe me, this isn't an easy thing to pinpoint as these Residual Interests are inherently long-tailed and very assumption dependent.  Additionally, the on balance sheet accounting treatment required for securitized trusts makes it doubly hard to isolate this value..

From my estimation, there are a few ways to reasonably estimate their value to Sallie Mae.

First, Sallie Mae gave a reasonable hint of a rule-of-thumb valuation tool for their Residual Interests.  On January 1, 2010, new accounting rules dictated that Sallie Mae bring $35 billion of securitized trusts back onto their balance sheet.  In doing so, they erased an estimated $1.8 billion of Residual Interest value sitting on the asset side of their books.  This showed that, based on Sallie Mae assumptions on prepayment speeds, discount rates, etc., that they internally valued their Residual Interest at about 5% of the securitized trust assets.  This $35 billion was made up of a particular mix of Stafford, Consolidation as well as private student loans.  So, like most things involving these Residual Interests, it is a rough rule-of-thumb, in my opinion.

Second, back in early July and now posted on their website, Sallie Mae further provided an estimation of the ""excess spread income"" they expect to receive the principal amount of $121 billion of securitized federal student loan trusts (referred to as FFELP loans) that had on their books as of June 30, 2010.  This ""excess spread income"" is what is due to the Residual Interest holders.  

Based on this projected cash flow stream and using a rough 10% discount rate, the described $9 billion of non-discounted excess interest spread over the next 23 years is likely worth $5 billion.  This estimation values the Sallie Mae's Residual Interests at about 4.15% of the loans.   

By the way, about 50% of this ""excess spread income"" comes in the next 6 years.  It is a front-loaded stream of cash flow and makes the discount rate a bit less important in the analysis.

Before using these two indications of value, as of the start of 2011 Sallie Mae will have a Residual Interest position on a block of approximately $180 billion of securitized trusts on their balance sheet.  This $180 billion includes the $28 billion from the Student Loan Corp. acquisition as well as the $24 billion in securitized private student loans on the books.  These two items help explain the difference from the $121 billion that Sallie Mae used in early July.

Using these two valuation yardsticks, I'd estimate that their Residual Interests are worth, before taxes, $7.5 billion to $9.5 billion.  After tax, assuming corporate tax rates, this equates to about $5 billion to $6 billion or $9.50 to $11.50 per share.

I must say that also tried to use a third valuation marker laid down by their recent portfolio purchase of Citi's Student Loan Corporation.  They paid $1.2 billion for both the servicing rights as well as the Residual Interest positions on the $28 billion securitized loan pool.  Obviously, they did purchase this at a discount but given that this acquisition included both the servicing rights as well as the Residual Interests, the price paid does not fully jive with our above 4-5% rule-of-thumb.   

Looking at this marker more closely, given that they will get about $125 million per year in servicing revenue to start, I estimate that the servicing contract value of this $28 billion acquisition is likely worth around $400-$500 million.  By default, this leaves about $700-$800 million attributable to the Residual Interest holdings.   I would expect that the Student Loan Corp. did sell at a discount of 10%-20%.  Excluding this this discount equates to a 3%-3.5% rather than 4%-5% metric.  

I fully admit that this is a worthy counter-point to my above valuation of the Residual Interest, but for whatever reasons (including possibly self-serving ones) Sallie Mae has expressly cautioned against using the Student Loan Corp. portfolio acquisition as a metric for valuing their own Residual Interest value.

Value of Floor Income:

Finally, at the Barclay's conference in September, CEO Albert Lord estimated that $2.5 billion of embedded Floor Income was expected to come in over the next 23 years.  This cash flow was in addition to the expected servicing and excess spread income depicted in their July disclosure posted on their website.  

Some of this Floor Income has already been economically hedged (and some of the hedged cash flows have been sold) while the remaining cash flow is still set to fluctuate as interest rates change in the future.  This is an inherently volatile set of cash flows.  As a rough estimate, this $2.5 billion in gross cash flow on a discounted basis is likely worth somewhere in the range of $2-$3 per share.  This is admittedly a guess and admittedly the weakest component of my valuation work..

Preferred Stock Outstanding:

Following the conversion of the still outstanding $810 million SLM Preferred C shares into 33 million more shares, Sallie Mae will still have about $565 million in outstanding preferred stock outstanding.  This is approximately $1.00 per share of equity that is owed to other than common stock holders and must be subtracted.

Total Estimated Value.

All told, Sallie Mae's five components of value; their ""non-interest spread"" businesses (servicing business + side businesses), their $11 billion unencumbered private student loan assets, their Residual Interests in their securitized trusts and the value of their expected ED-paid Floor Income totals approximately ($3.50-$5.00) + ($1.00-$2.00) + ($9.50-$11.50) + ($2-$3) per share - ($1.00)= $15-$20 per share.  

Sallie Mae certainly has enough negatives to go around as laid out at the beginning.  However, I would say the biggest negative at this point lies in the fact that there is no near-term catalyst to point to that would shock the market into recognizing the value in one fell swoop.  Nonetheless, with Sallie Mae's earnings guidance of $1.50 per share for 2011 and with the cost cutting underway in earnest, I believe that there is inherent value in Sallie Mae's common stock at $11.90 today.

  • 10 year saga, light at the end of the tunnel
• At ~50 cents on the dollar, meaningful upside remains with more certainty than ever
• Administrative activity in the next 1-6 months will push shares towards par
• Court developments compress the timeline
• Uncorrelated to the broader market
  Most of you are probably familiar with Fannie and Freddie (the “GSE’s”) and their saga since the
financial crisis. For more background see Socratesplus’s write-up or the 1259 and counting pages of
discussion on the Corner of Berkshire.
  If not, here is the quick summary:
  • Financial Crisis – every levered financial co is blowing up, the GSE’s are arguably the backbone of
the American economy, and the US gov’t steps in with essentially unlimited funds to support the
GSE’s
o US takes 10% running and 80% of the equity in warrants. GSE common shares go to zero
and the junior preferred shares (the ones we are pitching today) go to pennies on the
dollar
• Post Crisis
o Housing starts to recover, US economy starts to recover, GSE’s get their house in order
(see what I did there), and although they have not kept up with the 10% running owed
to the gov’t (and have a PIK option), they are about to start printing money as they did
for most of their history
• 2012 
  3rd Amendment/Net Worth Sweep
o On the eve of massive profits, the US Treasury changes the 10% running into 100% of
everything
o At the time, it seemed shady and now it’s just criminal
o Preferred shares had climbed ~400% to 10 cents on the dollar, collapsed ~70% back to
cents on the dollar
• Lawsuits
o Perry, Fairholme, and a whole bunch of people sued over the 3
rd amendment
o The lawsuits are ongoing, have mostly been defeated, but…
o Fairholme has uncovered numerous documents via discovery that don’t look good for
the government and still has a shot at their lawsuit
• Since
o The lawsuits progressed, congress did some stuff
o The preferred shares rallied up near 50 cents on the dollar in 2014 and then…
o Judge Lamberth tossed out the Perry lawsuit with the justification that the “government
can do what they want”, more or less
o The preferreds dropped ~70%
      o Trump was elected and his Treasury Secretary, Mnuchin, said GSE reform is a priority
and will be done super-duper, bigly fast with the help of congress
o The prefs went from ~15 cents on the dollar to ~40 cents on the dollar in late ’16, early
‘17
o Turns out tax reform, repeal of Obamacare, etc were more important than GSE reform
and Congress was not helpful
o Prefs drifted back down to ~25 cents on the dollar for most of ’17-‘18
  Now, what has happened recently to change the calculus on the “always on the come” preferreds?
Simply, Trump appointed Mark Calabria as the head of FHFA, the GSE’s regulator, and he has been
explicit about ending the conservatorship and doing it quickly. Importantly, as head of FHFA, he has sole
authority to release the GSE’s and end the net worth sweep.
  Trump issued a directive for Treasury and FHFA to provide plans for GSE reform. Calabria has been doing
a speaking circuit talking about a potential 2020 IPO. My guess is these claims get walked back to a more
reasonable timeline, but the cow is out of the barn and GSE reform is coming. The Prefs have rallied
back to roughly 50 cents on the dollar and are up roughly 100% year to date.
Why now? Isn’t the Calabria rhetoric priced in?
  “Whether we can do some kind of conversion with preferreds, or whether they would get
par, it’s way too early to figure that out.” – Mark Calabria, CNBC, May 20, 2019.
  We don’t think so. We think the next 3-6 months will cement the path forward and the market will begin
to discount some recovery some 2-3 years in the future. We believe active court cases and decisions
expected in the next year will hold the administration to the expressed timeline of “late 2019”.
    Immediate par recovery is possible we suppose, but we think unlikely. A par recovery 3 years out, after
many machinations of capital raise and restructuring, discounted back at 15% per year would be about
65 cents on the dollar or another 30% from here. A 10% discount rate on a 2 year time horizon would be
~80 cents on the dollar or a 60% return from here. You can use whatever discount rate you prefer and
whatever time horizon, but we believe this trade is morphing from “hail mary” to regular way “merger
arb” and the required return for the market is dropping from multiples of capital to ~10% IRR. There is
still meat on the bone and it is likely to be realized in the next 6 months.
  There are many different preferred issues that trade for both FNMA and FHLMC. I used FNMFO because it is the one trading at the largest discoutn to face value.
  Happy to add more in the comments.

I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

We recommend a short position in Reynolds Consumer Products (NASDAQ: REYN). Covid’s well-publicized impact on at-home consumption and a commodity tailwind have boosted numbers, but 2020 should represent peak earnings.
REYN went public in January 2020 at $26 per share, pricing slightly below the midpoint of the initial range of $25-$28.  Capital allocation messaging has been to pay down debt (IPO went to market at 3.7x Net Debt / EBITDA) and to pay out 50% of net income in the form of a dividend.  The Rank Group, controlled by Graeme Hart, owns ~75%. They did not sell any shares at IPO and their lockup expires 7/29/2020.
The business is separated into four categories and we will focus on the two largest:
Reynolds Cooking & Baking – traditional aluminum foil and baking related essentials.  Dominant market share with full distribution and revenue driven by commodity pricing. We see this as a solid cash flow business that is defensible.  Reynolds manufactures the aluminum and is the only player in the space that is vertically integrated.  Market share is ~70% (~60% of the share is branded) and Reynolds is the only major brand name in the space with limited private label exposure relative to the balance of the portfolio. 
Hefty Waste and Storage - food storage bags and the branded Hefty Trash bags. The key competitors in the space include Glad (CLX) and Private Label. The primary channel for REYN is Walmart (WMT). While the company only discloses consolidated exposure to WMT (43% in 2019), we believe WMT represents a greater proportion of this business. From a pricing perspective, the Hefty brand sits between private label and Glad. 
Source: REYN 4Q20 Earnings Presentation
  Our diligence suggests some clear areas of deficiency for REYN, as well as a lack of leadership. We cannot remember an instance of such high turnover at the executive level.  The only executives with significant tenure are CEO Lance Mitchell and CFO Michael Graham, who have been in their respective roles since 2011 and 2016. 
Key division presidents have significantly less tenure.  We see this as odd timing for the former presidents to leave ahead of an IPO. 
Francis Arseneault - Hefty Waste & Storage, President since 2019
Craig Cappel – Reynolds Cooking & Baking, President since 2018
Rachel Bishop – Hefty Tableware, President since 2019
Our key diligence conclusions:
Innovation is lacking, management is not willing to invest in the business and has been unwilling to pursue M&A to drive growth.  Leverage likely prevents material M&A at current levels
Categories are mature and innovation is not driving growth.
Distribution gains are largely not available; the bigger risk is decreasing brand selection from the shelf.
Foam plates and the disposable portfolio are out of favor with enviornmentally conscious consumers and retailers.
We see the Cooking & Baking category as a clear winner from COVID, similar to many CPGs.  Our primary concern is related to the commodity backdrop as we exit 2020.  Our calls suggest that it takes roughly 6 months for declines in aluminum to flow through to the bottom line. As a result we expect 2H20 to be strong as COVID strength is amplified by a deflationary commodity backdrop.  Expectations are for roughly flat Y/Y EBITDA growth in 2021 off a very difficult 2020 comp, which we see as unrealistic even without aluminum inflation.
  Moving to the highest margin segment, Hefty Waste and Storage.  Our primary concern is related to the shift to private label.  Retailers are putting a greater emphasis on private label and we see significant margin risk to REYN.  Given the large exposure to WMT mentioned above, we expect volume to shift from Hefty Branded to WMT’s Great Value.  We do not expect to see expanded shelf space and expect Hefty to lose share.  Our diligence suggests that Hefty trash bags have significantly higher margins than REYN’s private label bags.  We see serious ramifications of lower margin mix in the trash bag business, potentially impairing REYN’s ability to market the Hefty brand (with lots of John Cena commercials), in order to preserve margin. 
If we think about the innovation that has been introduced, it was led by Glad and CLX with Force Flex.  For both CLX and the consumer, Force Flex was a game changer and justified a premium price.  In 2016, CLX lost its patent on Force Flex and trash bags are now a commodity product as Force Flex has made its way to private label and put downward pressure on brand pricing.  We are unlikely to see anyone develop another Force Flex technology that is both value-add to the consumer from a usability perspective and economic to the manufacturer as resin was actually removed from the bag which drove margin. 
WMT’s private label with CLX’s Force Flex technology:

  We find it interesting that AMZN’s Solimo branded trash bags already occupy two of the top five best sellers in the trash bag category on Amazon.  To us, this emphasizes private label’s traction with the consumer in the category.  While REYN does manufacturer Solimo, we see this as a slippery slope in a zero growth category as private label gains share and REYN loses Hefty margins.  This also has potential to accelerate WMT’s shift to private label, particularly with the latest Walmart+ initiative.  But the biggest risk is losing shelf space at WMT.  We do not see the value of multiple branded trash bags (Glad & Hefty) at WMT when the technology is no different than WMT’s Great Value brand.  Glad’s premium price point offers WMT a better value proposition at the high end, while private label is clearly a more economic option at the low end.

  Similar to most CPGs, we do not think 2Q20 estimates are high enough but believe buyside estimates are significantly higher than 2020 EBITDA guidance of $695-$715 and current consensus of $715m.  While guidance appears to be achievable based on current scanner data, we see risk to buyside expectations and EBITDA growth into 2021. 
We would also highlight the potential conflict of interest for the Rank Group. Currently Rank, through its portfolio company Pactive, has arm’s length agreements with REYN.  While we do not know the terms or the timeline, we find it hard to believe that the supply chain efficiencies will persist in the long term.

  We believe REYN should trade like a slower-than-GDP grower with significant headwinds from private label pressures.  REYN is currently trading at ~13x EBITDA.  We think REYN should trade at a discount to KMB’s ~12x multiple given: (i) private label exposure and trade down risk out of branded; (ii) concentration with WMT; and (iii) a balance sheet that limits capital allocation. In a more dire scenario, THS could represent the best private label comp, and it is currently trading at

  DISCLOSURE:  We and our affiliates are long Amarin (AMRN), and may long additional shares or sell some or all of our shares, at any time.  We have no obligation to inform anybody of any changes in our views of AMRN.  This is not a recommendation to buy or sell shares. 
    Amarin (AMRN) is a drug development company that 9-12 months away from completing and releasing the results of a Phase III trial for their Huntington’s Disease drug, Miraxion, that could dramatically transform the company over the next few years from $2.50 a share to a likely valuation of $18 with a possible valuation of more than $50 dollars per share in a favorable scenario. 
  What makes Amarin attractive is that is the second time at bat for their drug application and we can statistically study the past to predict the likelihood of approval this time around.  On the other hand, Miraxion’s active agent is similar to over the counter (OTC) Fish Oil supplements and combined with a checkered company history and no US analyst coverage, it’s easy to pass on the idea, masking an excellent and researchable risk reward for those willing to dig a little deeper.  These key factors have led to an incredible mis-pricing and an investment that presents a compelling opportunity as we explain below. 
    Huntington’s disease (HD) Primer:
HD is a a neurodegenerative (brain wasting) lethal, & genetic orphan disease (not common) affecting 30k patients in the US with 150-200k patients at risk.  Typical onset occurs around the age of 30 and death is certain within 10-20 years of onset.  HD destroys cognitive abilities and motor functions, leading most victims to die of complications such as breathing or choking. 
  Huntington’s is believed to be caused by abnormal protein functions in the brain that break down neural communication.  This is measured by the CAG repeat score – essentially the level of abnormal cell repetition in the brain, or the biochemistry disruption.  The CAG score can be accurately measured with the normal US population having a CAG repeat score of 20-30x while HD patients have at least 36x and can go as high as 128x.  The only treatments available today offer little remedy and can only mask the side effects of the disease.  The market for HD treatment is ~ $2.5B market in the US. 
    Drug Profile:
Miraxion, or Eicosapentaenoic Acid (Ethyl-EPA) is an essential fatty acid of the Phospholipids family.  Phospholipids are responsible for maintaining membrane structure, protein functioning, cellular signaling, and gene regulation.  As skeptics note, Miraxion is a purified and controlled form of the omega 3 fatty acid that can be found in OTC Fish Oil supplement pills at GNC etc.  Miraxion is believed to help the patient by improving some of the motor functions & cognitive processes that are quickly eroded by Huntington’s, though it is not a miracle drug. 
  1st Time at Bat. A History of Miraxion Drug Trials:
In 2000 Miraxion went through a series of trials that were completed in 2003.  Initial results showed an ambiguous benefit overall and the primary endpoint, Total Motor Score 4 (TMS-4) improvement over placebo, was not met with statistical significance in the“intent to treat” (ITT) patient group (135 patients), or the total trial population.  The FDA approves or rejects New Drug Applications solely on the results against the primary endpoint.  Although Miraxion did not meet the primary endpoint, benefits were shown in subsets of the patient population.  Importantly, Miraxion was shown to be remarkably safe and well tolerated.   
  There are plausible explanations for why the results were sub par and why the current trials have a much better shot at producing a statistically significant result.  To start, a large number of patients in the ITT group did not follow trial procedures and jeopardized results.  Some examples include:  9 patients failing to take the full dosing regimen, 9 taking prohibited drugs during the trial that interact with Miraxion, skewing results against placebo, and 20 patients waited too long to get screened for final results.  If you back out these patients who did not follow protocol, you are left with the Per Protocol (PP) group of patients who followed the guidelines accordingly.  As would be hoped, The PP group, (83 patients) scored much better than the ITT group and came very close to reaching statistical significance.  Statistical significance in pharma land is considered P value < .005. 
  Interestingly, after the trial was published, an even more thorough analysis of the data was performed that broke the patients down into both PP/ITT groups and by ranges in the CAG score.  This breakdown showed an even more profound result, with the PP group in the less than 45x CAG scoring camp displaying remarkably positive and statistically significant results P = .006.  The map of scores per group are presented below and an explanation of the significance will follow:

      The map above shows that overall the trial looked weak on primary endpoints but that there was a significant and meaningful response in the subset of patients who followed the protocol and had a below 45x score on their CAG testing.  We do not want to exaggerate the improvement, 15-20% is good, but not incredible, especially given the fact that motor function is improved but the HD progression is not actually reversed.  Regardless, it is an improvement in a disease where every benefit counts in the patients view, and a benefit they are willing to pay to experience.  Since we now have the data for their first time at bat showing a subset that scored well enough to pass FDA standards, two questions must be asked to decide if the historic data can be statistically analyzed to predict the outcome of a future trial. 
  1) Do the results make logical sense given what is currently known about Huntington’s Disease, or is this a random response in a small group (n=44) of patients?
  2) Is this an over fit of the data (dropping out all the patients till a certain outcome appeared), or is an actual positive response occurring? 
  Our research suggests the results are logical and the data was not over fit:
    1) Do different outcomes for each CAG scoring group make sense?
Much research shows that the CAG score is directly related to age onset of the disease and to some degree, the severity of onset and how rapidly the brain function is attacked.  The following CAG scores are rough estimates of CAG score vs. age onset:
CAG score  /  ~ Age onset of HD
20-30 =  normal population score and no onset of HD
36-39 =  60 years
45 = 37 years
55 = 20 years
65+  = childhood onset, extremely severe
  It is believed that with a high CAG score and early onset comes a more severe onset of the disease and a more abnormal brain chemistry.  Experts we worked with believe that the Miraxion results makes sense scientifically, as a severely impaired brain might not respond well to treatment, where as a moderately impaired brain could have a more dramatic improvement.  This is made even more evident when looking at the primary endpoint of TMS-4, which measures motor function, cognitive abilities, behavior, and functional abilities.  A severely impaired brain experiencing rapid onset of HD might degenerate too quickly for a positive response to be seen. 
  2) Has the data been over fit or doctored?
Given the sheer magnitude of drop outs and the proportion of dropouts to per protocol patients, on the surface the Miraxion trials do seem to suffer from doctoring or over fitment.  For example, a recent trial we have studied at a large pharma co. had 1000 patients and less than 20 drop outs.  Given the unique circumstances of Huntington’s disease the drop outs seem reasonable.  1) Roughly half of Huntington’s Disease patients are already taking supplements including Fish oil.  To go 12 months without taking your supplement (if you believe you’re getting placebo sugar pills) would easily compel a patient to break his/her protocol every now and then.  Frequent blood tests of patients can show if a placebo patient is taking a EPA related supplement that would easily skew placebo to control group results. Since patients were outside of a controlled setting like a hospital room given the long duration of testing @ 1 yr, it makes sense that some dosing was skipped or neglected.  Lastly, not being tested in a reasonable period of time for final results can be rationally explained, as a rare disease like Huntington’s makes population density harder to come by.  Some patients were located hours from the testing center and out of reasonable reach, as was the case here. 
  Skeptics at heart ourselves, we also decided to consult with doctors who were very close to the original trials and have analyzed the data independently. It was their opinion that the data had not been over fit and that there was indeed a strong response for a subset of patients. 
  It should be noted that there are blockbuster drugs today whose mechanisms of action (MOA) are not well understood.  Blockbuster Psychiatric drugs for instance, working through similar mechanisms as Miraxion in the brain, are still not well understood after decades of use.  Sometimes, with a promising compound, it’s simply a matter of testing enough patient populations till the desired result can be demonstrated in a test and accepted by the FDA.  We think that statement has some application here. 
  2nd Time at Bat.  Application of old facts to new trial:
After analyzing the historical trials and the plausible reasons for results it is then possible to take the old results as factual evidence and apply it to a framework for predicting the probability of future approval.  Since we have now seen that the subset of CAG < 45 of patients yielded a strong and positive result, the current trial design must focus on enrolling a high number of low scoring CAG group patients to produce a similar result.  The problem with testing patients prior to enrollment and only accepting CAG < 45 patients is that it would be viewed as coercive and not all patients want to have their CAG score tested.  Therefore, the following changes have been to the enrollment criteria to enrich the trial with the better responding patient pool. 
  Comparing the original trial enrollment criteria to the new trial patient enrollment criteria (which can be found at www.clinicaltrials.gov) it is clear that there are 4 new items/changes all aimed at targeting a lower scoring CAG patient mix, including:
  1) Modified age eligibility to minimum of 35
2) Total Functional Capacity (TFC) score exceeding 7  
3) Dystonia score less than 2
4) Chorea score greater than 2
  Most importantly, management claims that in close preparations with the Huntington’s Study Group, who is running the current trial, Amarin was given access to their database of thousands of Huntington’s Disease patients.  Using these parameters against that database of patients medical scores and background, yielded a 90% probability of the patient having a low < 45 CAG score!  Although we believe their claims, we studied the enrollment criteria with professionals to see how much factual evidence there is for an enriched patient population of low scoring CAG counts in the new trial. The findings backed management’s claim.   
  Higher age onset combined with only accepting stage 1 and stage 2 HD patients should naturally exclude high CAG scoring patients that are less likely to see a response.  This age was bumped up from “at least 30” in the last trial. Referring back to our age onset vs. CAG score should demonstrate how age and CAG score can enrich the trial population to below 45 CAG.  Under a few assumptions, the available statistical baseline information in the TREND trial base line frequencies for TFC can be statistically analyzed for the current trial.  With the new parameter of greater than 7 TFC score, it fits that 66% of the patients will fit the lower CAG group, using patient scoring and breakdowns from the previous trial.  While the multivariate statistical data is not available for the Dystonia score and the Chorea score to conduct a similar analysis, all of the literary material suggests that the scoring on these eligibility criteria will further improve the odds of enriching the trial with low CAG score patients.  We don’t think a 90% enrichment can be far off from the truth. 
  If 90% of the patients are in the low CAG group, further statistical analysis of the old trial results would suggest that the current trial has between a 95 and 74% chance of passing the FDA requirements.  These two scores are based on results from all 6 original testing centers and 5 of the 6 testing centers, respectively, and using two statistical methods of deduction.  (Note - the publication only provides statistical info to run this analysis on the ITT group, so this doesn’t even take the PP group scoring breakdown into account, which is only released by the co. and not in a fashion that allows for a statistical analysis to be run.  Therefore, higher values would be likely).  For accuracy, we backed out one of the 6 centers, where it was noted in the trial publication the lead physician had a financial interest in Amarin, though we do not believe foul play is involved.  Unfortunately, statistics are not the real world so this # is naturally lower, but high nonetheless.
    Other Issues Masking the Opportunity:
  Fish Oil vs. Patented Drug, Pricing Power, small end market
One major point masking the opportunity is that skeptics believe the availability of similar OTC compounds will set a low ceiling on the Miraxion pricing.  Our conversations with doctors and understanding of the landscape suggest otherwise. First, Fish oil and Miraxion are simply not the same thing.  The ingredient might be synonymous but the purification process and formula used by Amarin strips away components of natural fish oil that hinder the effectiveness.  Second, HD is a life threatening disease and we’re hard pressed to believe all but a fraction of patients would risk shaving time and comfort from their lives to save a few thousand dollars per year.  If that wasn’t enough, Miraxion should receive insurance reimbursement, further lowering the actual cost to the consumer.  A private equity contact we spoke with who is in the neutraceutical business mentioned other situations where drugs have been approved with rival OTC supplement forms and have been able to receive reimbursement and pricing power of more than 10x the OTC version in non-life threatening applications – what matters is that the FDA says this is the approved formula that is produced in a controlled environment. 
  Discussion with Doctors made the case even stronger.  Virtually none of the doctors we consulted with would suggest or approve of their patients taking the OTC version if a FDA approved drug is available.  There is litigation risk, health risk from Mercury and unregulated production, and the risk of the overall benefit experienced.  It’s common to go against the “doctors orders” but not likely in this situation.    
  Although the low CAG scoring patients represent 70% of the population 30k diagnosed patients in the US, we also believe the high scoring patients are likely to take the drug, despite what could be restrictive labeling (from the focused trial population).  Again, the HD patient is in such need that they are willing to take almost anything that provides a benefit. 
    Valuation:
Given the binary risk we look at this investment using a probability tree.  It should be noted that with a small, well-informed, and close knit population of Huntington’s disease patients the marketing expense will be tiny, yielding a 75% EBIT margin.  Effectively, the Huntington’s study group and the 60 odd centers running the trial will act as a “marketing staff.”  International marketing efforts will be headed by their partners, with AMRN taking a royalty cut of 20% on EU sales and allowing Amarin mgmt. to focus on the US.  Mgmt estimates the US HD opportunity at 250-500m in sales and of similar size in EU.

  5)       Unsuccessful drug, trades to .75 cents & able to raise cash / try again / pursue other drugs
Probability:                                   40%
    All in, the probability adjusted value per share is about $18 dollars, but we believe the most likely scenario is #3, at $26 per share.  We think longer term there is a 60% chance of approval and a 40% chance of rejection. 
  Competing Drugs:
There are a number of drugs approved today as therapeutic treatments for HD, similar to Miraxion, but all of them have severe side effects and are not heavily used.  These include Haldol, Profenazine, and potentially, Tetrabenzanine, if it gets approved in the US (approved in the EU and only generates 5-10m in sales, approvable letter in the US right now).  The first two sell for extremely cheap prices, although have severe side effects sometimes much worse than HD itself, but can have potent results in those cases where the side effects do not occur.   Doctors expressed more interest in prescribing Miraxion if it is approved over these other compounds given the safety to efficacy profile. 
  Amarin has a history that has helped create the opportunity: 
Amarin is an Elan spin out from a few years back.  The history is so ugly that Amarin’s reputation has been long tarnished.  Elan sold a drug to AMRN with seller financing (getting high on your own supply) which immediately went generic.   They stuffed the channel so badly that sales went briefly negative.  Look at a 5 year chart to get a sense of what happened to the Elan stock price if you don’t remember the depth of their mis-dealings, which were not limited to Amarin.  While the ex-Elan scientists at AMRN continue to be well regarded in Ireland the top management and finance team are viewed with skepticism. All that said, investors don’t think or presume that there is any fraud here, it’s more of a show me story. 
  We have met with the CFO and CEO on numerous occasions and believe they are honest individuals with integrity.  Though we admit not even the secret service can spot a prevaricator much more than more than 50% of the time, Rick Stewart, CEO, is of the caliber you’d expect at a company 10x the size of Amarin, and our lengthy discussions with him have given us comfort with his intentions.  There is also considerable inside ownership, with nearly 1/3rd the float tied up with insiders.   The pedigree of management, however speckled by former affiliations, is top notch given the size of the company.   
  Other points of consideration:
~100 patients from the original trial are still taking Miraxion (not paying), nearly 5 years later.  We spoke to one of the doctors who has more than 5 such patients and he was enthusiastic about the benefit they’ve experienced.
  A similar EPA based drug has been sold by Mochida Pharmaceuticals in Japan for 15 years under the name Epadel for roughly $3,000 annual treatment cost.  More than two million people have taken it since launch, mostly for fatty lipid / cholesterol related artery hardening diseases.  If you assume the first 3 years were penetration growth, that leaves normalized annual sales of around 500m to 600m.  We have not been able to verify this with Mochida personally.
  Miraxion has a Special Protocol Assessment from (SPA) from the FDA.  This means that the FDA has spent considerable energy in guiding the company through the new trial design using original trial results in hopes of constructing a design that will maximize the probability of success.  We note that the odds of approval in these situations are much more likely than standard phase III trials.  In fact, Management claims that the FDA was so sure in the setup of their new trial, they actually requested some higher CAG score patients be included in the mix so that they can provide more general labeling.  The Huntington’s disease community wants this drug on the market and is pressuring the FDA to approve it.  This will have an impact on the FDA’s decision given it’s extreme safety profile.  It seems there is little holding back the FDA from approving this short of a total miss on the primary endpoint.   
  Miraxion is being pursued in other neurological disorders/diseases including a rare form of depression.  We think there is opportunity in these indications and that could help offset the binary outcome of this trial.  We personally know psychiatrists who use fish oil supplements to treat rare forms of depression that do not respond to standard treatments.  They have had periodic success. Depression is a huge market potential, but more a prop on floor value. 
  There were 6 trial centers participating in the original trial, 5 of which were independent and one which had financial interests in Miraxion.  The results for both center populations are broken out and while there are differences, there does not appear to be a pattern of biased results and we ran the statistical analysis using both sets and came up with different, yet still encouraging result.    
  Miraxion has orphan drug status and will get 7 years of exclusivity in the US – no generics in the EU for 10 years.  This is special treatment the FDA gives to companies who pursue smaller market drugs. 
  Ample cash to fund trials / development of ~ 33m.  A probable milestone payment from Valeant of up to 18m.  Chance to sell depression rights of Miraxion for around 8m upfront today with % future sales royalty.  Amarin is holding out to get better data and better terms on a deal for the depressiona application.  + other indications reprsent a nice floor value for the business if it were to quit operations and sell off the assets.   
  Even without a specific CAG group breakdown the PP group was close to statistical significance. 
       Risks:
  Every drug trial has a considerable amounts of risk.  Even the most bulletproof designs and expectations still fail to meet FDA requirements.
  Recently, mgmt has been more open in their outlook / timeline for the trials.  For conservatism sake they believe this current trial will receive an “approvable” letter.  It is our understanding that the approvable letter would only relate to drug labeling.  I.e. – Miraxion only useful in low CAG scoring patients, which would limit rapid market penetration as patients seek to determine their own CAG scores etc.  We note that this is part of the reason why the FDA has actually requested that some higher scoring CAG patients be “let into” the trial, as management has communicated to us before, so that they can avoid restrictive labeling. It seems that this will be a temporary hurdle rather than a longer term nail in the coffin and might be centered on having more safety information (most large trials have 2 or 3 efficacy studies and 1 safety study.  Amarin only has 2 efficacy studies).  It was noted that Mochida Pharmaceuticals, the markets of Epadel in Japan, have agreed to let Amarin use their 300 patient safety study of EPA in patients.  This may or may not be an acceptable medium.  In light of this, the short term voting characteristics of Mr. Market are never easy to predict and this could present volatility if not priced into the market expectations.  We are still working through the significance of this information and may or may not be making a big deal out of what is truly as conservative statement by mgmt.   
  Miraxion trials are being run in both the US and EU.  Typically, at least two different trials are needed to yield positive results against a primary endpoint in Phase III testing for the FDA to give the thumbs up.  It is easy to get comfortable with the US testing, the EU is more out of reach and presents more risk in our opinion.  However, both countries have robust requirements. If the US is positive and the EU fails, still a chance of getting approval but would likely need to run one more test either in the US or in the EU.  Likely that the co. had to run the test in the EU and US to ensure a quick patient enrollment – as the strict screening did make it more difficult to find patients for enrollment. 
  We could see another large difference between ITT and PP patients due to the difficulty of managing HD patients for such a prolonged period of time that could throw the end results.  We would expect that the patients have all been explained the importance of following procedure but self interests can always conflict.  I.e – thinking you’re on a placebo and supplementing your regimen with OTC fish oil and clouding the comparison vs. the control group.

Summary
NI Holdings (NODK) is a conservatively capitalized insurer (less than 1.0x premium to surplus ratio) with a solid underwriting track record (14-year average combined ratio of 93.6%) and unique MHC structure (holding nearly 60% of the shares) that obscures the true value of the company. I estimate the stock is conservatively worth at least $26.50/share (compared to the current price of $19.15) and perhaps much more with multiple possible catalysts on the horizon. The company has been buying back stock (856,499 shares in the last year, 9% of the non-MHC-held float) which should benefit remaining shareholders.
  The investment case for NODK is a simple one: the stock trades for about 73% of my estimate of true book value (post-conversion). In the coming years, the MHC will likely convert to full stock ownership, at which point the company should trade up to book value or higher. In time, NODK will likely be acquired at a premium . In the intervening years, the company will continue to grow equity value at a mid to high-single-digit rate while buying back stock, making acquisitions, and paying dividends with excess capital and profits. I believe a mid-teen or better return in the stock with minimal risk is reasonable at the current price.
  Average daily volume is about 13,500 shares (about $250,000 at $19/share), too thin for most large-scale institutional managers but highly liquid compared to some other stocks we own. We should be able to buy tens of thousands of shares without much trouble should we want to.
  Company Description
Nodak Insurance (a subsidiary of NODK) was founded in 1946 to offer property and casualty (P&C) insurance (mainly home and farm) to members of the North Dakota Farm Bureau Federation (NDFB). Over the decades, the company has added complementary lines of business, acquired new ones, and expanded into new states. Today, NODK is a niche insurer operating in six reportable segments: private passenger auto (25% of net premiums earned), non-standard auto (19%), home and farm (26%), crop (13%), commercial (13%), and other (3%). Below is a breakdown of net premiums earned and underwriting profits by segment in 2020:

  NODK has underwrote a profit in 13 of the last 14 years with a high combined ratio of 110.3% in 2011 (due mainly to abnormally harsh weather in the Midwest), low of 85.0% in 2015, and average of 93.6% Excludes fee income which is an important part of the non-standard auto business and has added on average about 0.7% per year to the underwriting margin.
    over the 14-year period. Such results are on par with other large, well-known P&C insurers such as Progressive (92.5% average combined ratio over the last decade), Traveler’s (94.8%), Allstate (94.2%), and Chubb (91.2%), although variability in any given year is much higher at NODK given large exposure to North Dakota weather.
  NODK writes the majority of its business in North Dakota (46% of direct premiums written in 2020), with further contribution from Illinois (14%), Nebraska (13%), South Dakota (7%), New Jersey (4%), Maryland (3%), Pennsylvania (3%), Nevada (3%), Virginia (2%), Georgia (2%), District of Columbia (1%), Minnesota (1%), North Carolina (1%), Delaware (1%), South Carolina (<1%), Arizona (<1%), and West Virginia (<1%). NODK has ~5.5% market share in North Dakota (4th largest operator in the state) and less than 1% in all other states. NODK is rated “A” by AM Best (third highest rating out of 15).
  Private Passenger Auto (PPA)
PPA insurance is written through Nodak Insurance Company (North Dakota), American West Insurance Company (South Dakota), and Battle Creek Mutual Insurance Company (Nebraska). NODK’s PPA track record is mixed.
      2020 was the best year on recent record, mainly due to reduced driving during the pandemic and the resulting decline in losses (weather was also more favorable in the Midwest in 2020, leading to fewer accidents and hail damage). The combined ratio has averaged 99.1% since 2015 (100.7% excluding the favorable result of 2020). PPA is NODK’s toughest line of business due to formidable competition from heavyweights like GEICO, Progressive, State Farm, and Allstate. NODK, through its three regional brands, attempts to attract local auto business in combination with home, farm, and crop insurance. I expect the PPA business to continue to produce slim to no underwriting profits in the future given heavy competition from larger peers.
  Non-Standard Auto (NSA)
NSA business is written through Primero Insurance Company (primarily in Nevada with small contributions from Arizona, North Dakota, and South Dakota) and Direct Auto Insurance Company (Illinois), both of which target high-risk Spanish-speaking populations. Primero was acquired by NODK in 2014 and Direct Auto in 2018. Underwriting results at Primero have been unsatisfactory, showing a loss in five of the last six years (2020 being the exception). If we add fee and other income, an important element of profitability for the non-standard auto business, Primero has had an underwriting profit in three of the last six years.
    Management attributes the poor underwriting results at Primero primarily to inadequate pricing in Nevada, where minimum coverage limits have risen and rates have lagged. Pricing improved in 2020 which, combined with less miles driven during the pandemic, resulted in an underwriting profit even though earned premiums declined 37% as fewer customers renewed their coverage.
  Direct Auto, on the other hand, has reported strong underwriting results in recent years, growing premiums at 7% per year from 2015 to 2020 (despite a 16% drawdown in 2020) while earning a profit in each year and posting an average combined ratio below 90% (before fee and other income). Such results are attributed to sound leadership, niche focus, and strong relationships with local agents.
    The NSA business competes mainly with other regional carriers in Chicago, Nevada, and Arizona. This segment tends to be less competitive than the PPA business due to the smaller presence of large players; competition comes mainly from weaker local NSA insurers. Such niche dynamics can be seen in underwriting results as NODK’s NSA combined ratio has averaged 95.9% since 2015 and 88.0% since 2018. I expect the NSA segment to continue to produce underwriting profits in the low to mid-90s percentage range (coming mainly from Direct Auto) due to the aforementioned weaker and more
fragmented competition.
    Home and Farm (H&F)
NODK writes home and farm insurance through Nodak Insurance Company (North Dakota), American West (South Dakota), and Battle Creek (Nebraska). Home and farm insurance provides coverage for damage to buildings, equipment, and other contents in the event of fire, lightning, wind, hail, and theft. It also provides coverage for liabilities arising from injury on the insured's property. The H&F business dates back to the company’s founding in 1946; it has produced lumpy but satisfactory results over time.
    The average combined ratio since 2015 is 96.5%, skewed on both ends by an especially bad 2016 (heavy hail and other inclimate weather) and good 2020 (unusually favorable weather). Nodak has a strong market position in the H&F business due to its longstanding connection with the North Dakota Farm Bureau (NDFB), which originally established Nodak in 1946 to provide P&C insurance to members. To this day, the NDFB markets Nodak as its exclusive insurer of choice to members. In exchange for this promotion/accreditation, the NDFB receives a royalty based on premium volume (amounting to about $1.4 million in 2020). All customers of Nodak Insurance are members of the NDFB.
  Nodak also has a network of exclusive agents to sell and service its policies. The situation works well for all involved, as members of the NDFB receive reasonably priced insurance, the NDFB collects a royalty for its low-effort marketing, and Nodak maintains its list of high-quality customers while keeping costs down. As such, I expect NODK’s H&F business to continue to produce attractive underwriting results on average over time.
    Competitors in the H&F business include Farmers Union Mutual, North Star Mutual, American Family, and Nationwide Mutual. While these companies may have greater resources and deeper penetration in other markets, none have the same established presence and trust in North Dakota and the closely surrounding Midwest.
  Crop
NODK provides crop hail and multi-peril crop insurance through Nodak (North Dakota), American West (South Dakota), and Battle Creek (Nebraska). “Crop hail insurance” is a private insurance product that provides protection against losses to farmers’ crops due to hail damage. “Multi-peril crop insurance”, on the other hand, is a federal program that protects against crop yield losses from all types of natural causes including drought, excessive moisture, freeze, and disease. Most crop insurance sold includes a “crop-yield” and “crop-revenue” element, protecting against both reduced land productivity (yield) and a decline in crop prices (revenue).
  In 1980, Congress expanded the federal crop insurance program to cover more crops and regions of the country, and it permitted private sector insurers to market and administer federal insurance policies in exchange for the opportunity to earn a profit while bearing a portion of the insurance risk. Congress also authorized a premium subsidy for farmers and ranchers. In combination, these actions led to rapid and widespread adoption of crop insurance (acres insured grew from 26 million in 1980 to 100 million in 1990 and 380 million in 2019).
  Federally-run multi-peril crop insurance is a complicated business. Simply stated, the price for multi-peril policies is fixed by the Risk Management Agency (a division of the USDA), and private insurance companies (like NODK) market the product, manage the policies, and share a portion of the risk/reward on a sliding scale. NODK and other private insurers who market and service the policies are reimbursed by the government for a portion of their costs (around 12-13% in NODK’s case).
  The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) provides reinsurance for the industry should extreme losses occur. NODK also maintains additional reinsurance on top of the FCIC’s. NODK’s max loss ratio on crop insurance is 105%, a level which has only been reached once since 2003 (in 2011). NODK retains weather-related losses from catastrophic events of $10 million, with reinsurance coverage in excess of retention of $117 million. Due to extensive reinsurance protection, both from the federally-supported FCIC and private third-parties, I believe catastrophic tail risk is minimal.
  The government’s expense reimbursement program combined with risk-management reinsurance support has historically made crop insurance a low risk, high return business. A change in government policy, although not predicted, could dampen the attractiveness of this segment and is a risk to consider (although a small one for NODK in my view as further explained below).
    2019 and 2020 were both higher loss years than average due mainly to a wet spring and cool summer in 2019, resulting in a delay for crops to mature, combined with a wet fall causing delayed harvest of those crops. Such developments lead to a higher than normal number of prevented planting claims in 2020 due
to fields not being harvested in 2019. These events illustrate the inherent uncertainty of North Dakota crop insurance in any given year; specific results in any year shouldn’t have a large impact on long-term value.
  Competitors in crop insurance include Chubb, QBE Insurance Group, Rural Community Insurance Services, CGB Enterprises, and Great American Insurance Group. I believe it likely NODK will continue to earn underwriting profits on its crop insurance, but the company is much less dependent on this line of business now than in the past as other segments have grown to represent larger portions of earnings. A loss of business or government support would not spell doom for NODK.
  Commercial
NODK writes commercial insurance primarily through Westminster American Insurance Company (acquired January 1, 2020) throughout the Eastern and parts of the Southeastern US. Westminster has a history of success as the company has grown earned premiums from $3.6 million in 2007 to $25.5 million in 2020 (16.2% CAGR) while achieving an average combined ratio of 82.1% over the same time frame with no loss years.
  Westminster’s growth and profitability can be attributed to its focus on commercial habitational insurance in the Northeast. Management has shown a solid aptitude for taking such risk and has built strong relationships among local agents and brokers. I expect the commercial segment to continue to grow and add profits over time as it continues to gain share in the Northeast and permeate further south.
  Other
The “all other” segment consists mainly of excess liability coverages and reinsurance assumed. This segment is small and volatile (subject to current market pricing and risk/opportunity) but has historically been highly profitable.
  Total Underwriting
Put together, NODK makes up a collection of niche underwriters that have collectively achieved solid growth and profits in the past and should continue to do so in the future. Below is the 10-year pro-forma underwriting record including all acquired lines (as if such acquirees have always been part of NODK).
    Based on historical performance, forward estimates, and current activity levels, I believe NODK’s “normalized” pre-tax underwriting earning power is around $17.5 million (94% combined ratio on about $285 million of net premiums earned).
  Investment Portfolio
NODK’s investment portfolio is nothing particularly special or interesting. The company has hired independent investment advisors Conning Inc., Disciplined Growth Investors, and CIBC Personal Wealth Management to manage conservative portfolios. While I don’t see any huge upside in the investment portfolio, I also don't see any big risks. Fixed-income securities (all of which are investment-grade) make up about 65% of the total, while cash and equivalents contribute another 20%. The remaining 15% resides in equities and other investments.
  Credit/default risk is low given concentration in high-grade bonds and cash. Interest rate risk is moderate as the average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio is 4.65 years and the average duration is 3.57 years. This is comparable to other large insurers like Progressive (duration of 2.9 years), Allstate (5.0), and Chubb (4.0). For NODK, a 1% increase in interest rates would result in an estimated reduction of $11.4 million in the fixed income portfolio. A dramatic 5% rise in interest rates would likely result in post-conversion book value declining to around $22/share from the current $26.50/share estimate. Given the shares trade at a meaningful discount to book value in all but the most extreme interest rate scenarios, I am not overly concerned with interest rate risk/sensitivity. Rising rates would of course decrease current equity value but would also result in greater investment income going forward.
  I expect the investment portfolio as it stands today to throw off about $9 million in annual pre-tax income, for a net return on average cash/investments of about 1.8% (consistent with the last few years). This could increase should rates rise and/or more of the cash be invested (pre-IPO in 2017 cash made up only 9% compared to the current 20% of invested assets).
  Competitive Positioning and Growth
NODK has three main subsidiaries (discussed above) which drive the majority of its profits: Nodak Insurance (North Dakota), Direct Auto (Illinois), and Westminster (Eastern seaboard). These three companies have carved out profitable niches that allow them to make more money than the average small
P&C insurer.
  Nodak has a 60+ year established track record in North Dakota, which comes with brand recognition, loyalty, trust, and long-standing relationships. In addition, Nodak is endorsed by the NDFB and maintains a network of exclusive agents which are paid lower commissions than their independent counterparts. For these reasons, Nodak is able to make smart, selective risks, charge fair prices, and keep costs down.
  Direct Auto has grown from a startup with $2.4 million in capital in 2007 to a legitimate insurance player in Illinois with $35.8 million in capital in 2020. They have done this by focusing almost exclusively on high-risk Hispanic drivers in the Chicago area, developing a deep understanding of the risks these policies present and prices they warrant, and building solid relationships with local independent agents. Direct Auto pays more commission to agents (nearly 25%) than their counterparts which has allowed them to be more selective in the business they take (resulting in lower than average loss rates).
  Similarly, Westminster has targeted a specialized niche--commercial habitational insurance in the Northeast (now moving south). They understand the market well, know the risks, and price accordingly. Unlike many P&C peers, they have not strayed from their competency into new, unknown business segments in an effort to grow. Moving south presents added risks but there have yet to be any signs of trouble.
  Given NODK’s comparatively small market share (< 5% in most markets outside of North Dakota) and attractive operating metrics, I believe the company will be able to grow faster than the industry in the coming years. Management is implementing multiple strategies in pursuit of this growth, including continued emphasis on Nodak’s relationship with the North Dakota Farm Bureau, using the relative cost advantage created by their low expense ratio to selectively expand share in primary markets, leverage their improved AM Best rating and larger size to grow Westminster’s commercial business, expand and enhance agency relationships in Nebraska and South Dakota, and expand the NSA business taking share from weaker fragmented competitors. This growth should be funded primarily from internally-generated operating cash flows and investment income, as well as from the proceeds from a possible (and I believe likely) second-step IPO.
    These strike me as logical growth objectives with at least reasonable odds of success. Importantly, in buying at a meaningful discount to TBV, we are not dependent on strong future growth for our return, although such a result would be an added delight. A doubling of equity in the next decade (conservative) combined with a doubling of the P/B multiple (also reasonable) would result in a four-bagger (15% CAGR).
  Insiders
NODK is led by CEO Jim Alexander, an insurance veteran who has been with the company since 2003. Over his tenure, NODK has produced profits in all but two years and has grown equity from $60.8 million in 2007 to $344.3 million in 2020 (including the first-step IPO in 2017 which raised about $90 million). I have spoken on the phone with Jim three times and I find him to be sincere, honest, and helpful. Jim is 54-years-old, owns 78,802 shares ($1.5 million at $19/share), and earns a salary of $800,000 (total comp in 2020 was $2.7 million including bonuses).
    Executives earn short-term bonuses (paid in cash) which are based on four factors: statutory surplus growth (3% minimum for any bonuses to be paid), combined ratio, direct premiums, and ROE. The company targets a 94% combined ratio, 4% growth in direct premiums written, and 10% pre-tax return on equity, with different bonus payouts above and below these targets. The long-term incentive is based solely on 3-year BVPS growth and is paid in the form of stock. The company targets a 7% BVPS CAGR.
  I find these incentives to be reasonable but not perfect (growth in premiums should be based on capital availability and attractiveness of pricing, not some arbitrary “goal”), and I think they are a bit conservative. Historically, NODK has outperformed all of these hurdles. In my conversations with Jim I believe he is focused on safely growing NODK without sacrificing strength or profitability to meet short-term financial goals. For example, NODK could easily write more premiums and achieve faster growth given their conservative level of capital, but Jim refuses to do so as it would hurt the combined ratio, ROE, AM Best rating, and ultimately result in loss of shareholder’s capital.
    Eric Aasmunstad is the Chairman of the board and has been a director of Nodak since 1997. He owns 17,814 shares ($338,466 at $19/share). A product of North Dakota, Eric graduated from North Dakota State University. He farms approximately 4,000 acres, owns a metalworking company, and operated a custom harvesting business until 2012. In addition, Eric was President of the North Dakota Farm Bureau from 1999 to 2011.
  Six board members were paid an average of $69,333 in cash and $55,692 in stock each in 2020 for total director compensation of $750,150. This isn’t the cheapest board nor the most egregious. Of course, I’d rather they be paid little to nothing. In the case of NODK, the board does have the important responsibility of risk oversight and capital allocation, crucial to an insurer with excess capital. Board members and executives are all required to own no less than two times their base salary in NODK common stock in an effort to align their own interests with those of shareholders. This can be achieved through the awarding of stock units or open market purchases. Five years are given for insiders to meet this ownership minimum. As NODK went public in 2017, all executives and directors must meet the requirement beginning in 2022.
    The largest shareholder (outside the MHC) is Jeff Thorp (son of Ed Thorp) who holds 1,110,263 shares ($21.1 million at $19/share), representing 5.2% of the total shares outstanding and 12.8% of the non-MHC-held float. Jim tells me there are a few small institutions who hold shares, but none in large amounts (post-second-step IPO, I imagine there may be more institutional buyers which could serve as a catalyst to push the price up). Other notable shareholders include the firms of Michael Price and Joseph Stilwell, both adept fundamental value investors.
    Overall, I believe management is competent and conservative, as evidenced by the solid operating track record and strong balance sheet, and the shareholder base includes a handful of intelligent, value-focused owners (which management trusts and listens to) of which we may become another. I see no big red flags from insiders.
    Valuation
There are multiple ways to value a partially-public mutual insurance company. My method of choice is to value the stock as if the conversation were to take place at the current price under reasonable assumptions, illustrated as follows:
  Current equity (as of 12/31/20)
$344.3 million
Offering price
$19.15/share
Leakage
10%
Capital raised
$218 million
Shares
21.3 million
BVPS
$26.38
Current multiple
0.7x
Conservative multiple
1.1x
Fair value
$29/share
Current price
$19.15/share
Discount
34%
  We can also measure value by examining the normalized earning power of the company. Net earned premiums are around $290 million. A normalized combined ratio of 94% results in underwriting profit of $17.6 million. On the investment side, NODK has cash and invested assets of $494 million which should generate an additional $9 million of income (1.8% net return). This gives us total pre-tax profit of about $26.5 million. With the current 22% tax rate, we get net earning power of $20.7 million. If we assume the additional capital from the second-step (about $218 million ) returns a modest 8% (around $17.4 million), we get total income of about $38 million. This is a 9.3% earnings yield based on the current market capitalization of $408 million (10.7x P/E ratio). I believe this initial yield, coupled with modest growth and multiple expansion, is likely to produce teens or better returns going forward.
  Finally, I present a high-level view of a boring but plausible scenario. Let’s say in the next decade NODK doubles shareholder’s equity (an undemanding 7% per year). Over this period, the company completes its second step IPO, gains the attention of institutional managers, and earns a valuation more in line with
peers and recent transaction multiples of around 1.4x book (to be further discussed below). In such a case, the stock would be worth about $73/share, 281% above its current price. Indeed, a doubling of equity and a doubling of the multiple paid for that equity results in a four-bagger which, over the course of a decade,
equates to a 15% CAGR. Of course this analysis is far from perfect, but I think it is reasonable and perhaps conservative, as timing could be faster (resulting in a higher CAGR) or equity growth could be stronger (7% is a low bar).
  All of this is to say that I believe NODK is worth at least book value and possibly significantly more. Comparative figures for larger peers support this view:
  NODK is under-levered compared to most P&C insurers. Increasing underwriting leverage (by either writing more premiums or reducing equity), would boost the ROE to a double-digit percentage, supporting my belief that NODK is worth at least book value and likely more. As can be seen above, NODK trades at a significant discount compared to other well-known peers despite similar operating metrics and arguably better growth prospects given their smaller market share.
  In addition, a profitable, growing, overcapitalized insurer is likely worth a significant premium to a handful of would-be acquirers. Recent acquisition multiples for small P&C insurers have been considerably above book value, averaging around 1.4x and going as high as 3x+.
  That said, I don’t believe we are dependent on a sale of the business to realize investment gains in NODK. The company will continue to build equity and value. I think long-term holders will do well buying at the current price. The sale of the company at a full multiple would simply be an added cherry on top.
  Risks
● Limited track record for acquired businesses: NODK has made two sizable acquisitions (Direct auto in 2018 and Westminster in 2020) since its IPO in an effort to diversify its business and reduce exposure to the unpredictable and volatile North Dakota climate. These acquisitions have only recently been consolidated in NODK’s financials, and there is a chance that their recent strong performance proves the exception rather than the rule. I have reviewed statutory filings for both companies prior to their acquisition and both have had strong underwriting results for more than a decade. In addition, management of these companies has remained in-place post-acquisition, so I have little reason to believe the happy results won’t continue.
● Poor future acquisitions: Direct Auto and Westminster both appear to be reasonable purchases by NODK. Both companies have sound operating histories; DA was purchased at a discount to book value (what looks like a great deal based on DA’s underwriting record) while Westminster was purchased around an 80% premium to book (perhaps expensive but hard to say). Management would like to make additional acquisitions and further diversify the business. Despite a track record of reasonable deals, there is always the chance they do something dumb.
● Over-conservatism reduces returns: CEO Jim Alexander says he is comfortable operating NODK around 1.0x premiums to surplus. In 2020 the figure was 0.87x (indicating there is still some excess capital in the holding company). I think NODK could realistically go up to 1.5x without losing sleep at night. Such leverage would increase ROE from high-single-digits to low-teens. It is unlikely Jim runs the company at this level and therefore ROE will likely remain at or below 10% on average over time.
● Time to second step conversion: NODK is likely to experience a quick rise in price on announcement of a second-step conversion. I believe such an event will occur sooner rather than later (in the next couple of years) because management has stated their desire to make further acquisitions and will need additional capital to do so in the not-too-distant future, and there is a group of value-conscious shareholders known for playing the conversion game who are sure to provide pressure. However, there is always a chance management chooses to kick the can down the road, and the longer it takes for a second-step the less our rate of return will be. This risk is somewhat mitigated as NODK continues to buy back its own shares which will ultimately result in better value for remaining holders when the second-step does occur.
● Increases in interest rates: As previously discussed, a rise in rates will have a material impact on the value of NODK’s fixed income portfolio which will reduce equity value and therefore fair value of the stock. Conversely, a rise in rates will also result in higher future earnings from the investment portfolio. 
● Reputation risk, especially non-standard and social inflation: Non-standard auto insurance is notorious for terrible reviews and NODK is not immune. Direct Auto has a 1.2 star rating on Google with 300+ scathing reviews. These angry customers claim fraud and demand justice. I spoke with Jim about this and he attributes these comments to the nature of the high-risk auto insurance market and the need for Direct Auto and others to “play hardball” in certain cases given the pervasiveness of customer fraud (people keying their own cars in Chicago or burning their vehicles in Las Vegas). He says they are working to improve customer relations but the NSA business will likely never have the same goodwill as Nodak, American West, or Battle Creek. Jim assures me all insurance subsidiaries have regular inspection by governing bodies and NODK faces no threat to its operational integrity in any segment. In any line of insurance, there is risk of “social inflation” where courts give increasing power to the consumer in insurance cases.
● Discontinued government support of crop insurance: Without premium subsidies, it is likely less acreage would be insured resulting in a decline of business for NODK. In addition, without FCIC reinsurance and government-supplied expense reimbursement, NODK would have to rely solely on third-party reinsurance and fund all costs itself, which would reduce the attractiveness of the crop segment and may make it undesirable to continue. Government policy predictions are difficult to make, but there is a multi-decade track record of federal support for crop insurance. If for some reason this support should decline (I don’t think it likely), NODK now has many other lines of business in which it can focus its capital.
  I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise do not hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

A.  Introduction:

Northgate (LON:NTG, FYE to 31-April) is the leading provider of rental light commercial vehicles (LCV) to businesses in the UK and Spain, operating a fleet of ~90,000 vehicles that provides commercial customers with the flexibility to lease LCVs as and when suits their business needs. In FY 2012A Northgate generated £707m of revenue (65% in the UK, 35% in Spain), EBITA of £100m and net income of £54m. 

Northgate dominates the two markets it operates in – the UK and Spain - with a UK fleet that is 16% of the total UK LCV rental market, 2.4x larger than the next largest competitor and larger than the fleets of the no. 2, no. 3 and no. 4 competitors combined. 

What’s more, over the past two years Northgate has shown improving operating efficiency, an increasingly healthy balance sheet and a management team that’s firmly focused on efficiently allocating capital.

In 2013E and 2014E, respectively, it is expected to generate £669m and £663m of revenue; £292m and £296m of EBITDA; £107m and £112m of EBITA; £67m and £76m of net income; and £139m and £100m of equity FCF. 

It is trading at 1.1x EV / 2014E revenue; 2.5x EV / 2014E EBITDA; 6.6x EV / 2014E EBITA; 6.0x 2013 P/E; and 4.0x 2013E equity FCF. 

A range of conservative valuation estimates imply 40% to 80% upside to the current share price with limited downside risk. Furthermore, though the chance of the European macroeconomic climate improving in the next 18 months is slim, this sort of scenario presents upside optionality and scope for considerable share price appreciation from current levels (~200% vs. today’s share price). 

At 4.0x 2013E equity FCF, the current share price is an attractive entry point at which to establish a position, especially considering Northgate’s potential for substantial FCF generation (even in a no-top line growth scenario the company can provide a 20%+ FCF yield to investors whilst waiting for revenue growth to rebound). Northgate is also trading at an unduly low 2.5x 2014E EBITDA and 6.6x 2014E EBITA - below its previous cyclical low multiples - even though it now has higher operating margins and a much-improved balance sheet. 

Combine Northgate’s discount to fair value with a number of potential catalysts for share price rerating over the next 18 months and you have an extremely attractive risk-adjusted investment opportunity that offers a solid margin of safety and potential to compound healthy returns over the mid- to long-term.

B.  Why is Northgate so cheap / why does this opportunity exist?

Northgate has had a difficult few years, massively underperforming the FTSE-250 (UK mid cap.) index since 2008. Though the company’s underlying business model was sound, organic growth and acquisitions left the business overly indebted in the lead up to the financial crisis, necessitating a £108m rights issue in 2009 and the downsizing of its fleet from ~130,000 vehicles in 2008 to ~90,000 today.  This precipitated a massive share price decline (down 90% from 2007 highs). 

The collapse in the share price tramautised many investors and analysts, with many still shunning Northgate as they (incorrectly) still see it as a geared play on the unhealthy Spanish and UK economies. As one sell-side analyst puts it, “An operationally and financially leveraged group with 40% of its assets in Spain is unlikely to feature at the top of an investor's buy list.”

Whilst the market is focused on Northgate’s legacy problems and has penalised it with an unduly cheap valuation vs. peers, Northgate and its management team have restored the company’s balance sheet health, expanded margins and implemented growth initiatives to greatly improve Northgate’s earnings potential.

C.  Business overview:

Market leading position - Northgate is the largest provider of rental LCVs in the UK by a huge distance, with 2.4x the market share of the next largest competitor, Avis. It has the same share as the no. 2 to no. 5 operators combined.  Northgate is also the market leader in Spain, though its Spanish fleet shrunk from ~62,000 in 2008 to ~40,000 in 2012 (a decrease in line with competitors). 

Consistent position over time as the UK market leader by a sizeable margin – Since 2006 Northgate has had at minimum 16% absolute market share. Over the same period the company has never had less than 2.4x the market share of the next largest operator and 1.1x the share of the no. 2 to no. 4 operators combined.  Northgate’s remarkably consistent position over the years as the no. 1 operator – on absolute and relative terms - indicates it benefits from a degree of competitive advantage. Not only can it spread its fixed cost base over a wider number of LCVs than competitors – reducing cost per unit – but it also benefits from a better purchasing and vehicle disposal dynamic than peers (explained below).

Leaseway, previously Northgate’s biggest UK competitor, went into administration in January 2011 and its vehicles were sold off.  Similarly, TLS’s fleet (owned by GE) was sold off in 2011 and the business wound down by GE. Both defunct competitors were known for aggressively undercutting other operators on price. The removal of both from the market will be beneficial for Northgate.  

Scope for long-term fleet size growth – Only 11% of the 3.5m LCVs in operation in the UK are rented, though it has been steadily increasing. This is extremely low compared to other markets, such as the US, where ~33% of LCVs are leased. Yet – as per research from the UK government (Department for Transport) and Datamonitor - there are no major structural reasons why the UK penetration should be lower than other markets.

Rentals have been an increasingly large part of the total LCV market over the last 15 years (eg. growing to 11% from 7% in 1999). Management and industry observers expect UK rental penetration to continue to trend upwards meaningfully in the mid-term.  As the market leader, Northgate is well positioned to benefit. 

Northgate will also benefit from increasing numbers of corporate customers who previously purchased their own LCVs and, having survived the challenges of the recent financial crisis, are now looking to manage their balance sheets more effectively and rent vehicles instead of buying them directly.

Easy to understand business model with clear sources of value creation – Three main levers drive value creation at Northgate. Firstly, vehicle purchasing, where Northgate is one of the largest buyers of LCVs in the UK and Spain. Secondly, vehicle leasing and fleet management, where Northgate rents these vehicles to a wide range of corporate customers (with long contract lengths, averaging 3-4 months). Lastly, vehicle disposal. After 18 to 36 months of usage, Northgate sells the used LCVs via auction or, increasingly, directly to purchasers through its Van Monster subsidiary. 

Considerable buying power – Northgate is one of the largest purchasers of LCVs in the UK and Spain (~28,000 purchased in FY 2012). It purchases its LCVs from four main automotive manufacturers and is the largest rental customer of each. Not being tied to one manufacturer and purchasing in such large volumes allows Northgate to continually negotiate best-in-sector purchase prices, which its smaller competitors cannot match.

Improving sales channels – Northgate is building out a number of initiatives which will improve vehicle sales proceeds. Previously, Northgate and other competitors sold all their used LCVs via trade auctions, paying away a large sellers’ fee. Over the last 18 months, Northgate has been expanding Van Monster, its retail sales network (currently with eight sites in the UK and five in Spain), which is expected to lead to higher sale proceeds per vehicle than the traditional auction route. 

Furthermore, a consequence of Leaseway and TLS’ administrators liquidating their fleets was a large overhang of vehicles (16,000+) pouring into the used LCV market throughout 2H CY2011 and CY2012, depressing the prices that Northgate and others achieved from LCV sales. Primary research with LCV dealers and academics has shown that this overhang has now been worked down, with positive implications for the price Northgate will be able to achieve from its UK vehicles sales (19% of FY 2012A total revenue).

Improving operational efficiency and returns on invested capital – having overhauled its IT and ERP systems over the past 18 months, Northgate has identified a number of actionable opportunities to improve operating efficiency. 

Working capital management has continued to improve, with average days of net working capital having steadily decreased from an average of 80 in the 2005 to 2009A period to 35 in 2012A. Similarly, EBITA margins have rebounded from a low in 2009A of 9% to 15% in 2012A. This is still far below the 20% margins pre-crisis and suggests considerable scope for further margin expansion. 

Management has a laser-like focus on ROCE and has continued to improve returns since the low in 2009, improving to 13.1% in 2012A vs. 11.9% in 2011A. Management’s remuneration is driven by achieving ROCE and EPS stretch targets, ensuring that their economic interests are firmly aligned with shareholders’. 

Selectively pursuing growth opportunities – Northgate currently has ~60 sites in the UK from which it rents out vehicles. IT and ERP improvements have identified high-value areas in the more affluent parts of the UK that are ripe for penetration, with Northgate aiming to expand its site portfolio in the UK to 80 to 90 locations over the next few years. Four new sites are being trialled in 2H 2013E and could each deliver an incremental £1.5m in EBITA, meaning that 80 to 90 locations could generate a substantial increase of £30m to £40m of EBITA per annum (a meaningful amount vs. £100m group EBITA in 2012A).

D.  Risks, mitigants and key considerations

Spain remains a challenging operating environment – ROCE has fallen to 8.5% in Spain (prompting fleet contraction), with the business challenged to raise ROCE to 11% within the next year and managements’ incentives aligned to that goal. Management have started to improve per vehicle profitability by re-basing prices, continuing to diversify the customer base away from the construction sector, expanding the Van Monster sales channel (improving vehicle sales revenue) and driving incremental revenue opportunities. 

Whilst long-term macroeconomic conditions remain challenging and unpredictable, management look to have sound control over the business’ operational and strategic direction in the short- to mid-term. 

Fleet utilisation and fleet growth is the biggest driver of value creation – management’s focus on maximising ROCE means that Northgate has consistently targeted a 90% utilisation rate for its fleet (meaning 90% of vehicles are being rented by customers at any one time).  Even during the depths of the 2007-8 financial crisis Northgate’s utilisation rate only dropped to 83%, demonstrating the flexibility of Northgate’s business model to scale up or down as demand dictates.

Subdued customer demand since 2009 due to economic weakness has meant that management has steadily reduced the fleet size from ~130,000 in 2007/8 to ~90,000 in 2012, maintaining utilisation rates but lowering top-line revenue from £752m in 2009 to £707m in 2012A. 

Though this negative top-line impact has been partially offset at the bottom-line by operational improvements, a major upswing in long-term earnings growth will be primarily driven by fleet expansion. Positively for investors, Northgate’s business model means it’s well-equipped to quickly scale up as customer demand increases. 

The key questions that will determine value creation are (a) when will customer demand pick up, and (b) when is the optimum time to invest to capitalise on this trend. 

In the interest of prudence and in line with H1 2013E trends, we forecast no growth to fleet size or the top-line for the next few years. The rest of this investment write-up will argue that now is the ideal time to invest in Northgate and benefit from the market’s myopia around Northgate’s short-term challenges. Even with the conservative assumptions mentioned above the business’ current valuation is extremely compelling.

E.  Valuation

Northgate provides an attractive investment opportunity across a number of possible future scenarios (from (a) positive top-line growth and fleet expansion, should demand in Northgate’s markets improve, through to (b) the more likely continuation in the near-term of the company’s gentle decline in top-line revenue and vehicle numbers). 

Even with conservative 2013E and 2014E estimates for vehicle numbers and top-line growth, Northgate offers 40% to 80% potential upside to its current share price. Furthermore, though the chance of the macroeconomic climate in the UK or Spain improving meaningfully in the next 18 months is limited, this sort of scenario presents considerable upside optionality for share price appreciation from current levels (~200% vs. today’s share price). 

Cheap on a free cash flow basis - Northgate generates considerable free cash flow and yet only trades at a 4.0x 2013E equity FCF multiple. Not only does Northgate generate considerable FCF but it deploys it intelligently, too. 

First, Northgate has been prudently reducing its previously high leverage (from 2.8x LTM EBITDA in 2008A to 1.1x in 2013E), successfully addressing concerns about solvency and debt covenants. 

Second, as a result of management’s laser-like focus on return on capital, Northgate has been selectively investing in non-LCV capital expenditure only where it will drive long-term opex improvements. Given that the majority of Northgate’s capex spend is on new LCVs, management have demonstrated good judgement by targeting a fleet utilisation rate of 90% and only expanding the number of vehicles in Northgate’s fleet as customer demand dictates. If / when opportunities for fleet growth arise, Northgate is well positioned to scale up vehicle numbers (and the converse is true in a recessionary scenario). 

Finally, the company reinstated a dividend in 2012, reinforcing management’s strategy of only investing cash where returns will be clearly in excess of Northgate’s cost of capital, otherwise choosing to return funds to shareholders. If market conditions remain soft and management remain disciplined about fleet expansion, as expected, there will be considerable scope for further dividend increases and/or buybacks.

Northgate generated free cash flow of £293m, £132m and £189m and equity free cash flow of £246m, £79m and £139m in FY 2010A, 2011A and 2012A. This represented an equity FCF yield in those yields of 61%, 20% and 34%, respectively. Even with conservative forward assumptions, Northgate should generate 25% and 22% equity FCF in 2013E and 2014E, respectively. 

Northgate re-rating to 6-7x 2013E equity FCF - which is a more fair but still unchallenging multiple, given the company’s low-to-mid teens ROCE, mid-term growth potential and 20%+ estimated FCF yield - would lead to ~50 to 70% upside to the current share price. 

Attractive FCF generation potential, even if revenue doesn’t grow in the short-term - given the continued uncertainty surrounding the UK and Spanish economies, it’s hard to accurately forecast how Northgate’s fleet size will change over the next 18 months. What is important is that Northgate’s investors should profit in an expansionary scenario as well as one where the current depressed investment and growth profile continues. 

In the interest of prudence and in line with H1 2013E trends, we’ve forecast no growth to fleet size or the top-line for the next few years. 

Even on this conservative basis Northgate’s current valuation is extremely compelling. If demand in Northgate’s markets remain muted during CY 2013 and 2014 and, therefore, Northgate keeps its fleet size and capex at subdued levels, the company is fully capable of generating 20%+ equity FCF yield. Given management’s focus on ROCE and efficient capital allocation, there is a strong likelihood that some of this cash would be returned to shareholders. 

Trading below its previous cyclical low EBITDA / EBITA multiples - Northgate historically traded at between 3.0 and 5.0x NTM EBITDA through the last cycle (2001 to 2008), yet it’s currently trading at 2.5x 2014E EBITDA / 6.6x 2014E EBITA. 

What’s particularly striking is that Northgate’s business is in better shape than it was in in this part of the previous cycle. Improved operating efficiency, better working capital management, a much healthier balance sheet, more diversified customer base, competitors having exited the market and sound growth opportunities, etc, etc, etc… 

… which means that Northgate’s current trading multiple is even more unwarranted than an initial comparison to the previous cycle’s multiples suggests. There is considerable potential upside if Northgate re-rated to the previous cycle’s multiples (based on 2014E EBITDA of £296m and estimated net debt of £334m at FYE 2013E): if Northgate re-rates to a 3.0x EV / 2014E EBITDA multiple is 44%; 3.5x is 81%; 4.0x (previous mid-cycle multiple) is 117%; 4.5x is 154%; and 5.0x (previous top-of-cycle multiple) is 190%. 

Even after factoring in the subdued outlook for the UK and Spanish economies, a justifiable yet conservative NTM EBITDA multiple for Northgate is 3.0x to 3.5x, implying ~40 to 80% upside from the current share price. Similarly, a fair 2014E EBITA multiple would be ~9.0x, implying ~70% upside to the current share price.  

Cheap vs. comparable peers – Northgate’s publicly listed peers (Ashtead, Lavendon and Speedy Hire) have re-rated by 1.5x turns of EBITDA (multiple expansion of 39%) in the past nine months, off the back of improving Eurozone economic sentiment. Yet Northgate’s multiple has increased by only 0.3x turns (12% multiple expansion). 

The absence of fundamental reasons for this disparity is further support for a positive re-rating of Northgate’s share price; any number of catalysts over the next twelve months (discussed below) should prompt investor sentiment towards Northgate to improve and lead to a corresponding re-rating towards fair value.

Attractive on a private-owner valuation basis – LBO analysis of Northgate suggests it’s a very compelling target for a buyout - either by a strategic or a financial sponsor - with potential to deliver 27-35% IRRs for a sponsor (assuming an exit at 3.0 to 4.0x LTM EBITDA, in line with historic low- to mid-cycle multiples). 

This is based on conservative operating estimates (2% revenue CAGR to 2019; EBITDA margin of 47%; capex intensity of 24% of revenue; and acquiring Northgate at the beginning of FY2014E and exiting at FYE 2017E) and similarly conservative financing estimates (50% premium paid to current share price; 40% equity / 60% debt capital structure, which implies leverage of 1.9x EBITDA; and an interest rate at 6%). By 2018, the business will have generated enough FCF to pay down all the debt and be net cash. 

Attractive asymmetric upside/downside risk profile - One of the most attractive aspects of an investment in Northgate is that it combines a margin of safety on the downside (significant discount to intrinsic value; easy-to-understand, market-leading business model; historic and current ROIC greater than the cost of capital; and considerable FCF generation potential in a no growth scenario) with a lot of upside potential that an investor isn’t paying for. 

The impact on EBITA if the fleet expanded in the future is considerable; 100,000 vehicles is a realistic target if demand in Northgate’s markets improve and is well below the 130,000 peak achieved in 2007/8. An increase in the fleet size from the current ~87,000 to 95,000 would deliver a 10% EBITA increase; 100,000 delivers a 17% increase; 105,000 delivers a 24% increase; and returning to the previous peak fleet size of 130,000 would deliver a 59% EBITA increase. 

Though the economic climate in the UK or Spain is unlikely to improve meaningfully in the next 18 months, there is considerable upside optionality in Northgate’s current share price should customer demand improve more quickly than the market expects. 

If Northgate’s fleet grew to 100,000 LCVs, its EBITDA margin expanded to pre-crisis levels of ~50-52% and it re-rated to a 4x EBITDA multiple (in line with previous mid-cycle multiples) the company’s share price would be ~200 to 220% above today’s price. None of these assumptions is unrealistic in a more positive macroeconomic environment, especially if looking further out to FY 2014/15E.

F.  Catalysts for share price appreciation:

Improving leverage profile - Northgate went into the financial crisis highly geared, with 2.8x net debt / LTM EBITDA. When profits in 2009 declined, a great deal of investors’ and analysts’ attention between 2009 and 2012 focused on whether Northgate would be able to stay within its debt covenants. 

Having successfully navigated this risk (Northgate now has comfortable headroom within its covenants), the company has begun to demonstrate strong FCF generation (consistently converting 150%+ of net income into equity FCF over 2008-12A). This has prompted analysts and investors’ focus to shift away from balance sheet risk to upside earnings potential, which will have positive implications for share price momentum. 

Net debt / LTM EBITDA has steadily from ~2.7x between 2006A and 2009A to 1.4x in 2012A. Even with conservative future forecasts for revenue growth, operating margins and capex intensity, Northgate's high FCF generation means that can de-lever to 1.1x in 2013E, 0.9x in 2014E and 0.5x in 2015E. 

Northgate now has a much stronger balance sheet and – as it continues to generate substantial FCF – can begin to shift focus from paying down debt towards returning funds to shareholders (eg. the company re-initiated its dividend in late CY 2012) and/orinvesting capex in fleet growth.

Reducing financing costs - interest expense, at £46m in 2012A, absorbs a meaningful 40% of EBITA. Refinancing the current debt structure could be costly in the short term (c. £15m to £20m) but would payback in less than two years by reducing annual cash interest payments by c. £12m (improving PBT considerably, by 15 to 20% per year). 

Management stated in 2012 that it is actively exploring the opportunity to simplify Northgate’s debt structure and reduce its blended interest rate (relatively high, at 7%). Any announcement of a refinancing (perhaps at FYE this April) would likely be a major boost to profits in the mid-term and a clear catalyst for share price appreciation.

Attractive takeover candidate - In October 2012, Northgate was reportedly the target of a 400p offer from Avis (a 28% premium to the then current share price) but the offer was purportedly rejected by Northgate management as being too low. Northgate has also previously been a target for numerous financial sponsors, including Terra Firma, who had a 1,200p bid rejected in 2006. 

It’s not far-fetched to envision an offer midway between the current share price of 305p and the top end of intrinsic value of 500p to 600p, which would (a) be actively considered by Northgate management, (b) create considerable value for an acquirer (even without factoring in synergies in the case of a strategic buyer), and (c) deliver considerable upside from the current price for investors. 

The private valuation analysis in the previous section shows that a financial sponsor could bid 520p (~70% premium to today’s price) and still expect an IRR between 28% and 33% (assuming the same conservative operating and financial estimates as noted in the previous section and the sponsor exiting at 3.0 to 4.0x LTM EBITDA, in line with historic mid-cycle multiples). 

The point of this analysis is not to suggest that a bid is likely at a specific price but to reiterate that Northgate has (a) been the target of interest for a number of potential acquirers historically and (b) its current valuation means an acquirer could justify a substantial premium to the current share price and still create significant value. The potential for a bid for the company in the next 12 to 18 months should not be discounted. 


****

G.  Conclusion

Northgate is an extremely compelling investment opportunity for both the short and longer term:

Well-managed and easy-to-understand business model - supported by secular tailwinds, market-leading position and ongoing operational improvements that will drive free cash flow and earnings growth in the mid-term

Trading at considerably discount to intrinsic value – due to market misperceptions that will likely correct over the next 12 to 18 months, offering 40% to 80% potential upside from the current share price 

Clear potential catalysts for share price rerating – numerous catalysts that could prompt the rerating towards intrinsic value

Margin of safety – All of the above combines to offer an attractive asymmetric risk / reward profile, with limited downside and numerous possible drivers of meaningful earnings growth on the upside

Catalyst

Summary: Catalysts for share price appreciation:

(1). Major deleveraging will shift analyst / investor attention away from the possibility of breaching debt covenants (no longer an issue) towards the company's considerable FCF and earnings generation potential
(2). Interest expense is high and a refinancing of the existing debt would unlock considerable value for shareholders, with management having stated that it is actively evaluating this course of action
(3). Attractive take over candidate - Northgate has been the subject of bids from strategics and sponsors in the recent past and LBO analysis suggests major scope for value creation for a sponsor, even after paying a large price premium

Thesis
AMC Networks is a highly-levered, fast-growing group of cable networks that is underfollowed by the sell-side as a result of its spin-off from parent Cablevision (CVC). Its networks are enjoying significant ratings and advertising momentum, and its value will be further enhanced by its >5x leverage profile and significant FCF visibility – resulting in rapid de-leveraging. Additionally, there is margin expansion potential at International turns the corner, optionality on a VOOM/DISH resolution, additional monetization opportunities on its original programming, and – ultimately – AMC Networks is a very attractive asset for a strategic acquirer to own.
  Investment Highlights
Improving Ratings. In recent years, AMC has switched focus from ‘movie classics’ to high-quality, highly-rated original programming such as Mad Men, Breaking Bad, Walking Dead and The Killing – with a fifth series expected in Q4 2011 (Hell on Wheels). Higher ratings equal higher advertising rates, and greater leverage during affiliate agreement negotiations
Affiliate Fee Increases. Continued ratings strength at AMC and further build-out of original programming at WEtv, IFC and Sundance should lead to potentially significant affiliate fee increases in 2013 and beyond. AMC has ~89% of its subs under affiliation agreements through 2012, while WEtv (74%), IFC (81%) and Sundance (67%) also face significant affiliate renewals beginning in 2013
High FCF Visibility/High Leverage. Given its low capital intensity, AMCX has significant FCF conversion – enabling it to pay down debt aggressively. AMCX has ~$260mm in NOLs that will likely be utilized over the next twelve months
Potential Strategic Acquisition. Given its prospects and relatively small bite-size (sub-$3B market cap), I fully expect AMCX to be acquired once its two-year ‘safe-harbor blackout’ is lifted, though any would-be acquirer would likely have to pay premium ahead of the expected affiliate fee increases in 2013 and beyond
  Description
AMC Networks owns and operates several cable networks: AMC, IFC, WEtv, Wedding Central and the Sundance Channel, as well as IFC Entertainment, an ‘indie’ film distributor.
AMC is a provider of dramatic television series and films, as well as a library of popular and classic films; television series include: Mad Men, Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead and The Killing
IFC airs independent films and documentaries as well as original programming, including Portlandia and The Onion News Network
WEtv focuses on original content for women, including series such as Bridezillas and Downsized, as well as re-airing classic series including The Golden Girls and Charmed
Sundance Channel airs independent films and programs highlighting design, travel, and fashion
Outside of the national networks, AMCX generates revenue from AMC/Sundance Channel Global – airing its networks to ~8mm subs in eight countries including Canada;  IFC Entertainment distributes indie films to theaters and VOD services, and operates the IFC Center movie theater in NYC
Post-spin, Josh Sapan will remain CEO of AMC Networks, and Charles Dolan will be Executive Chairman
Both CVC and AMCX will continue to be controlled by the Dolan family – 100% of Class B shares and 3.9% of Class A share, or ~71% voting power and ~22% equity ownership
  History
In 1980, Cablevision formed Rainbow Media Holdings (now AMC Networks) to create niche programming for the nascent cable TV market.
Through the creation of Bravo and American Movie Classics (now AMC), it focused on original/film programming
AMC Networks created The Independent Film Channel (now IFC) and WEtv (launched as Romance Classics in 1997), and acquired the Sundance Channel in 2008
AMC Networks sold Bravo – the 1st network dedicated to film/performing arts – to NBC Universal in 2002 for $1.25B
  Business Model
AMCX has two primary sources of revenues (affiliate revenues & ad sales) and two forms of content (original programming & acquired programming)
Affiliation agreements are set on a per-sub basis under multiyear contracts
Advertising sales are typically short-term and based on the ratings/popularity of the programming
In 2010, national networks revs increased ~11% ($98mm) to $995mm driven by increased advertising (~$56mm) and affiliate fee expansion (~$32mm); national networks accounted for ~92% of total revs in 2010
AMCX derived ~57% of revs from affiliate fees  and  ~37% from ad sales
DISCA generates ~48% of revs from affiliate fees and ~44% from ad sales; 63% US revs / ~33% int’l
SNI derives ~27% from affiliate fees  and ~63% of its revs from ad sales; ~100% US revs
  Outlook
Opportunities for revenue growth boil down to distribution expansion and increased programming popularity
AMC – the oldest and most widely distributed network – has likely hit a saturation point with annual sub growth at less than 1.5% in each of the last 3 years – in other words, most cable/satellite customers have AMC available
Popularity/buzz around AMC’s original programming may offset the subscriber growth slowdown with higher per sub affiliation agreements and higher ad rates
In 2010, AMC was 14th among basic cable network for audience gains (Nielsen) – higher audience numbers result in stronger ad revenues
Sundance – AMC’s smallest national network – is growing at the fastest rate: over 23% in 2009 to ~38mm subs and over 5% in 2010 to ~40mm subs, though still less than half of AMC as a result of its typical positioning on ‘premium’ cable tiers
  Ratings Momentum
AMC Networks grew total viewers 18%, led by AMC (+29%) on the strength of new series The Killing and The Walking Dead.
The Killing season finale delivered 2.3mm total viewers for a 1.8 household rating and ~1.1mm adults aged 25-54. The Killing premiered on April 3rd to 2.7mm total viewers, and had the 2nd highest-rated first season of any AMC original drama (next to The Walking Dead); The Killing has been renewed for another season
The Walking Dead premiered on Halloween 2010, and ranked as the 5th most watched basic cable primetime original series in 2010. Over 6.6mm households and 4.5mm viewers aged 18-49 tuned in, leading to significant audience gains for AMC last year

On July 1st, 2011 Cablevision (CVC) will complete the tax-free 100% spin-off of AMC Networks (AMCX).
CVC shareholders will receive 0.25 AMCX shares for each share of CVC held
CVC will become a nearly pure-play cable company – and should narrow the valuation discount to TWC
Adjusted for AMCX, CVC currently trades at a ~20% FCF/share discount to TWC shares – though growing slightly faster in its ‘cable-only’ FCF/share
  Leveraged Spin-Off
As part of the leveraged spin-off, AMC Networks will incur ~$2.43B of new debt (~5.2x LTM AOCF), consisting of:
$700m Sr. Unsecured Notes @ 7.75%
$1.15B Term Loan A @ L+200bps
$575mm Term Loan B @ L+275-300bps
New $500mm Revolver – undrawn
  Timeline
11/18/10: Board authorizes exploration of possible AMCX spin-off (Rainbow Media) 
12/16/10: Board authorizes management to move forward with spin-off
06/06/11: Board approves the leveraged spin-off of AMCX
06/16/11: AMCX when-issued trading under ‘AMCXV’; CVC trades with due bill between 6/16 to 7/1
06/30/11: S&P index change effective date
07/01/11: Ex-distribution date, AMCX begins trading regular-way
  S&P 500 Index Re-weighting
CVC is a member of the S&P 500 – index fund investors hold ~11% of the public float, or ~25.5mm shares of CVC)
As a result of the spin-off distribution, the CVC share price will adjust accordingly on July 1st, resulting in no change in CVC shares to buy or to sell by Index fund Investors
On July 1st, Index fund investors will receive 1 share of CVC (price adjusted) and 0.25 shares of AMCX
AMCX will replace Boyd Gaming Corp. (BYD) in the S&P MidCap 400
Bottom Line: Net sale of ~2mm AMCX shares (~3% of public float)
S&P 500: ~6.3mm shares to sell
S&P MidCap 400: ~4.3mm shares to buy
  Case Study: Madison Square Garden (MSG)
CVC spun-off MSG last year – listed on 2/10/2010
MSG was not added to an S&P index, so index funds holding CVC had to sell MSG shares around the effective date
MSG traded 5.0mm shares (~13.5x ADV) on the effective date and 4.5mm shares the following day (~12.2x ADV)
  Comparables
Viacom (VIAB): Operator of MTV Networks, BET Networks, and Paramount Pictures
Discovery Communications  (DISCA): Owner of The Discovery Channel, TLC, Animal Planet, OWN and other networks
Scripps Networks Interactive (SNI): Operates HGTV, The Food Network, DIY Network, Cooking Channel, Great American Country and The Travel Channel
  Risks
Programming Concentration: AMC’s current programming lineup has strong ratings and ad momentum – this may not be the case going forward. New programming may fail to catch with viewers
Affiliate Renewal Risk: If AMCX is not able to renew affiliate agreements at higher rates, earnings and FCF would be affected
Advertising Slowdown: With ~37% of revenues from advertising, any material ad market slowdown would adversely affect the company
Technology Risk: Alternative forms of distribution or changes in the way media is consumed may affect AMCX
Dolan Family Control: While the Dolan family retains control post-spin, they have been far more investor-friendly over the past few year
  Valuation
AMCX is trading at ~11x ’11E EBITDA and ~9x ‘11E FCF vs. ~9.5x ‘11E EBITDA / ~14x ‘11E FCF for peers – though it has far more attractive growth profile
I believe AMCX should trade at premium to its peers given its ratings momentum, higher leverage profile and its potential as an acquisition target
12x ‘11E FCF implies a AMCX share price of ~$49/share – with each turn of leverage resulting in >$6/share in equity value
  Conclusion
AMCX is likely to be a strong growth story over the next several years as it expands its international reach, grows its subscriber base and ramps its advertising revenues
AMCX is positioned to benefit from increasing affiliation fees and advertising revenue due to rising viewership ratings for its flagship AMC network, and an expanded subscriber base for the smaller Sundance and IFC networks
AMCX relatively high leverage and FCF generation will enable rapid de-leveraging that will accrete value to equity-holders
Ultimately, I believe AMCX will be acquired by a larger entity once it ‘safe harbor’ concludes
  VOOM Lawsuit (8-K)
In 2005, subsidiaries of the Company entered into agreements with EchoStar Communications Corporation and its affiliates by which EchoStar Media Holdings Corporation acquired a 20% interest in VOOM HD Holdings LLC (“VOOM HD”) and EchoStar Satellite LLC (the predecessor to DISH Network, LLC (“DISH Network”)) agreed to distribute VOOM on DISH Network for a 15-year term. The affiliation agreement with DISH Network for such distribution provides that if VOOM HD fails to spend $100 million per year (subject to reduction to the extent that the number of offered channels is reduced to fewer than 21), up to a maximum of $500 million in the aggregate, on VOOM, DISH Network may seek to terminate the agreement under certain circumstances. On January 30, 2008, DISH Network purported to terminate the affiliation agreement, effective February 1, 2008, based on its assertion that VOOM HD had failed to comply with this spending provision in 2006. On January 31, 2008, VOOM HD sought and obtained a temporary restraining order from the New York Supreme Court for New York County prohibiting DISH Network from terminating the affiliation agreement. In conjunction with its request for a temporary restraining order, VOOM HD also requested a preliminary injunction and filed a lawsuit against DISH Network asserting that DISH Network did not have the right to terminate the affiliation agreement. In a decision filed on May 5, 2008, the court denied VOOM HD’s motion for a preliminary injunction. On or about May 13, 2008, DISH Network ceased distribution of VOOM on its DISH Network. On May 27, 2008, VOOM HD amended its complaint to seek damages for DISH Network’s improper termination of the affiliation agreement. On June 24, 2008, DISH Network answered VOOM HD’s amended complaint and EchoStar Satellite LLC asserted counterclaims alleging breach of contract and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing with respect to the affiliation agreement. On July 14, 2008, VOOM HD replied to DISH Network’s counterclaims. The Company believes that the counterclaims asserted by DISH Network are without merit. VOOM HD and DISH Network each filed cross-motions for summary judgment. In November 2010, the court denied both parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment. The court also granted VOOM HD’s motion for sanctions based on DISH Network’s spoliation of evidence and its motion to exclude DISH Network’s principal damages expert. The trial will be scheduled after DISH Network’s appeal of the latter two rulings.
  In connection with the Distribution, CSC Holdings and AMC Networks and its subsidiary, Rainbow Programming Holdings, LLC (collectively, the “AMC Parties”) have entered into an agreement (the “VOOM Litigation Agreement”) which will provide that from and after the Distribution date, CSC Holdings shall retain full control over the pending litigation with DISH Network. Any decision with respect to settlement will be made jointly by CSC Holdings and the AMC Parties. CSC Holdings and the AMC Parties will share equally in the proceeds (including in the value of any non-cash consideration) of any settlement or final judgment in the pending litigation with DISH Network that are received by subsidiaries of the Company from VOOM HD. CSC Holdings and the AMC Parties will also bear equally the legal fees and expenses (above amounts currently budgeted for the remainder of 2011). A form of the VOOM Litigation Agreement has been filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this Information Statement forms a part, and the foregoing summary of the agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the agreement as so filed.

MFA Financial (MFA) is a Hybrid mortgage real estate investment trust (mREIT) run by a highly experienced management team with a very impressive long-term track record.  MFA’s mortgage portfolio has a number of uniquely attractive characteristics given our view of near and intermediate term economic trends.  We also believe that the prices of a significant portion of the company’s holdings have been conservatively marked and that the process of revaluing these through reserve releases has only started, suggesting an upward bias to the stock’s book value over upcoming quarters.  Further, like most mREITs in today’s market, MFA pays an attractive dividend yield and trades at a discount to its most recently published book value.
  I will spend a good part of this writeup looking at MFA’s comparables because I believe the VIC would benefit from a broader discussion about mREITs beyond this particular name, and the opportunities and pitfalls that abound in the sector.  I know mREITs are controversial, and agree that most of the biases against the sector are legitimate.  The most prominent detraction centers on the fact that these are highly levered vehicles that have gorged upon assets that have been artificially inflated for some time and that the bond bubble is just now beginning to burst.  Many mREITs are fairly recent creations, and some were obviously concocted solely to satisfy retail’s pining for yield in a ZIRP environment.  Since 2007, over $65 billion in equity capital has been raised in the sector. 
  On the other hand, many management teams are touting how much better capitalized mREITs are than theU.S.banking sector, and that they may be the financiers to take up the slack as the GSEs withdraw from residential lending.  While the debate here makes interesting cocktail party discussion, I hope the posts to this thread will focus less on the unscrupulousness of Wall Street, the stupidity of politicians, etc., and more about timely ideas and insights on specific names in the sector. 
  I think it’s clear that there will be some carnage here as the great bond unwind progresses, and as always this comes with the opportunity to generate decent money from good research.  This sector is much more diverse than the armchair commentators appreciate, and to dismiss mREITs as all just highly levered bond funds at the cusp of a secular bear market conveys ignorance of the varied nuances of the names in the sector and the opportunity that lies here.  Apologies for the lengthy preamble, now on to business…
  First, at the risk of losing the attention of those familiar with the sector (if I haven’t already), I want to be clear about the terms I am going to use.  The mREITs can be broadly classified into two major categories:  those that focus on “Agency” assets and those that focus on “Non-Agency” assets.  Agency assets are guaranteed by the GSEs (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, etc.) and are regarded as having an implicit guarantee from the U.S. Government.  Though there can be some debate about this, the vast majority of market participants believe that these have no credit risk and the incremental yield they offer is due to uncertainty about the timing of the principal prepayments (which is effectively an option in favor of the borrower) rather than the possibility of default.  Because prepayments tend to accelerate as rates go down (leaving the investor with more cash to reinvest than anticipated in a lower rate environment) and decelerate as rates go up (leaving the investor with less cash to reinvest in a higher rate environment), movement in rates in either direction are unfavorable to the MBS holder.  This challenge facing the manager of an Agency mortgage portfolio is referred to as “negative convexity”.  Negative convexity is especially problematic when rates have been trending down for some time because managers are holding assets that are trading well above par (recently average portfolio prices in many mREITs were above 108) that run the risk of substantial loss as they prepay at par.  Agency assets are often bought as securities collateralized by pools of mortgages with certain characteristics that can help the manager model expected potential prepayment rates.  For example, pools of unseasoned (i.e. recently issued), higher coupon fixed-rate mortgages tend to prepay more rapidly than pools of lower coupon, highly seasoned mortgages.  Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) and fixed-rate mortgages that reset as adjustable-rate mortgages (usually referred to as “Hybrids”, but here I will refer to as “ARM-Hybrids”) also tend to have very high prepayment rates.
  Non-Agency assets are mortgages that for various reasons (loan size, borrower’s FICO score, Loan-to-value restrictions, etc.) did not meet the criteria for a GSE guarantee, and therefore have credit risk.  These can be either residential or commercial mortgages.  They tend to trade at higher yields because the investor must be paid for both credit risk and negative convexity.  Typically the higher the credit risk perceived on the asset, the less the manager will be concerned about its negative convexity.  That is because highly credit intensive assets tend to trade at large discounts to par (often at 80 cents on the dollar or less) and thus prepayment at par is a very positive outcome that need not be hedged.
  So to summarize, Agency mREITs own portfolios of Agency assets and focus on managing negative convexity, while Non-Agency mREITs own portfolios of Non-Agency assets and focus on managing credit risk and, depending on the asset, negative convexity as well.  To muddy the waters a bit, the mREITs that own both Agency and Non-Agency Assets are often called “Hybrid mREITs” - nomenclature clearly intended to confuse us with the ARM-Hybrid mortgage product mentioned above.
  In addition to the variation on the asset side, mREITs can also differ widely in their funding, leverage, and hedging strategies.  Agency mREITs tend to be more levered because Agency yields are quite low and a fair amount of leverage must be used to generate returns that can compete with equities.  There is an active funding market for Agencies, and Agency mREITs often use repurchase agreements (“repos”) that can be as short as overnight and as long as several months.  Because of the short-term and price-sensitive nature of their leverage, Agency mREITs employ hedging strategies to mitigate the impact of rate changes on the price of their assets.  Those with longer-term, more volatile assets tend to be more sophisticated in hedging out the impact of moving rates on their book values.  The better-hedged ones will often purchase swaptions, which have positive convexity, to offset the negative convexity of their portfolios, as opposed to merely using swaps, treasuries, or other interest rate shorts to hedge out the portfolio’s rate risk for a single point in time.  Some with shorter term assets tend to be more concerned with hedging their funding costs with the view that book value will be less volatile given how quickly their assets pay down.
  By now it should be clear that mREITs should not all be tarred with the same brush, and the sector offers a great variety of ways to express one’s view, or lack thereof, by taking long or short positions in different names.  Our intermediate-term view is to take the Fed at its word that it will reduce its outright purchases of longer maturity securities in a halting and data-dependent fashion but will continue to anchor the short-end of the curve near zero for perhaps somewhat longer than is necessary.  This implies a fairly steep curve for the next two years at least, with the tail risk being that rising inflation forces the Fed to reluctantly abandon its ZIRP sooner than anticipated.  With this as a backdrop, the following is why we like MFA using various criteria, both on an absolute basis and relative to comparables.
  Management
As we transition to perhaps a secular bear bond market, management quality is paramount.  This management team appears to us to be among the best in the business.  MFA first listed on the NYSE in April 1998.  Stewart Zimmerman, the Chairman and CEO, has been a director of the company since 1997.  Ronald Freydberg, an Executive VP, has been at MFA since the beginning as well.  They have more experience than virtually any team in the sector and they have navigated through several major interest rate cycles.  These guys think and operate like value investors.  If you listen to their calls and presentations, they are understated but highly confident that they know a cheap asset when they see it and they know how to manage around the risks.  Rather than write more about this, let’s save a thousand words and put a picture up:
      This is not the hourly on Unipixel over a two week short squeeze.  This is MFA over 13 years.  At the time they presented at the KBW conference in June, they were up 728% since January 2000, or 17.3% annualized.  Note that it’s important to focus on total return if you wish to verify this, as regular and special dividends are a significant component of the performance (something that the VIC seems unable to measure properly when computing the total return on our ideas!).
  Strategy
With improved housing fundamentals so widely evident, Non-Agency credit risk seems to be one of the few places remaining where home price recoveries have not been fully priced in.  We like MFA’s Hybrid strategy, which allows them to shift between Agency and Non-Agency product as opportunities present themselves, but we think the U.S. is only in the middle stages of the improving residential mortgage credit cycle and that credit risk will be easier to manage than negative convexity over the next year or so.  We are therefore biased toward the Hybrids with a large Non-Agency representation in their portfolios.  The table below lists comparable mREITs trading at similar discounts to book and their apportionment of equity capital to Non-Agencies as opposed to Agencies.

  Importantly, MFA has historically held off from accreting the discount on its $5.3 billion in Non-Agency assets by holding the discount amount in credit reserve.  As housing appreciation has decreased the loan-to-value ratio of the collateral in this portfolio from 105% at the beginning of 2012 to 90% recently, they have been releasing these reserves so that the discount can begin accreting toward par.  This had the effect of raising the unlevered Non-Agency yield from 6.8% to 7.15%.  Over the past 12 months they have released $224.3 million from credit reserve to accretable discount.  There is still another $1.3 billion remaining in credit reserve that could potentially be released.  Even a modest percentage of this would be very significant relative to MFA’s $2.5 billion equity value.
  MFA’s $7 billion Agency portfolio is 63% Hybrid-ARMs with less than 33 months to reset and 37% 15 year fixed rate MBS.  The Hybrid-ARMs tend to prepay very fast, and this combined with the very short average time to reset makes the duration of the majority of their Agency portfolio very, very low.  Note that the 15-year fixed paper amortizes at twice the rate of a 30-year fixed rate and with prepayments the average life of even the longest part of MFA’s Agency portfolio is inside of 5 years.
  Portfolio Risk
If we had to choose only two data points for measuring an mREIT’s risk, the first thing we would look at is the “shock table” that estimates its portfolio loss (offset by hedges) given specified shifts in the yield curve.  The second thing would be portfolio leverage, which really gives us an idea of the quality of the shock table’s estimates.  The higher the leverage, the more likely it is that the shock table will differ from reality.  Summarized below is the estimated loss to book value for each comparable assuming a parallel 100 basis point rise in rates, along with their portfolio leverage (debt/equity) at June 30, 2013.

  As the table indicates, while MFA is not the least exposed of the comparables to further rate volatility, it has the lowest leverage and it is more likely than most to be right about its estimate of risk.  Apollo Residential does have lower sensitivity and also fairly low leverage, and we like that one as well.  However, it is important to note that Apollo only lowered its rate exposure by selling assets and increasing hedges after rates had already risen during the second quarter.  Apollo’s book value per share fell from $21.72 to $18.63 between March 31 and June 30.  Net of the 70 cent per share dividend, that is an 11.5% drop in book value.  They then dutifully closed the barn door after the horse had already run away. 
  By contrast, MFA’s book value per share fell from $8.84 to $8.19 during Q2, which represents less than a 5% drop after adjusting for the 22 cent dividend they paid.  Since we view rates as more likely to stabilize at these higher levels over the next couple of quarters than to rise yet another 100 bps, we are willing to accept the moderate amount of rate risk that MFA currently has.  In our view, the fact that MFA was already at its low duration level and didn’t feel forced to buy insurance after disaster struck provides further evidence of management’s competence and ability to stay disciplined through the cycle.  Apollo only went public in April 2011 and here perhaps is where the difference in experience becomes meaningful and that is why we see MFA as a good potential long-term, compounding investment.  Finally, if one wanted to speculate on rates stabilizing or going down, the more rate sensitive mREITs might be good candidates.
  Dividend and Income
Dividends are only as good as the income that supports them.  A 15% dividend yield without income support can actually be worse than a 10% dividend that is fully supported.  We focus on the income yield and view dividends in excess of that yield as potential negatives for at least two reasons:  one is that an unearned dividend will eventually have to be cut and the market doesn’t like surprise dividend cuts, and the other is that it says something about management when the don’t recognize or try to fool the market about the earnings power of their business.  The table below summarizes the last quarter annualized income and dividend yields of the mREIT comparables.

  The higher income yielding mREITs are Western Asset Mortgage (WMC), AG Mortgage (MITT), and CYS Investments (CYS).  Coupling this with the prior table, CYS offers its high yield with concomitant interest rate risk (a 22% loss to book on a 100 bps rate rise).  WMC and MITT are very well hedged but have high leverage (8.9 times for WMC and 6.9 times for MITT).  This means the hedges could easily go awry in a disruptive rate environment and we could see larger than expected hits to book value.  MITT might be an interesting speculation for its high yield, full current coverage of the dividend, strong hedging, and relatively modest leverage.  The next step would be to research whether the prospective income on its portfolio is as high as the most recent quarter’s was.  We believe MFA can maintain its current earnings level for the foreseeable future and therefore continue paying its dividend at the current rate.  Since risk management trumps yield in our view, we are content with the lower 10.3% yield offered by MFA. 
  Price to Book
All things being equal, we of course always want to pay the lowest price possible for our assets.  The mREITS are now trading at historically low price to book multiples, even though their assets currently offer better spread income than they have in years and one could not easily recreate most of these portfolios from scratch today.  The discount to book value for each comparable is listed below.

  Note that we have adjusted MFA’s book value down by the 28 cent special dividend they paid earlier this month.  MFA trades at the lowest discount to book value of all of these comparables.  It may be, though, that the market is onto something and you get what you pay for.  Long term quality at a modest discount may be better to own than a potential donut at a huge discount.  It is important to note that since the value of the assets and the hedges for each of these portfolios changes from moment to moment, the book value at quarter end may be very different from where it is right now.  Our sense is that things have not changed meaningfully from June 30 for these names, but we have only checked a few of these.  Interestingly, many mREITs provide enough disclosure to estimate book value fairly accurately at quarter end, and yet the market does not seem to price it in until the number is actually reported.  This is an exercise that can be very profitable immediately following volatile quarters and an insight that we suggest VIC members consider sharing for profitable short term trades.
  Expense Ratio
We have a strong bias against high expense ratios (our definition is management fees plus other expenses over common equity).  High expenses tend to be correlated with poorer long-term performance.  AAGold offered a very interesting insight on one of the VIC topics threads.  Referring to closed end funds, he pointed out that since expenses are a virtual certainty no matter what the assets are in the underlying portfolio and how they perform, they should be capitalized using a low discount rate, with the result that high expense ratios should confer surprisingly large discounts to fund NAVs.  Thus, an expense ratio that is 1 percentage point too high should be capitalized at a lower risk, say 5%, rate and confer a 20% discount to NAV.  This concept should reasonably apply to mREIT portfolios as well as closed end funds (and, for that matter, operating companies whose management teams consistently destroy even a small amount of value each year, but that is another discussion).  The last quarter’s annualized expense ratio for each comparable is presented below.

  MFA has one of the lowest expense ratios despite the quality of its management team.  Note that Capstead has the lowest “basic” expense ratio, but it also charges an incentive fee equal to 10% of income above a hurdle rate of 10% on equity capital (they include preferred shares in this equity capital).
  Conclusion
While we typically put a price target on our names, it’s not clear that this is appropriate here, given the constant flow of dividends.  MFA is a high quality, well managed mREIT that has delivered impressive returns for over 13 years.  If you buy this below book and hold it for 10 years, we expect you will earn a very nice return.

    Situation Overview:  Drive Shack (DS) has been written up twice by greenshoes93 in 2019 and in 2020 pitching DS’s preferred. Today, the company has shifted capital allocation priorities to building its Puttery venues – a lower capital and higher return concept that can potentially offer multiple years of investment opportunity. Please refer to greenshoes93’s writeup for the history and evolution of DS from controlling the traditional golf business to its current state.
  What does Drive Shack Do?
DS is an owner/operator of golf-related leisure and social entertainment venues and courses with food and beverage offerings. Their three main operations are:
American Golf Co. (AGC): AGC is one of the largest operators of traditional golf courses in the US. Under AGC, DS operates 60 golf courses.  The majority of their courses (44) are located in California. AGC serves ~3 million visitors per year and generates steady cash flows. Over the past years, management has sold practically all of their owned locations and the cash was used to fund the development of their Drive Shack venues. I expect traditional golf to generate revenue of ~$250-$260M (~$210M Golf + ~$50M in F&G) and EBITDA of ~$20.
Drive Shack Venues: Drive Shack venues are very similar to TopGolf.  The company has 4 venues today. These are decent venues that are expected to deliver 10-20% returns. Over the past few quarters, management has shifted its capital allocation from these Drive Shack venues to prioritizing its new Puttery venues concept, which offers a higher return investment (+20%) with a lower capital requirement (~$10M) and shorter build time (2-3Qs).
Puttery Venues: This is the exciting part of the DS evolution. Puttery offers Urban Mini Golf venues with food and beverages to Millennials and Urban Professionals. These venues are smaller (15k-20k sq. ft.) and can be located in more urban areas.  Puttery is an already proven concept that DS is bringing from the UK. 
  Why Do I Like Drive Shack?
Attractive Unit Economics: The exciting part of the Drive Shack business is the Puttery Venues.  A typical Puttery venue (15K - 20K sq. ft.) that cost between $7M - $11M is expected to deliver an attractive EBITDA between $2M - $3M (over +20% development yields).  
This is still a concept but modest assumptions of average check per player (~$20 - $25) and reasonable volume assumptions support management’s expectation. The return of corporate events, in addition to private events, birthday parties, etc. can get performance in the upper range of expectation. DS’ Puttery venues target the more affluent customer base and should expect average check and F&B revenue mix slightly higher than similar operations.  See Appendix 1 and 2 for revenue mix and profitability of similar assets.
DS is planning to begin operation of two of its Puttery venues by this summer - the Charlotte and Dallas venues are complete and currently recruiting employees. The Washington DC and Miami locations should also be opening in 2H2021.  Another 3 Puttery venues should be nearly complete in 2021 and management is targeting an additional 10 venues to be opened in 2022. 
If successful, these 17 Puttery locations should be contributing ~$50M of EBITDA run-rate (vs market cap of ~$260M) by the end of 2022.  DS can then continue to recycle the cash flows from its operations and open as many Puttery Venues as possible over the next few years.  
Long Runway with Reinvestment Opportunities: While opening 17 venues is more than sufficient to test/prove the concept and keep management busy over the next few quarters – DS has a robust and growing pipeline of future venues in prioritized markets. If successful, they should have plenty of room to allocate capital at attractive returns.  Accommodating landlords and the trend towards leisure and experience entertainment should also help as a tailwind to expanding these venues in many markets over the next several years. Unlike the Drive Shack concept where DS is following TopGolf, the company has an opportunity to be the leading brand in Puttery within the US. This should also help in finding attractive locations to develop. 
Why do I think it will be successful?  The concept is already fairly successful in the UK. Junkyard Golf, Swingers, and Puttshack are already seeing success in the concept and planning to expand in the UK.  Junkyard Golf sees potential to open ~40 venues across the UK; Puttshack plans to open 25 venues over the next 5-years; Swingers is backed by Cain International (private equity) to expand in the UK and North America.
As a potential right tail surprise - Bowlero, the operator of bowling centers, has 321 locations in North America and serves ~25 million guests per year – nearly 75% of which are in the Top 25 MSAs. These venues have been growing at an average 4-year SSS of ~5%.  There are ~4,000 bowling centers in North America.  DS is going after a more specific and smaller market today and is different from bowling, but it helps demonstrate the size of the US market for leisure and experience entertainment venues.
Strong Management Team:  DS is led by CEO Hana Khouri.  Prior to joining DS, Hana was the National and International Director of Operations at Top Golf. She also spent a year as Wes Edens’ Chief of Staff at Frotress. She has solid experience in opening and running entertainment venues – she has opened over 20 venues while at TopGolf.  In addition, her capital allocation shift to prioritizing investments in the Puttery Venues has been a very promising start. 
She clearly has impressed and earned the trust of Wes over the time she recruited, and her time as his Chief of Staff.  Wes Edens, the founder of Fortress, is the largest shareholder of DS (~8%) and serves as the Chairman of DS.  Hana, at ~38 years old, is young, already very well accomplished, and can grow DS into an impressive franchise. 
Balance Sheet and Ability to Finance Growth:  DS currently has ~$80M in cash and a modestly levered balance sheet.  There should be enough cash on hand to complete the 2021 venue development but will likely need to raise capital at some point in 2022.  By then, we should get a good look at how the 4 open Puttery venues are performing. If successful, my expectation is that DS will likely have decent access to the debt capital markets. After that, cash flow from the traditional golf and as they mature, cash flow from the Drive Shake and Puttery venues should also start contributing to cash to fund future venue developments. With ~$10M development cost per venue, it will take a couple of years before the operation becomes self-financing. Consolidated P&L will also probably not print large EBITDA performance over the next few years as they will likely continue to have pre-opening expenses for their new venues.
Risk to Consider: The outcome of DS will be very path dependant on the success of the first few Puttery venues and how they fund 2022 development costs. Dilutive equity capital raise is a probable senario if the concept remains promising but DS has difficulty accessing the debt capital markets. However, if the Puttery Venues concept fails to deliver the expected results - the modest capital requirement (~$10M) and short development time of these venues (2-3 quarters), should give the board an opportunity to delay or terminate the Puttery Venues program before raising dilutive capital and sinking too much cash into a mediocre business. 
Valuation:  DS is currently trading around a $290M EV.  Management is driving towards operating 17 Puttery venues and 5 Drive Shack venues by the end of 2022; these venues are expected to contribute EBITDA of ~$65-$70M plus an additional ~$20M from the traditional golf. Depending on how management funds the 2022 venue development (debt or equity), I estimate the DS stock should be worth around ~1.5x total revenue - or between $4.50 to $4.00 by next year (+40% upside).
  Size appropriately. This is a proven concept in the UK but is still an early stage concept in the US and for DS. The outcome will be highly path dependant. I expect a limited downside risk if the concept or the balance sheet fails to support the expected outcome. However, if successful, which I expect them to be, DS should enjoy a long runway to deploy capital and create value over the next years.

Gray Television – GTN ($17.50)
I am recommending GTN again. While the original post (8/7/18 at $15) rated poorly, the stock rose 60% over the subsequent 8 months peaking at $25 in early April. See Exit Rec 4/16/19. The key factors supporting that recommendation remain in place and yet GTN has retraced almost the entire move and has recently lagged behind peers NXST and SBGI creating a valuation anomaly and a compelling investment opportunity.  I have repurchased my entire position and then some.
GTN offers Respected, Conservative Management running High Quality TV Station Assets having integrated a Massively Accretive Deal and about to experience a Record Boom in Political Advertising. 
The highly accretive merger with Raycom closed 1/2/19 and all signs are that synergies targets are on track if not ahead of initial guidance. In recent presentations management has been pointing to additional synergies beyond the year 1 synergies previously discussed.  All $80M of synergies discussed at the time of the merger announcement were Year 1 synergies and have already been implemented.  (As an aside, how many management teams include only year 1 synergies when discussing a big merger and the resulting accretion?). The Raycom deal doubled the size/scale of the company.  Massively FCF/share accretive as they only used $200M of stock and $3.4B debt.  Management cites 17/18 pro forma avg FCF jumping from $2.67 GTN standalone to $4.39 combined GTN/Raycom.  Yes, that includes projected synergies but these were straightforward and conservative and as noted are already done.  Also ‘17/’18 does not include a presidential election year and does not capture the rolling impact of growth in contractual net retrans.  To be fair the FCF # does include the use of NOLs, but the recurring # is still close to $4 looking backwards. 
$1.75B mkt cap + $4.35B debt = $6.1B TEV.   $775M - $800M avg ‘19/’20 EBITDA so 7.6-7.8X EBITDA.  HUGE FCF: $4-$4.25 Avg ‘19/’20, so rapid deleveraging and no debt maturities until 2024.
Good Assets: #1 or #2 in 87 of their 93 markets.  Highly rated in both Local News and All Day ratings.  This investment in quality local news drives, higher ad spend, retrans leverage and market share of political ad spend.
MVPDS growth offsetting cord cutting. When people cut the cord many still want the local news/sports.  GTN is part of the package on HULU, ROKU and many others. Have 1.3M OTT subs and growing.  OTT subs doubled from Dec 2017 to Dec 2018.  I am not ignoring the long term risk of cord cutting or broader shifts in TV/content viewing I just believe that GTN and certain other broadcasters have strengths to compete as the landscape evolves. OTT is an overhang to all traditional media companies.  Given the strength of GTN’s stations in their local markets, they have signed distribution agreements with almost all of the meaningful OTT players.  (this is true for NXST as well).   Management teams indicate they are happy with the margins on the OOT revenue.
  Political Advertising will set all-time records in 2020 election cycle. Already starting to percolate.  GTN is in many key swing states, including all of the 9 most competitive Senate races.   Politics is LOCAL.   ‘19/’20 EBITDA/ FCF avg is $775-$800M/ $4-$4.25 but ’20 could be $900M / $5.
Retrans dynamic is built-in growth and will account for over 50% of revs at high margins.  Renewals kick in 2019/2020/2021. Yes, there will be headlines about consents and contracts and blackouts, see GTN-Fox, NXST-ATT/DTV, SBGI-Charter), but the core dynamic is that retrains revenue will grow well through upcoming renewals and some portion of the gains will be shared back to the major networks.  To be clear, the networks want retrains to grow as well, they just want their “fair” share.
Retrans revs are around $600M for the combined company and the $80M synergy target includes a contractual $15M step up to get Raycom onto GTN’s retrains rates.  The larger company should be better able to push retrains and manage reverse retrans exposure.  The combined company should be well position as the next cycle of retrans step–ups kick in in the ‘19/’20/’21 cycle.
  I expect retrains ramp will more than offset flat/modestly declining ad revs over the next few cycles.  GTN and Raycom are significantly exposed to the local ad market. This exposure bears watching over time as a significant risk to my favorable view of GTN (and NXST).
  Another Deal?   GTN is only 24% of TV HH so it is one of the few players who can still do a meaningful deal under the 39% Cap.    If the cap is lifted, GTN could be bought.  The industry continues to consolidate and private equity has been an aggressive participant of late.
FCF yield around 24% now, target more like 15-16% or $25-$28.  Would be 8.5X avg 19/20 EBITDA with a full year of deleveraging.    Has already been $25 this year and political tailwind is just starting.
Longer term ASC 3.0 represents an interesting opportunity for GTN (and SBGI, NXST and others).
  Capex should be around $80M for the combined company and free cash flow should delever debt/ebitda to the mid 4s by 2019 and 3+ by 2020.
  Note Raycom also has some other assets which could generate additional growth asset value over time.
Raycom also still has a meaningful spectrum position.  I am trying to track down specific numbers on this asset.

According to Wikipedia, humans appeared around 300,000 years ago in Africa and began to exhibit evidence of behavioral modernity at least by about 100,000–70,000 years ago. For the vast, vast, vast majority of that time, they have systematically gravitated towards consuming food of increasing quality, food that is more easily digestible, with an attitude around food that favors sustainability, availability and longevity. They also rejected, probably quite quickly in most cases, food that made them sick, and indeed educated younger generations to avoid such food.
Until the 20th century, that is.
Around a century ago humans started to systematically consume increasing amounts of unhealthy food and convince each other to consume it (marketing), to the point of creating giant powerful publicly-traded purveyors of what is essentially slow-killing poison.
Around the 1990s a reversal of this trend began. I will argue is this write-up that today, in 2020, because of the health-related ordeal we are currently going through, as well as other factors, that reversal is ripe for acceleration. Furthermore, there are many countries that have not yet begun to reverse (lots of Ems) who will now reverse. I believe COKE is exposed to this trend (and is more vulnerable than KO) and will experience multiple contraction when things turn for the worse. I think COKE will then suffer from various other misfortunes that happen to companies that are shrinking, like good talent leaking away. This short position that can be accumulated over time following market rallies. There is inflation risk so I recommend pairing it with an inflation hedge of your choice. Following the occurrence of important catalysts, COKE’s should reprice closer to the low-end of its EV/revenue range (say to 0.5x – 0.55x) and then decline further. Right now it trades at around 0.68x.
  Sugar in our Society
Human consumption of sugar (and refined sugar especially) rose wildly as a function of various advancements in society. In Europe and America this occurred quite a long time ago whereas in places like Papua New Guinea it only exploded in recent decades, as they got exposed to our way of life.
Here are a few passages from Jared Diamond’s The World Until Yesterday to illustrate what we’re talking about:
“During those early years in New Guinea I never saw a single obese or even overweight New Guinean”
“..all of them resembling slim western body-builders”
“The non-communicable diseases that kill most First World citizens today – diabetes, hypertension, stroke… [ ]… were rare or unknown among New Guineans living in rural areas”… [ ] … “even among those who did live into their 60s 70s and 80s”.
“Already in 1964 the new killers of First World citizens were beginning to make their appearance in New Guinea.. among those populations that had the longest contact with Europeans and has begun to adopt Western diets and lifestyles”.
“Today.. that westernization is in a phase of explosive growth. In cities, towns, and westernized environments, one commonly sees overweight and obese New Guineans. Heart attacks are now reported among city dwellers.”
“Of the world’s eight countries with national diabetes prevalences above 15%, every one is either an Arab oil-producer or an affluent island nation”.
“Non-communicable diseases associated with the Western lifestyle offer perhaps this book’s most immediately practical example of the lessons that can be extracted from traditional lifestyles”.
That last statement is huge if you consider everything that is contained in the book. And then his section on diabetes is also interesting:
Around the year 1700, sugar intake was only about 4 pounds per year per person in England and the U.S., but it is over 150 pounds per year per person today. A study of U.S. eights-graders showed that 40% of their diet consisted of sugar and sugar-yielding carbohydrates. [Diabetes] is the cause of over $100 billion of American health costs annually (15% of our costs due to all diseases combined).”
“Diabetes and its symptoms decline or disappear in populations under starvation conditions, such as French diabetes patients under the severe food rationing imposed during the 1870-1871 siege of Paris”.
“Although Yemenite Jews were almost free of diabetes upon reaching Israel, 13% of them became diabetic within two decades”.
So clearly sugar has not been helpful to our health, clearly it has spread all over the planet, and so it probably doesn’t have that much growth ahead.
For the virus we’re dealing with, it is no secret that two types of people are more vulnerable to dangers from the virus: older people, and those with certain preexisting conditions. What are these conditions? Here’s an article: https://hub.jhu.edu/2020/06/01/david-kass-obesity-covid-19/
In the weeks since, a number of studies and anecdotal reports have pointed to obesity being a notable risk factor for COVID-19—and often the primary risk factor for younger patients. This month, Kass and two Hopkins colleagues gathered preliminary findings from six ICU units around the United States, concluding in a Lancet report that ""in populations with a high prevalence of obesity, COVID-19 will affect younger populations more than previously reported.""
This risk is particularly relevant in the U.S. because the prevalence of obesity is around 40%, compared to a prevalence of about 6% in China and 20% in Italy.
I think the message is that you need to treat obesity seriously as a pre-existing condition that increases your risks for COVID-19. Maybe you didn't consider that because you're young, and thought of this as an old person thing. But no—if you're obese and you're 25, or 35, or 45, you have a risk factor and you should be appropriately careful.
What about from the physician's standpoint?
As physicians, we've become somewhat inured to obesity in our country since there's so many people with BMIs of 35 and up and you start thinking of it almost as normal. But this doesn't take away the medical realities. With COVID-19, it means your patients with high BMIs may need more medical attention, and their symptoms should be taken seriously—maybe they come for in-person care sooner. This patient needs to be considered as you would others with pre-existing risk factors.
  Right now all eyes are on a vaccine – this is true among the people and on Wall Street. The world isn’t really talking about prevention and long-term health. But a vaccine won’t necessarily be available soon, nor be efficient for everyone, nor necessarily safe, nor trusted by all, etc’ etc’, and eventually people will have to gravitate towards something additional. I believe it will be long-term health care, self-care and a holistic approach to health care. And eventually this will happen even if there’s a good vaccine.
Why? (i) some doctors are gradually being exposed/labeled as imperfect, potentially biased toward pharmaceutical products or biased toward a certain political direction, so more people will act to get their hands around their own health (ii) there will be increasing amounts of software monitoring our health in the future, including self-monitoring using apps and small devices. There will be health scores. Health insurance premiums will be lower for healthier people, especially if there’s some kind of budget crisis, let alone sovereign debt crisis or entitlement crisis (iii) there is a new focus now on what is ‘essential’, a re-organization of priorities in our lives. Health is for sure a big subject there. For example we’re already seeing many employers tell their employees that they should go for a walk in the middle of the work day, they’re purchase mental health support plans for employees who might be stressed, and more.
  Why Focus on Soft Drinks?
There is a lot of literature about junk food and associated diseases available everywhere, as well as a lot of advice about what a proper diet should look like. We all know the issues. So let’s jump the next question: why short soft drinks? Why not play this with a candy or potato chip company?
I’m going to talk about why I prefer this route personally. When I was a kid in the early 90’s, one family member read a monthly health magazine and taught us the ins and outs of what he had read: what is healthy/unhealthy to eat and why. At that age, you remember and apply the information. Since then, I’ve been consuming ever-decreasing amounts of sugar and have always eaten healthier than peers. More importantly, since my teenage years I’ve been observing (and, I won’t deny it, judging..!) other people’s dinner tables and pantry. I think I’ve come to understand trends, tendencies, personal weaknesses etc’. There many models according to which people eat (e.g. consume X every morning; never consume X; consume X when I feel like pigging out; consume X when I’m at a specific place; consume X when I’m in a specific context; consume X but in small quantities; consume X when Y isn’t available...etc’).
There is a category out there that represents the marginal junk food, not only the most vulnerable to being cut out, but also to being cut out for good (i.e. not re-adopted later), and this is true about personal consumption as well as consumption as part of group events. Many people who only cut out one category will often choose that one. And the category I’m referring to is soft drinks.
I personally know (and I’m sure others do too) many people who will not have soft drinks despite eating really bad food otherwise, including: too many meats, low-quality carbs, chips, a diet lacking fruits and vegetables, not enough water, too much alcohol. In fact, I will allow myself to go further: there are people who’ll eat all that junk, plus do drugs and heck, even engage in unsafe sex, yet have dismissed soft drinks from their diet. Furthermore, let us consider baby boomers (or older generations) here: a large number of them are too tired to start optimizing their diet now because it often involves internet research and tedious shopping (for example, changing the types of grains they buy), but a good number of them have nevertheless cut out soft drinks. It wasn’t that many decades ago where a wedding table had wine, water, and also soft drinks; same for business meetings. This has gone out the window in modern society. We no longer institutionally consume soft drinks or juices in sophisticated settings, and this sets the tone. On Instagram, there are no (or almost no..?) influencers pushing soft drinks or even sugary juices, not even Coke Zero. Based on my scuttlebutt, sugary products promoted on social media consist mostly of high-end bakery products. It is important to note also that certain politicians have specifically targeted soft drinks like no other category so on that front too soft drinks are the marginal junk food.
Soft drinks also don’t serve much of a purpose socially. They don’t have a ritual purpose like birthday cakes, or sweets that are rarely bought but that the person has been waiting to consume (i.e. “finally gonna pass by my favorite bakery today”). They are not fun to purchase. They do not come in as interesting as a variety as, say, chocolate. It is rare that it will be purchased for the shared pleasure of 2+ people at once (i.e. let’s get our favorite dessert as share it”). It’s much more of a ‘serious’ individual purchase, kind of like cigarettes, or a ‘faceless’ purchase for a subset of a group without specific anticipation (i.e. you tell the pizza delivery company “sure, I’ll get a Coke with that” but you don’t know/care who among your 10 guests is gonna have some).
  The Future of Soft Drinks
Yet a large part of society still consumes soft drinks. My thesis is most of them will drop the habit, at increasing speed. Where are soft drinks or sugary drinks still being consumed? Everywhere, but especially:
- In the third world, as opposed to first world
- As part of a meal at fast food chains, as opposed to restaurants where it is seldom ordered or not on the menu
- At certain ‘old-school’ social events such as religion-based gatherings, as opposed to more modern events
- At the house of some baby boomers, as opposed to Gen X/Y/Z (I know a couple that forbids ANY refined sugar to their kids)
- In warmer temperatures where one might feel desperate for “something refreshing”
The trend away from soft drinks is a one-way trend and the same applies to orange juice and other juices (practically no one today switches from regularly drinking water to cola). Of course, this is known, so the purveyors of these drinks are hedging by selling things like Coke Zero. But what’s the use of Coke Zero? Even these alternative drinks are useless for society and a lot of those who stop drinking sugary drinks simply switch to water, bypassing alternatives. Those who want caffeine have alternatives that are more logical, like coffee, of which the appreciation is still very much in a growth-bull phase. It’s true that in the 1990’s and 2000’s a lot of the Coke quitters switched to Diet Coke (or Coke Zero) but a lot of people (and I argue, more and more) will simply drop all soft drinks. Today’s zeitgeist is: “why should I buy another product from the same company that sold me the crap product that I am quitting?”. The reputation of the company is a prerequisite to any purchase. Today those who will switch to Coke Zero are mostly those who can’t let go of that cola taste. Youngsters are less likely to take on a Cola habit because there’s less social proof. Family members around them don’t buy it so it’s true there’s a mystery factor, but fellow teenagers are rebelling with way more bad-ass things like the Tide Pod Challenge.
Coke has a lot less going for it these days. Let’s compare where we are today to where were on July 20, 1996, the day Charlie Munger gave an informal talk about building a trillion dollar business, demonstrating why creating and selling Coca-Cola is essentially the perfect business:

Here are some quotes with my comments:
- “On average, each of these consumers will be much more prosperous in real terms than the average consumer of 1884.” - we’ve largely reached the peak I think
- “create universal appeal.” - today there is no more universal appeal for Coke. Many people are turned off.
- “it is easy to decide to design our beverage for consumption cold” - fair enough
- “It is also easy to decide to include both sugar and caffeine.” - these days, you’re losing a big chunk of the market due to the sugar. Caffeine: makes sense, but there are alternative ways to consume it.
- “As we expand fast in our new-beverage market, our competitors will face gross disadvantages of scale in buying advertising to create the Pavlovian condition they need.” - today reputation can’t be bought with money as easily as 100, 50 or 20 years ago. People are learning how to figure out for themselves who’s legit. Things like internet reviews and viral posts make a big dent.
- “And we will carbonate our water, making our product seem like champagne, or some other expensive beverage” - today, this has been completely reversed: carbonated water is associated with soft drinks in the first place!
- “Social proof, imitative consumption triggered by mere sight of consumption” - this is now going in reverse because the popularity of these drinks will be declining and people tell each other about how unhealthy it is.
- “for dieters, ability to insert a sugar taste without inserting sugar’s calories. Also, there will be related beverage opportunities we will seize.” - already discussed above. The related opportunities are also not amazing, I think people will eventually go back to core categories: tea, coffee, water, alcohol (but increased quality & breadth in each category)
  More on the Catalysts for a Secular Decline
Many of the reasons why unit volumes might undergo a secular decline are available directly in COKE’s 10-K and I want to paste that here because it’s useful, even if it partially overlaps with some of what I’ve mentioned:
Changes in public and consumer perception and preferences, including concerns related to obesity, artificial ingredients, product safety and sustainability and brand reputation, could reduce demand for the Company’s products and reduce profitability.
The Company’s business depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. Over the past several years, consumer preferences have shifted from sugar-sweetened sparkling beverages to diet sparkling beverages, tea, sports drinks, enhanced water and bottled water as a result of certain health and wellness trends. In addition, consumers, public health officials, public health advocates and government officials have become increasingly concerned about the public health consequences associated with obesity. As the Company distributes, markets and manufactures beverage brands owned by others, the success of the Company’s business depends in large measure on working with The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies. The Company is reliant upon the ability of The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies to develop and introduce product innovations to meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market, and failure to satisfy these consumer preferences could adversely affect the Company’s profitability.
Concerns about perceived negative safety and quality consequences of certain ingredients in the Company’s products, such as non-nutritive sweeteners, may erode consumers’ confidence in the safety and quality of the Company’s products, whether or not justified. The Company’s business is also impacted by changes in consumer concerns or perceptions surrounding the product manufacturing processes and packaging materials, including single-use and other plastic packaging, and the environmental and sustainability impact of such manufacturing processes and packaging. Any of these factors may reduce consumers’ willingness to purchase the Company’s products and any inability on the part of the Company to anticipate or react to such changes could result in reduced demand for the Company’s products or erode the Company’s competitive and financial position and could adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.
The Company’s success depends on its ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all of its products. The Company has rigorous product safety and quality standards. However, if beverage products taken to market are or become contaminated or adulterated, the Company may be required to conduct costly product recalls and may become subject to product liability claims and negative publicity, which could cause its business and reputation to suffer.
The Company’s success also depends in large part on its ability and the ability of The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies it works with to maintain the brand image of existing products, build up brand image for new products and brand extensions and maintain its corporate reputation and social license to operate. Engagements by the Company’s executives in social and public policy debates may occasionally be the subject of criticism from advocacy groups that have differing points of view and could result in adverse media and consumer reaction, including product boycotts. Similarly, the Company’s sponsorship relationships and charitable giving program could subject the Company to negative publicity as a result of actual or perceived views of organizations the Company sponsors or supports financially. Likewise, negative postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company, The Coca‑Cola Company or one of the products the Company carries, even if inaccurate or malicious, could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of the Company’s brands or the Company.
Changes in government regulations related to nonalcoholic beverages, including regulations related to obesity, public health, artificial ingredients and product safety and sustainability, could reduce demand for the Company’s products and reduce profitability.
The Company’s business and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those governing the production, packaging, quality, labeling and distribution of beverage products. Compliance with or changes in existing laws or regulations could require material expenses and negatively affect our financial results through lower sales or higher costs.
The production and marketing of beverages are subject to the rules and regulations of the FDA and other federal, state and local health agencies, and extensive changes in these rules and regulations could increase the Company’s costs or adversely impact its sales. The Company cannot predict whether any such rules or regulations will be enacted or, if enacted, the impact that such rules or regulations could have on its business.
In response to growing health, nutrition and obesity concerns for today’s youth, a number of states and local governments have regulations restricting the sale of soft drinks and other foods in schools, particularly elementary, middle and high schools. Many of these restrictions have existed for several years in connection with subsidized meal programs in schools. Restrictive legislation, if widely enacted, could have an adverse impact on the Company’s products, image and reputation.
Legislation has been proposed in Congress and by certain state and local governments which would prohibit the sale of soft drink products in non-refillable bottles and cans or require a mandatory deposit as a means of encouraging the return of such containers, each in an attempt to reduce solid waste and litter. Similarly, the Company is aware of proposed legislation that would impose fees or taxes on various types of containers used in its business. The Company is not currently impacted by the policies in these types of proposed legislation, but it is possible that similar or more restrictive legal requirements may be proposed or enacted within its distribution territories in the future.
Concerns about perceived negative safety and quality consequences of certain ingredients in the Company’s products, such as non-nutritive sweeteners could result in additional governmental regulations concerning the production, marketing, labeling or availability of the Company’s products or the ingredients in such products, possible new taxes or negative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against the Company or other companies in the same industry, any of which could damage the reputation of the Company or reduce demand for the Company’s products, which could adversely affect the Company’s profitability.
The FDA occasionally proposes major changes to the nutrition labels required on all packaged foods and beverages, including those for most of the Company’s products, which could require the Company and its competitors to revise nutrition labels to include updated serving sizes, information about total calories in a beverage product container and information about any added sugars or nutrients. Any pervasive nutrition label changes could increase the Company’s costs and could inhibit sales of one or more of the Company’s major products.
Most beverage products sold by the Company are classified as food or food products and are therefore eligible for purchase using SNAP benefits by consumers purchasing them for home consumption. Energy drinks with a nutrition facts label are also classified as food and are eligible for purchase for home consumption using SNAP benefits, whereas energy drinks classified as a supplement by the FDA are not. Regulators may restrict the use of benefit programs, including SNAP, to purchase certain beverages and foods currently classified as food or food products.
  The packaging issue could be a big one. I would note also that the trend toward carrying personal bottles around adds another negative for packaged drinks (and/or unhealthy drinks) because people now often carry bottles big enough to hold enough water for their entire outing.
The issues of soft drinks at schools and soft drinks bought with food stamps are also both key to branding/perception. There is a line that has been partially crossed with schools, that, if fully crossed, will effectively make soft drinks cigarette-like. If the negative perception of sugary drinks grows further, QSRs will also want to drop partnerships simply to defend their brand image. That’s not for tomorrow, but it’s certainly the direction we’re going in.
There is also of course an economic question. Soft drinks are more expensive than water. And Coke more than coffee. You can make coffee cheaply at home but you cannot create cola without the syrup. Plus, you can put together various spices, herbs, ginger and lemon and make something much healthier, tastier and cheaper than Sprite or iced tea. And if you really want the bubbles, there’s Sodastream.
The Cola-Cola brand has other challenges too. Many of us grew up with corner stores named “Coca-Cola” or “Belvedere” (the cigarettes). This partnerships are no longer being created. Another point: in the past decade many people have mostly consumed these soft drinks without seeing the logo - when ordering them in a bar: Rum & Coke, Vodka-seven. You don’t know if they’re using Coke or Pepsi or even some other cola. And you probably don’t care either.
To sum things up: in today’s society, who’s going to convince who to consume more cola?
  Why Short COKE Specifically
COKE is a bottler. It depends on KO’s brand. It is a weaker company, it cannot easily pivot, it doesn’t have the same economics. It therefore has no significant risk of sudden growth. And management certainly isn’t there to get creative and do something because they’ve been fleecing shareholders.
The dividend yield is 0.44% because they have not raised it since 1994.
The company is dependent on KO but essentially controlled by the Harrison family (J. Frank Harrison, III the great-grandson of the founder, who is the Chairman and CEO, plus others). In 2019 Harrison had salary of $1mm + a bonus of another 1mm+, and in the past 3 years stock awards and long-term equity plans have yielded him another 8mm, for a total of 11m each year, even though he owns lots of stock and should just have been incentivized by those holdings alone. Directors’ compensation is around $160-200k each so they’re happy - paid to keep their mouths shut. Good ol’ boy James Morgan, former Krispy Kreme Chairman, is one of them. There are supervoting shares so outside shareholders are essentially powerless, and there’s family on the board. There are also multiple conflicts of interest (business between COKE and the family).
And also: “Morgan H. Everett, Coke Consolidated’s Senior Vice President and a member of the Board, is the daughter of J. Frank Harrison, III, the Company’s Chairman and CEO. During fiscal 2019, Ms. Everett received total compensation of approximately $446,267.”
I find that all of this is a bit excessive. They have executed a bit of a reconfiguration of logistics in recent years with the territory reorg and everything, but it’s definitely not managed to truly deliver value to the shareholders. Let’s just say there’s no plan in place to turn this into a compounder.
And they don’t have the corporate culture to do well in the next 20 years anyway. I was pretty surprised by their “our purpose” page (which..by the way needlessly links to a PDF rather than an HTML page):
https://www.cokeconsolidated.com/files/generalfiles/CCBCC%20Purpose%20Statement.pdf
I don’t have any issue with God at all, in fact it’s nice to have all these values like forgiveness, learning etc’ but (i) I don’t see how this is compatible with where American youth is headed and (ii) selling poison does not constitute doing God’s work, in my view. They talk about “putting others first”. Well.. then just shut down and don’t sell this crap. Besides, if ‘we’ (COKE) put others first, where are shareholders? Are they part of the ‘we’ or the ‘others’?
  Shorting the Equity.
The company has a notable amount of long-term debt, which means equity fluctuates a good deal. What I’d look for in a case like this is to make sure we don’t initiate a position at an unattractive point relative to its historic multiple range. Given the recent rally, we now find ourselves at 0.68x EV/sales which is an ok entry point.

              If it rallies further due to sector rotation there may be a great entry point soon, but either way we’re not at the low point now (which would be around 0.55x). Once the zeitgeist turns against soft drinks I’d expect compression to 0.5x and then a gradual decline as a function of the decline in the top line and the amount of debt. I also expect the family will milk this one on the way down. And if it keeps fluctuating due to financial leverage it’ll be a multiple-ride situation.

I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise do not hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

Overview: Generating revenue abroad and paying employees based in Argentina, GLOB is, for all intents and purposes, an Argentinian exporter of IT consulting services. Just like any exporter, when the peso (ARS) is depreciating, GLOB benefits as $ costs effectively decrease in the short term (the currency adjusts downward faster than peso salaries adjust upwards). But too much of a good thing is usually bad... and that’s what we have here now that  a 30% spread has developed between the official peso (pegged @ 60/1 USD) and the “black market” peso (77/1). Going forward, GLOB’s costs are effectively growing at the black market rate while the ARS/USD exchange rate remains unchanged (peso salaries will inflate quickly while the exchange rate remains flat), forcing the company to pay a “tax” on repatriated dollars used to pay wages in Argentina. 
    Background: Prior to 2015, Argentina had a system of currency controls/export taxes designed to help the government meet its annual budget and build FX reserves without tapping financial markets. This changed after Macri’s election in 2015... controls were rolled back/eliminated in concert with the country’s sovereign default settlement (related to 2001 default). But the good times never really materialized and with economic problems persisting (inflation, peso devaluation, continued trade deficits, etc), Alberto Fernandez (and Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner) defeated Macri in the August 2019 primary. The surprise (landslide) defeat prompted currency controls to be implemented once again on 9/1/19 (@ 60 ARS/$). Macri’s subsequent defeat in the general election of October 2019 means the old guard is back in power (officially as of 12/10/19)... so expect old policies to be used to manage the economy for the foreseeable future. 
Without access to capital markets (the country has started restructuring negotiations w/ IMF and bondholders) and the post-election currency controls still in place, Argentina needs to both plug its budget deficit and raise $ revenue. In late December 2019, the new government announced an Economic Emergency bill which included the follow reforms: 1) an increase in export taxes (soybeans from 25% to 33%, beef from 7% to 15%, and corn/wheat from 7 to 15%); and 2) a 30% tax on all FX transactions. The bill also included new income/wealth taxes, increases in social security payments, and freezes to utility prices... but the two listed are the major initiatives. As a result of these policies (designed to raise dollar revenue) the black market peso has fallen significantly and trades at a ~30% discount to official ARS/USD levels.
GLOB is a US listed stock headquartered in Luxembourg, but it’s an Argentina company. GLOB’s management team and board are all Argentine. The corporate office is in BA. ~30% of its workforce is located in Argentina (albeit down from 70% in 2014). As an Argentinian IT exporter, GLOB earns USD revenue and uses that cash to pay its Argentinian workforce in pesos. When capital controls are in place, domestic costs (white collar salaries) inflate at a rate closer to the black market peso rather than the official exchange rate... meaning GLOB needs to covert USD into ARS at unofficial rates or be subject to a “black market tax” equaling the difference between the official and black market exchange rates.
When capital controls were last in place (2011-15), GLOB circumvented the effective “black-market tax” by buying US$ denominated, Argentine law, sovereigns (BONARs). After holding them for a short, required period of time, GLOB’s Argentinian subsidiaries would then sell these bonds in Argentina for peso proceeds that were close to the implied “black market” exchange rate (read about it in the 20F risk factors). While GLOB could once again buy/sell BONARs to circumvent the “tax”, it’s not so easy this time. Prior to 2015 the country was “negotiating” w/ holdouts (from 2001 & 2010 restructurings) and was steadfast that these BONAR bonds would be repaid in full. As such, the BONARs were liquid, stable and eventually paid in full. Today’s BONARs aren’t that... they will be part of Argentina’s next restructuring. The value of these bonds are extremely volatile (8.75% of 2024 trading @ ~40) and will be permanently impaired (they trade wide to English law bonds). They are not suitable instruments, nor is any other security, to hedge the $/ARS black market currency spread. Anecdotally – have heard that there is very little volume/interest in BONARs from large traders, supporting the supposition that they are not being used today to circumvent the “tax”. 
Thesis: With USD fixed price contracts and 80% of total operating costs in salaries, GLOB is acutely exposed to movements in FX – the Argentine Peso specifically. (PF for the recent Bellatrix acquisition, 30%+ of GLOB employees and most senior mgmt. are based in Argentina.) So now, when GLOB brings USD back to Argentina to pay its employees in pesos... it converts at the official rate. The problem is salaries for these white collar workers and senior mgmt. are going to increase at a rate closer to the black market rate – or ~30% higher. The difference between the two is a tax... and a significant one for a company like GLOB. 
Even more troubling for GLOB, if history is any guide... the black market tax could widen from here as it did during the two year period prior to Macri’s election in 2015 when it averaged 55%. 
  Now, GLOB can pass on some of that tax to its employees – maybe resulting in attrition in Argentina (this has already been reported) and new jobs in Colombia. Or maybe GLOB tries to pass some costs onto customers in new contracts – but presumably that hurts competitive positioning/revenue growth outlook. They could increase the equity component paid to senior mgmt. Just what they’re going to do isn’t clear... but the magnitude of the problem they face is enormous considering estimated 2019 operating income of $85m. Presumably back half of 2020 numbers need to come down materially. (The impact of the tax likely won’t be felt until q3 19 as the magnitude of the peso decline post the primary (8/11/19) will likely offset the black market tax impact for some time.)
 GLOB claims its Peso exposure is de minimis @ 5%. They argue: 1) while Argentine employees represent 30% of total, they only represent 18% of “cost basis” because argentine employees are paid less than employees elsewhere; and 2) peso exposure is further reduced from 18% to 5% through USD 3m rolling hedges and pegging management salaries to the dollar. (Cost basis is defined as all costs – 80% of which are salaries.) Regarding...
 1: I find this hard to believe considering all of senior management is based in Argentina... but defer to the company. Could salaries really look like this? Argentines getting paid 40% of what employees in Colombia, Mexico and India? 
  2: Neither hedging Pesos nor pegging management salaries to the dollar work in the new currency regime. Hedging a pegged currency absent some sort of catalyst won’t work. Pegging salaries to the USD means in real terms management would be taking a 30% haircut when converting USD into ARS. The only way to actually do this would be for management to have opened international bank accounts to accept USD – and argentine tax authorities would have a real issue with this.
As an aside, the strangest part of conversations with management is that while they admit they need to hedge the black market tax just like they did previously with BONARs, the methods they are using/exploring won’t work. This could be due to the fact that: 1) the tax widened has just occurred in the last month; 2) currency depreciation will offset tax for some time; 3) management is receiving USD salaries in international bank accounts. In addition, it’s strange how they also claim at times (??) they won’t be subject to these taxes because they are bringing $’s into the country... and fail to acknowledge Argentine export taxes on agricultural products/oil/etc. 
Other concerns: 1) GLOB has been a 10xer since its 2014 IPO and off 2019 numbers trades @ 40x unadjusted EBITDA, 6.6x revenues and 75x EPS; 2) the company inflates organic revenue growth with misleading disclosures around revenue contributions from acquisitions – for example, on a 8/15/19 call, saying, “it is becoming more complicated to answer that, because as you know we integrate very fast... so it’s not easy to say, the revenues were organic or inorganic” (yet somehow the company uses contingent consideration payments based on year forward revenue targets for every acquisition and can’t calculate organic growth?); 3) Insiders have dumped huge amounts of stock since the IPO; 4) the company never generates significant FCF – doesn’t even disclose quarterly cf statements; 5) quarterly revenue beats becoming less and less convincing – Southwest delay again in q4?; 6) most recent quarter showed significant decline (16%) in larger customer revenue; and most important 7) GLOB announced the acquisition of another Argentinian IT “exporter” for $70m 1 day ($USD!!!!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?) after president Macri was dealt that surprise defeat in the country’s primary (8/11/19), the day the ARS plunged nearly the 50% and 2.5 weeks before the country implemented currency controls (9/1/19).
I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise do not hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.
Catalyst
  Catalysts: It doesn’t seem like numbers are coming down when they issue 2020 guidance (expect 20%+ organic growth and ~17% adj op income). IR seems committed to the narrative that peso exposure is limited. Back half of 2020 is when we should see the impact from the black market tax (for the reasons noted above). Something disturbing is revealed about Bellatrix acquisition/timing or management compensation practices. Customers become increasingly wary of contracts with GLOB due to risks around outsourcing to Argentina (political/social instability?).

2020-09-03,beep899,PAC,GRUPO AEROPORTUARIO DEL PACI,https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/GRUPO_AEROPORTUARIO_DEL_PACI/5768478265,3565000000.0,74.35,"Description
  Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico (PAC-US) is one of three publicly traded managers of Mexican airports. The PAC symbol ADS shares trade on the NYSE. PAC manages thirteen airports in Mexico and Jamaica anchored by the cities of Guadalajara and Tijuana and also the tourist towns of Puerto Vallarta and Los Cabos in Mexico as well as Kingston and Montego Bay in Jamaica. PAC provides exposure to a gradual return of jet travel via an airport with material exposure to leisure travel, a segment which may return faster than business travel. About 30% of passenger traffic through PAC airports is in the tourist destinations mentioned above. An investment in PAC is likely less risky than playing a recovery in jet travel via an airline as the rate PAC charges terminal passengers is set and does not change due to competition which is the case with an airline ticket. Also, unlike jet fuel, the price of which changes constantly, costs for an airport are more stable and predictable.
  Using an EV/EBITDA multiple of 13 and my 2023 estimates which assume terminal passengers return to 97% of 2019 levels, I get a fair value of USD$95 for the U.S. traded shares, or about 25% upside from a recent price of $75. The EV/EBITDA multiple over recent years has ranged from 11 to 16.  However, I think my conservative model does not fully account for a faster return to air travel and/or a strengthening of the peso, both of which would add material upside.
  I believe both of these potential upside events, more travel sooner and a stronger peso, have roughly even odds of occurring. I own the equity in part due to the belief that the downside is in and that these factors may enhanced upside. For instance, my model and fair value works off 22:1 MXN/USD. Even at 21:1 MXN/USD fair value moves from $95 to $100. The peso closed today at 21.66 and the peso chart is beginning to look like it might break through resistance and strengthen further. We’ll see.
  I have not modeled how a faster improvement in travel trends changes fair value, but I believe the potential exists for the desire and, more importantly, the willingness to travel to shift materially out the current fear mode. This could happen rapidly when it occurs sometime over the next 12 months and might start in the next six months. I don’t believe the entire world is going to carry on like this for much longer.
  I am working off the assumption that after a northern U.S. cold weather covid wave happens, but turns out to be less spectacular and with fewer deaths than assumed, that a large chunk of the world is going to move on with life. I am assuming a near return to 2019 travel trends in 2023, but that could quickly become a 2022 if covid is perceived to be behind us. This perception might happen in late 2002 and early 2021 and the market would then only be looking to one out year, to 2022 to make this valuation. I admit this could be wrong and if it is wrong, then at least I have not modeled for it. My model does not assume a return to 2019 travel levels until 2024 (it gets close in 2023).
  PAC’s management of the 13 Mexican airports is regulated by the government through a 50-year concession expiring in 2048. The agreements require the airport manager spend certain amounts on capex as specified in a 5-year Master Development Plan approved by the government. The most recent plan was approved in late 2019. Similar agreements exist for Jamaica. Between the long runway remaining for the overall concession (to 2048) and the recently approved capex plan, much of the near-term regulatory risk is lessoned or eliminated. Arguably, regulatory risk is now to the upside in the near term as the master plan allows for operators to request a reduction in capex or rise in tariffs if Mexican GDP drops more than 5% in a twelve-month period. Mexican GDP is on track to drop closer to 10% this year and thus there may be some relief forthcoming. The reduction in capex could be significant. However, this is not central to the thesis and it is not in my model at this time.
  PAC generates revenues from two sources. Aeronautical revenues are the per passenger amounts paid by the airlines for usage of the airport. Commercial revenues are rents and fees paid by stores, restaurants and service vendors that are located within the airport and on airport grounds. The agreement under which PAC operates is what is known as a ‘dual-till’ arrangement in which regulators only use Aeronautical revenues as an input when setting tariffs. Under this framework, the airport operator is free to manage and maximize commercial (non-aeronautical) revenues to increase company profits. This works out better for PAC shareholders compared the “single-till” alternative in which commercial revenues are factored into rates set by the government. Additionally, tariffs are inflation protected and are adjusted by the government annually to reflect year to year inflation.
  VIC member Par03 wrote up the Mexican shares of PAC in August of 2019 (my write up covers the U.S. ADS shares). I refer you to his writeup for a good description of the business, the growth opportunities open to the company prior to pandemic, which should return, and also some of the relevant regulatory matters.
  Among those growth opportunities include the addition of a runway at the Guadalajara airport such that it can become a hub for connecting flights and in the process take pressure off the overloaded Mexico City airport. These opportunities will be important in the out-years, but are not the driver at the moment. The driver now is a return return of air travelers within and to Mexico such that the business begins to break even and then begins to claw back towards the previous terminal passenger high water mark set in 2019. In this write up I will spend some extended discussion of pandemic in Mexico and speculate how it may play out through 2020 and how that is likely to impact PAC.
  As noted a strengthening peso could be a material source of upside. Also noted is that MXN/USD now trades just under 22. To be conservative my estimates and fair value incorporate a 22:1 peso/dollar. However, at MXN/USD of 21 fair value on my numbers moves to $100. At MXN/USD of 20, fair value on my numbers moves to $108. At MXN/USD of 19 fair value moves to $114. MXN.USD was 18.5 on Feb 19th, immediately prior to pandemic gathering a head of steam worldwide. From the chart below you can see that peso weakness peaked in April and has stabilized at slightly lower levels in the 22 range. It looks ready to strengthen further.             
  Pesos/Dollar, 2-yr chart
          Mexico is an oil producing state and crude receipts are key to the stability of the sovereign budget and thus some component of currency strength/weakness is likely driven by the oil price. Oil may have found a floor, but I am not trying to opine on the commodity’s next move. However, the fact that U.S. production has declined precipitously can only be a positive and as we exit pandemic demand for gasoline and jet fuel is only likely to increase.
  Currency is also likely to improve as pandemic recedes and economic activity picks back up. But a decline in covid is perhaps even more central to a return of air passenger traffic.
  Regarding pandemic in Mexico, August reported covid cases were 23,000 below the amount reported in July, the first month with a monthly decline since the virus began its spread in earnest in the country.  The country is gradually returning states to lower levels of risk and higher levels of activity. See the below links from Mexico Daily News (English).
  Coronavirus cases reach 600,000; August total 23,000 lower than July

  Per Google covid tracking one can see below that cases hit a peak in late July and early August, have decline slightly, and continue to trend at high levels. Deaths (lower chart) have flat-lined at a the high rate reached back in May. Presumably, if cases continue to decline deaths should eventually follow lower.

        While I discuss pandemic within the context of the currency, it also serves as a segue into a discussion of both Mexican domestic business and leisure traveler. Obviously, air travel is not resuming until covid dies down. American and Canadian travelers are not returning for winter vacations until they feel safer. One of the Mexican Daily News articles I link to above says Mexican health officials are looking to October to see a more material decline. I suspect covid trends could indeed play out in that manner. This would be just in time for winter high season at PAC’s tourist destination airports of Puerto Vallarta, Cabo and the two in Jamaica.
  I believe covid will (effectively) end in Mexico because the country’s approach to dealing with covid has been to follow what was the original plan in the U.S.; namely, to flatten the curve enough so as not to overwhelm the hospitals, when possible to sequester the at-risk (which is absolutely not always possible in Mexico because not everyone has the means), but to then let the virus spread because there isn’t any way to stop it and there is nothing else they can do.
  The government has received plenty of criticism, certainly credible complaints can be lodged, but I’m not sure how anyone else could have done much differently given the lack of resources and the reality most of the populations faces. I would add, to Mexican President Obrador’s credit, he didn’t blow out the budget on hand outs.
  I believe herd immunity is coming because the masses in Mexico can’t afford to lock down, they live tight inter-generational quarters, and this all conspires to keep the virus spreading. There is no unemployment insurance much less extra pandemic pay that pays one more than they made if they had worked. Finally, if people don’t work, they don’t eat. Many workers even receive a mid-week advance on their weekly pay so they can eat until payday at the end of the week. The country is going back to normal because it has little choice. Now it will continue to the logical conclusion of herd.
  Look again at the graph above of the positive covid cases. It reached a high level and stayed there. The curve is different than the curve in most countries. Using that google link provided one can toggle to other countries and compare to get a feel. Some successfully crushed the virus. Others did crush it but it is coming back. The Mexico chart shows cases spiked and have never come down. This is because there was no true lock down. But it has, at least for now, plateaued.
  What is exhibited in the chart jives with what we have been experiencing living in Puerto Vallarta. There has been a lockdown in our state of Jalisco, but only for a while and then only somewhat. For example, we continued going to restaurants the entire time. First, we went only to the few restaurants that remained open and with varying degrees of social distancing. Slowly, but soon enough, more restaurants re-opened.
  We also noticed that traffic on the streets during the day was consistently trending back towards our unscientific, eye-ball and memory estimation of normal levels. In fact, traffic has long been back to normal. Parking availability on the street is back to normal low-season availability. We were at a sushi restaurant (for locals, not in the tourist area) this weekend and every table was full and there was a line out the door. On the ride home we saw many restaurants filled to capacity. As activity continues to rise, the case count continues to flat line at a high level.
  Indeed, covid has spread in our locality, Puerto Vallarta. About two months ago we learned of multiple Mexican nationals having testing positive for covid. These Mexicans confirmed they knew of many others with positive tests. We know of two Mexican nationals who died. One was a very nice man who assisted us with obtaining our Mexican residency cards. He had children. It was really tragic because he was young, though he was quite overweight. About a month ago covid began to hit ex-pats we know. Two of them died, one an acquaintance. He was a very friendly man who was involved in local charity and well known and liked by many ex-pats, we among them. No death from covid is a good thing, but at least this man was over 80. Then, beginning about a month ago, no new news about covid deaths or cases among those we know. Nothing.
  More recently – and this is an important anecdote -- we’ve heard that the local hospital where most of the covid treatments occur has also seen a drop off in cases. Through the middle of the summer the reports on the ex-pat Facebook group were of how crazy it was trying to deal with the onslaught of cases. There is an American nurse who is central to this and she was constantly seeking contributions of food and beverages to provide medical workers during and after their shifts. Then, all of sudden we got first reports of the case load dropping and the first hints that the worst has passed.
  By December, I argue, Mexico may be well past peak and demonstrably so. I further argue the U.S. may be seeing the North American fall cold weather outbreak beginning to peak and likely with lower death rates similar to that experience during the U.S. summer outbreak in the southern states. We may have vaccine news. Net: there will be reasons to be less scared and probably a desire to take steps to return to normal coupled with a realization that it is time to move on because we need to move on.
  A great place to start moving on might be a Mexican (or a Jamaican) vacation, much to PAC’s benefit.
  Doesn’t a Mexican vacation in a warm weather paradise is sound particularly inviting after, by this winter, almost a year of lock down by government edict. In places like PV, Cabo and Jamaica one can hang outside by the pool or beach all day, gaze at the ocean in open-air safety. Almost all dining is covid-safer open air. Even most (not all) hotel lobbies are open air. Even many hotel hallways are open air (not all). Seems like a lower risk vacation given the state of the world. Hotel costs (generally in USD) will be lower. Dining and other ancillaries in Mexico cost less than any developed world vacation destination.  Actually, it sounds so good that I may even take myself up on this idea. Oh, wait! I live in Puerto Vallarta full time!  I enjoy this every day! Sweeeeet! I think plenty of vacationers are ready to get back and enjoy it again, too.
  Recently, when Delta cut flights in the U.S. for the fall they actually added flights to destinations in Mexico and the Caribbean. This suggest that they are getting some booking uptake or at least believe it is a good bet on where demand may return earlier. I read this week that American added flights as well. This directly benefits PAC if travelers utilize the opportunity.
  A return of tourist travel offers a solid foundation for PAC’s passenger trends. Business travel is important, too, and may be slower to return. While I absolutely believe more meetings that involved travel will be conducted via video, I’m still taking the “over” on an eventual return of business travel.
  First, I think world-wide there will be a realization that a sale, particularly for large dollar items, is best secured by making an in-person visit and building a relationship via a face-to-face connection.
  I believe those who think they can just zoom in from their home office in jacket, tie and underpants while be scooped by competition that will make the effort to get on a plane and get in front of the client. Granted, this will require clients to decide they will accept visits, but this will come. I argue that clients will also want to vet the people they are hiring. There is risk to one’s own job to purchase a product or service without conducting in-person vetting. I argue that once that threshold is crossed, there will be a wave of businesspeople rushing to get on a plane and show their lack of complacency in general and making an effort to best the competition. We’re not there yet, but I believe we will get there.
  In addition, while I believe business travel world-wide will begin to crawl back I believe in Mexico it may come even sooner. I confirmed with a lawyer friend of mine in Guadalajara that they are using Zoom for certain meetings. However, he thinks this is less suited to the Mexican culture than in the U.S. People do business face to face. He has already been flying for business trips, but so far less so than in the past. He also told the younger lawyers in his shop to stop working at home and get back in the office. Even though there was less work, he said he didn’t want them home watching Neflix all day. He wanted them in the office doing something, anything useful.
  PAC passenger trends have been improving since travel essentially hit full stop in late March and April. The July report of down 62.3%, a number that showed two (technically three) months of improvement got the stock moving.  They report August traffic in the next few days.

  https://www.aeropuertosgap.com.mx/en/traffic-report.html
  The strong Jan and Feb trends were enhanced by the addition of the Kingston, Jamaica airport in 2019 Q4. However, in Jan and Feb passengers in only the 13 Mexican airports were up 9.2% and 11.2%. Still strong.
  In the near-term I believe the upside driver to the stock is continued improvement in year-over-year terminal passenger trends. During the early fall months I believe there is risk the current improvement stalls until we get to closer to winter high season in the tourist destinations and a few more months pass and Mexico shows more improvement in covid tracking trends which should then begin to benefit business travel.
  Compared to 2019, I am assuming combined aeronautical services and non-aeronautical services (which is to say revenues from travelers) is down 39% in 2020 (thus, 2020 over 2019), down 20% in 2021 (thus 2021 over 2019), down ~10% in 2022 (thus 2022 over 2019) and down 7% in 2023 (thus, 2023 compared to 2019).  2021, 2022 and 2023 will grow revenues year over year, but not year over 2019.
  I assume EBITDA falls from 9.8B pesos in 2019, to 4.6B in 2020, then 8.2, 8.8 and 9.5 in 2021, 2022 and 2023. Debt continues at the current level of pesos 24.6B. Cash is currently at pesos 15.7b. Cash flow is negative in 2020, slightly negative in 2021, breakeven in 2022 and +4B pesos in 2023.
  Holding back cash flow is elevated capex in 2020, 2021 and 2022 before dropping materially in 2023 and 2024 per the mandated master plans. However, I expect the company to negotiate for material reductions in mandated capex as their agreement with the Mexican government allows for should GDP drop more than 5% in any trailing 12-mo period. I suspect there will be significant savings and it is likely that 2021 will ultimately be cash flow positive based on changes to the mandated capex. I do not model for this. I also do not model for the potential for higher tariffs that might come out of any renegotiated agreement.
      They have raised cash via debt to cover the capex requirements.the company has peso 24.6b in debt and cash of peso 15.7b.
  Below I provide management’s liquidity discussion from the Q2 conference call:
    “Our balance sheet has remained strong during the pandemic. We have raised MXN 4.2 billion in the Mexican debt market to better position us to meet the capital expenses commitment for this year and part of the 2021. Combined with funds received through 2 credit lines of MXN 1 billion each, we ended June quarter with a cash balance of MXN 15.7 billion, 55 -- 57% in Mexican pesos and 43% in U.S. dollars.
  This amount was higher than expected due to the recovery of some accounts receivable that were not previously forecast. Even with nonimprovements in our cash burn rate and reserving the MXN 4.2 billion for CapEx, this equates to 23 months of liquidity to cover operational expenses, taking in account the refinancing of the short-term debt maturities. This is more than enough to address operating expenses and committed impairment. However, if we need it, we also have the option to raise additional debt.
  We closed the quarter with total debt of MXN 24.6 billion, of which 23% of total debt is U.S. dollar-denominated. Coming due next year, we have some maturity payments of $181 million, divided in 2 tranches during January and February, and MXN 2.5 billion due in July. We will analyze the cash position at the end of this year in order to define if we're -- we'll refinance both loans or only the U.S. dollar-denominated debt.
  With respect to ratios, the net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio stood at 1.13x at the close of the second quarter. As I have mentioned before, to preserve liquidity during this crisis, we postponed the majority of nonmandatory capital investments. Thus, we will continue only with the projects that began in the first quarter of the year and also those that imply cost savings or boost commercial revenues, specifically ongoing construction works in VIP lounges, parking lots and solar panels over the carports.”
    RISKS
  Pandemic re-engages with force this fall in Mexico, the U.S., and Canada causing travelers to continue to forgo travel. The economy, which is improving sequentially from the bottom in Q2, rolls back over and experiences a double dip. Mexican currency, which has stabilized, re-weakens and either trends back towards the 24 to the USD it traded at worst earlier this year, or perhaps worse.
  I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

Summary and thesis:
IAC is no stranger to VIC, and we recommend the early-2020 write-up for background.
In May 2021, IAC spun-off Vimeo (NASDAQ:VMEO). Since that time, IAC is down approximately 20%. We think there are two major reasons for that decline:
1)     Post-event selling: IAC ran big starting in late-2020 as investors anticipated the VMEO spin. Post-spin, there has likely been a meaningful turnover of IAC’s shareholder base.
2)     Angi (NASDAQ:ANGI) share price decline: ANGI is IAC’s largest asset and is down 25% since the VMEO spin.
The primary points of our thesis are:
-          Valuation is now very attractive – we are paying a discounted price for IAC’s assets and those assets possess substantial upside.
o   At current levels, both ANGI and MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) are compelling risk/rewards.
o   IAC’s 2 largest non-traded assets – Turo and Dotdash – are together worth $2bn-$4bn+ and are underappreciated.
o   IAC owns additional non-traded assets worth $1bn-$2.5bn+.
-          IAC has near-to-medium term catalysts through an IPO of Turo and a spin of Dotdash.
-          IAC has exceptionally strong management and a culture wholly oriented around entrepreneurship and value creation, which combined with $2.9bn of cash represent huge near/medium/long-term optionality.
Material to read and thoughts on management and culture:
Before reading this write-up, we strongly recommend anyone interested in IAC familiarize themselves with the Company’s own material.
We view IAC as akin to Berkshire, where the best way to understand it has always been to read its shareholder letters and ingest any other words written or spoken by Buffett and Munger.
Same with IAC.
We think management are brilliant and aligned entrepreneurs, operators and capital allocators who know how and when to take the right type of big risks. IAC’s history of immense value creation is manifest, and it creates value in a variety of ways. IAC has turned so many assets – either developed internally or acquired when they were tiny – into enormous businesses. We fully expect they’ll keep doing that.
And management treats shareholders right. IAC is the rare – maybe the only – sum-of-the-parts story where over time shareholders have consistently realized the actual sum of its parts. IAC – in philosophy and in practice – spins off businesses to operate independently when they are sufficiently mature. They never horde to horde. It’s willing to tear itself down to size unlike any other public company we’re aware of [Melrose PLC, maybe?].
We’d start with IAC’s June 2021 Investor Presentation, 2Q21 shareholder letter, and 2Q21 conference call. Taken together, those documents are a much better version of the pitch we’ll muster. We’ll try to limit this write-up to where we’re additive.
Turo:
Turo is the largest peer-to-peer car sharing marketplace (i.e., Airbnb for cars). If you’re not familiar with the business, download the app.
Very limited financial information is available. However, from various articles and reports we believe the business is generating run-rate revenue of $300mm-$500mm and growing robustly. 2021 has been a boon as widespread rental car shortages have driven demand to Turo.
We recognize our run-rate revenue estimate is extremely wide. It’s also super hard to say what Turo is worth.
ABNB trades at >18x 2021E revenue and >15x 2022. Leading emerging marketplaces in other categories include FVRR, UPWK, ETSY, FTCH, etc. Based on comps, 10x-15x revenue appears appropriate for Turo. It is (likely) growing faster than these comps but remains smaller and earlier in its development.
If Turo can maintain its lead, a high multiple is justified. The economics of dominant, at-scale marketplaces can be extraordinary, and the businesses tend to possess large moats. Turo’s market and potential are huge.
At 10x-15x revenue, IAC’s 27% stake is worth $800mm-$2bn+.
In early August, Turo took the first formal step towards an IPO (https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/turo-announces-confidential-submission-of-draft-registration-statement-for-proposed-initial-public-offering-301350787.html). Accordingly, we expect the market to recognize Turo’s embedded value sooner rather than later.
DotDash:
Dotdash is a leading publisher of online specialty sites/magazines such as The Spruce, Investopedia, Serious Eats, Brides, and many others. https://www.dotdash.com/our-brands/
This business has shown extraordinarily impressive results. To quote from IAC’s 1Q21 shareholder letter: “Dotdash has compounded revenue at 33% annually over the last 3 years while achieving over 30% Adjusted EBITDA margins in 2020. As a point of reference, no company in the S&P 500 grew revenue more than 25% for each of the past 3 years while achieving over 30% margins in 2020.”
The best comp for Dotdash is publicly traded Future plc (LSE:FUTR) which trades at >20x 2021 EBITDA (>7x revenue), and >17x 2022 (5x revenue).
Based on FUTR’s multiples, Dotdash is worth >$2bn. We think that valuation is reasonable on an absolute basis, given its capital light and high margin profile, combined with very large organic and inorganic growth opportunities.
We think Dotdash is near the point at which IAC typically sets a business independent. So, an IPO over the next 12-18 months seems likely.
Taken together, Turo + Dotdash = $2.5bn-$4bn+ of swiftly growing value that will likely be made manifest over 6-18 months. ‘Stub’ IAC includes other non-traded assets worth $1bn-$2.5bn+, in addition to Turo and Dotdash, but currently trades at <$2bn.
Other non-traded assets:
Care.com
In 2019, IAC opportunistically acquired Care.com.
In addition to IAC material, we recommend the 2019 VIC write-up for background on the situation. In summary: Care was a perennially mismanaged business facing reputational issues, but which possessed a solid and modestly growing B2C marketplace business, a nice B2C payments business, and an industry leading and robustly growing B2B business.
IAC paid $500mm for Care.
Under IAC, Care’s direction has been righted and it is growing nicely on all fronts. 2Q21 revenue was $78mm vs. 2Q19 revenue of $51mm. Multiples for businesses like Care have expanded since 2019 as COVID created structural and lasting tailwinds. The combination of right direction + growth + multiple expansion means Care is worth a good deal more than the $500mm IAC paid for it.
We think Care is worth >$1bn today. It is the leading company in its space and is targeting vast and growing markets so could grow into something much larger.
Mosaic Group:
Mosaic is a leading developer of global subscription mobile applications. Popular applications in the following verticals include: Communications (RoboKiller, TapeACall), Language (iTranslate, Grammatica), Weather (Clime: NOAA Weather Radar Live, Weather Live), Business (PDF Hero, Scan Hero), Health (Daily Burn, Window - Intermittent Fasting) and Lifestyle (Blossom, Pixomatic).
Mosaic is not a great business but is also not a bad business. The business generates >$200mm of annual revenue and has been growing modestly.
We don’t know what the cash flow profile of the business is, but if run for cash we assume margins could be quite high. 1x-2.5x revenue strikes us as reasonable.
Search:
This Twitter thread does a good job explaining what the business does:    https://twitter.com/Jake_Langley/status/1406694226063073280.
IAC’s Search business is not a good business and deserves a low multiple, but it gushes cash.
On an LTM basis the business did $73mm of EBITDA. Quarterly revenue and EBITDA since 2019:
  The business is somewhat controversial and at times Google has signaled intentions to make the business more difficult to operate or possibly kill it. Maybe that eventually happens.
It’s very hard to say what it’s worth, but we think the business continues to work for some time and it’ll generate a few hundred million in cash. None of that cash will be reinvested in Search, rather IAC will redeploy it to higher and better uses.

Traded Assets – ANGI:
IAC owns 84% of publicly traded ANGI.
ANGI has been a perpetual problem child of IAC. However, ANGI is currently undergoing the most substantive and important transformation in its history.
[In addition to our comments, we recommend the previously referenced Company material, the May 2021 VIC writeup, or this Twitter thread (https://twitter.com/nsheth12/status/1381752426714128387) for overviews on ANGI’s shift from a lead generation/marketplace model to a fixed price procurement model.]
ANGI’s business model is oriented around lead generation – e.g., when a consumer types in a request for house painters, ANGI provides that lead to interested painters who are local to the consumer. ANGI is paid for the lead but is not directly involved in any resulting painting contract. This has been a successful business model, and if ANGI sticks to it, the business will likely perform well, grow nicely over time, and generate strong cash flow. In our view, ANGI’s market price assumes that outcome.
The enormous opportunity for ANGI is to transition its business model so that it is oriented around transactions, deepening its role in the market and dramatically expanding its value proposition. ANGI has been working toward this goal, envisioning a “fixed-price” marketplace for the procurement of all home services.
That transition would alter the course of ANGI’s business. For consumers, the experience of procuring home services becomes dramatically easier (e.g., 1 click procurement); for service providers, it means that ANGI is providing them much more value (i.e., a fully-baked job, with agreed scope and price, and not just a lead). The result would be greater consumer and service professional engagement, and far better unit economics for ANGI.
But the transition is fraught with obvious difficulty, and pricing home services can be complicated. One house painting job is very different from another (let alone more complex services), and costs vary wildly across different geographies.
Our view is that ANGI has a good chance of pulling it off. We believe the combination of its pole position and strong new management, supported by IAC’s financial backing and long-term orientation, give it a great shot.
But even if the transformation isn’t successful and the business muddles along, we don’t think downside is much from here. As recently as 2018, the business generated >20% EBITDA margins, implying 15x EBITDA on run-rate revenues. We believe, if milked for cash, the business could generate meaningfully higher margins.
If ANGI successfully transitions to the fixed-price model, we believe the business will be worth multiples of what it is today.
So, we think from here ANGI’s risk/reward is fantastic.
Traded Assets – MGM:
In August 2020, IAC announced that it invested $1bn in MGM stock at ≈$17/share. In a letter to IAC shareholders, management acknowledged that the MGM investment – a minority stake in a publicly traded company with minimal online presence – was aberrational for IAC. Management also laid out its investment case, which boiled down to: a) MGM was manifestly undervalued and b) MGM possesses the potential to become a leader in online gaming, and IAC will lend their expertise towards that effort.
Since IAC’s investment, MGM stock is up 150%, primarily reflecting the generally anticipated recovery in travel and leisure businesses.
MGM owns marquee physical casino assets and one of the leading online betting platforms (BetMGM). Shares trade at 12x 2022E EBITDA and 10x 2023E. Fantastic success with BetMGM or a company transforming acquisition of Entain PLC (LSE:ENT) could yield meaningful upside.
Bringing it all together:
Presented below is a summary valuation for IAC. A couple of notes:
-          The downside case assumes the downside case for everything. We think that’s too conservative. While it’s possible ANGI is a flop, it’s extremely unlikely ANGI is a flop and everything else is worth our bear case as well.
-          The valuation ascribes no value to IAC’s value creation machine. We think IAC will create billions in additional value over the next few years and none of that is reflected in the scenarios table.
Taken together, IAC represents a very compelling investment: attractive assets that are growing in value at attractive prices; and a world-class management team that has a track record of creating value and is shareholder friendly.

2019-12-20,ValueGuy,LEVI,LEVI STRAUSS & CO,https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/LEVI_STRAUSS_andamp%3B_CO/7146784399,7858000000.0,19.0,"Description
In March of 2019, Levi’s went public after 166 years as a private company. On roughly $5.7bn of 2019E sales (+5% y/y constant currency) the company will generate $300mm in free cash with EBIT margins of around 11%. Levi’s has less than half a turn of net debt (2.3x lease adjusted) on 414mm fully diluted shares and trades on a forward free cash flow yield of about five percent (10.9x ‘19E EBITDA). The stand-alone Levi's valuation story here is just OK, but Levi's stated that the creation of an acquisition currency was a key reason for the IPO. Coincidentally, this year, Kontoor Brands (KTB), which sells Wrangler and Lee Jeans, spun out of VF group. KTB is slightly less than half the size of Levi's, both by TEV and by revenue.
The top line at KTB $2.5bn ($1.5bn Wrangler, $900mm Lee, $100mm Rock Republic and VF outlet sales), EBITDA is roughly $350mm and TEV is $3.25bn (9.3x ‘19E EBITDA). EBIT margins are about the same 10-11% at both companies, though Kontoor has seen top line declines from the closure of US retailers, while Levi’s has maintained overall growth.
Bondo119’s five-star 2008 report on the Levi Strauss 8.625% Bonds explains the financial resilience of the core Levi’s franchise, and CNBCs engaging primer on the company https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z54JcslYQ_o walks the viewer from 1853 to IPO. Please take a look at both before continuing - they are pretty good. Like other national brands, Levi’s can resist pricing pressure from both online and brick and mortar retailers.
Levi’s pays a about a third of its free cash in dividends (~$110mm in ‘19E) and has an A/B voting class structure. There are about 47mm A shares and 346mm B shares, for a total of 393 million basic shares outstanding. In the IPO, they sold 15mm Class A shares at $17 for net proceeds of $235mm.  The B shares, held primarily by descendants of Levi Strauss (i.e. the Hass family), have 10 votes per share vs 1 vote for the Class A.  So, the Hass family controls the vote by a wide margin. The IPO lockup expires March 17th, 2020. For the most recent company data see the presentation from this month’s non-deal roadshow: https://s23.q4cdn.com/172692177/files/doc_presentations/2019/12/Europe-IR-Deck-FINAL.pdf.
Aside from a recession, the bear case is that the company cannot continue to grow in the face of the closure of retailers that account for roughly half of US wholesale revenue (i.e. 15% of total company of sales).  Although the other half of US wholesale revenue does actually grow, it grows too slowly to offset the effect of retail store closures. For a sense of scale, Levi’s forecasts 300-500 third-party retailer door closures this year (matching the trailing 3-year average).
The wholesale channel accounts for 64% of sales and the direct to consumer channel (online and company store) accounts for the other 36%. Europe and Asia combine for roughly 48% of sales, and the US 52%. Europe (+15% YTD) and Asia (+13% YTD) are both rapidly growing. 87% of overall company sales are of Levi’s branded products.
From a regional perspective Levi’s believes they can open a sufficient number of direct to consumer stores to generate positive growth in the US market, where, again, third party retail closures are pressuring Wholesale revenue. In contrast, Kontoor brands has been struggling with its US wholesale revenue, but without the benefits of Levi’s branded stores, constant currency sales there were down 8% y/y last quarter.
The bear case has some problems.  First, if 15% of global sales decline 20% per year that would be a 3% point drag, at 30% per year that would be a 4.5% point drag; noticeable but hardly determinant. 15% of $5.7bn in sales translates to $855mm of exposure to US wholesale retail closures. Second, US wholesale revenue at 30% of total company sales is actually down from 40% four years ago while the top line has expanded in constant currency terms in each of those years (’15 +1.2%, ’16 +3.1%, ’17 +7%, ’18 +12.7%). As an aside, Levi’s total sales declined -1.4% and -2.9% in ’08 and ‘09, respectively, including 3-5% declines in Americas. Third, in the final analysis people still want to buy Levi’s in the US, the company faces an operational challenge to recreate shelf space – not a decline in organic demand.
Surprisingly, only 5% of total company sales are through the website, 10% including online partner sites. Perhaps people like to try on their jeans before buying, thereby limiting online as a percentage of total sales.  Though even by the company’s own reckoning today, they could be doing more with their online channel. Recall that online and company store (including franchise) sales account for 36% of total company sales. That means 26% of sales relate to company stores.
If 26% of sales are via company stores then $5.7bn x 26% = $1.428bn / 3,000 stores ~ $500k/year in sales per store. This calculation ignores the difference between larger stand-alone retail and smaller footprint shops-in-shops. Levi’s has 3,000 brand dedicated stores including shops-in-shops in some of their 50,000 retail locations spread across 110 countries. Of the 3,000 brand dedicated stores 888 are company operated standalone and 500 are company operated shops-in-shops, implying ~1,600 franchise stores. The company operated standalone stores are spread across 32 countries 1/3 Americas, 1/3 Europe and 1/3 Asia, approximately.
Thanks to improved data analytics, the Levi’s believes it can cut the footprint of new stores from 6-7k sqft to 2-4k and better focus the merchandising mix to local tastes. I am not a retail expert, but it occurred to me that if Levi bought KTB and used newly found square footage in Levi’s existing retail stores, this might stem the sales decline at KTB and perhaps lead to growth. Again, I am not a retail expert, but I buy Levi’s only, to the exclusion of Wrangler and Lee, and would simply walk past the other brands if they were in the same store (i.e. limited cannibalization of Levi’s sales from consumers like me).
M&A
In a bear case, Levi’s could overpay, botch the integration, find no revenue synergies and cannibalize Levi’s sales. Worse yet, this would amplify exposure to the, previously manageable, declining US wholesale segment. In the end, one would have to have a view on the compatibility of the big three jeans brands in the same footprint – though arguably that experiment has already been conducted in certain department stores over the years that may have carried all three brands on the same menswear floor. See the link for more from an FIT professor on the Levis, Wrangler, Lee “trinity” https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2018/08/18/vf-spinoff-means-return-of-the-denim-jean-triumvirate-wrangler-lee-levis/#54d162a91d44.
In the bull case, Levi’s could begin putting Wrangler and Lee through their 888 company operated stores (and ~1,600 franchises) and also stop KTB from spending approximately $90mm on a new ERP system. If Levi’s has figured out how to optimize their company operated stores so that their products only take up 1/3 the previously required square footage (as they claim), perhaps that frees up remaining space to offer Wrangler and Lee.
In an all stock deal, the combined company would have roughly $8.2bn in sales, $1.1bn of EBITDA (ex-synergies) and $1bn of Net Debt equivalent to another turn of Net Debt on the pro-forma Levi’s balance sheet. VF only has about 70 outlet stores, so any lease adjustment to the leverage ratio would be comparatively minor.
Using round numbers (roughly right rather than precisely wrong), if Levi’s has 400mm fully diluted shares outstanding at $20 and KTB has 60mm fully diluted shares out at $40, then to get to a 15% premium Levi’s would have to pay $46 and issue 138mm shares. A $46 take out price x 60mm shares = $2.76bn and $2.76bn/$20 per Levi’s share implies 138mm shares required. Then 138mm shares / 400mm existing Levi’s shares would further imply about 34.5% dilution that would need to be offset for the deal to be breakeven from a GAAP earnings perspective (insofar as that may be a relevant standard).
Said differently, a six dollar per share premium today implies $360mm of value that would need to be offset in economic terms to justify the deal, or about 4% of combined company sales. 4% of combined company sales is not an outrageously high figure for expected merger cost savings, setting aside the potential revenue synergies from putting Wrangler and Lee into Levi’s stores.
Overall, I like Levi’s here as storied franchise trading around fair value with limited leverage. As US retail gets turned upside down, Levi’s appears equipped to make sure customers maintain access to their products. In addition, there is a decent rationale for an all stock M&A of a competitor that is not managing the shift in the retail channel very well. After 166 years, it’s time to get long.

Summary
Ubisoft is a leading video game publisher with well-known AAA titles such as Tom Clancy Rainbow Six Siege, Assassins Creed, Far Cry, and Watch Dogs Legion and co-founder Yves Guillomet serving as CEO. We believe an investment in Ubisoft (Euronext: UBI FP) is currently an attractive risk-reward as several factors have put a lid on shares, including: 1) reports of cultural issues at the company; 2) the rotation away from ‘stay at home’ stocks; 3) execution missteps from FY20; 4) recent delays pushing a game launch from FY21 to FY22. We believe management is proactively addressing these issues, and believe the stock offers an ~85% return by the end of March 2022 years with limited risk of material permanent capital impairment.
Investment Thesis:
Summary: We believe that Ubisoft will see an acceleration in revenue and profit growth over the next few years as a result of decreasing barriers to play video games (Streaming / Free to Play), expansion into untapped markets (China / Mobile), and pricing increases (inflation in AAA game pricing). The impact to profit growth will be outsized for Ubisoft as the company has runway to catch up to other western peers in its digital mix, and monetization of ongoing play. We believe Microsoft’s acquisition of Bethesda for $7bn (9/20) draws a line underneath Ubisoft’s share price and limits the risk of permanent capital impairment given the intensity of interest in Video Game M&A from large tech companies launching gaming platforms including Google Stadia, Amazon Luna, NVIDIA GeForce Now and Facebook Gaming, in addition to Sony PlayStation and Microsoft XBOX. Ubisoft’s ownership of IP, large development capability, and broad consumer interest in its existing portfolio make it one of these companies’ most attractive targets.
Thesis:
Video games are structurally attractive, and demand is accelerating; Ubisoft is well-positioned to benefit from these trends.
Ubisoft will see sales and profit accelerate as it catches up to peers in benefiting from additional channels, monetization strategies, and pricing changes.
Active M&A market in video games with well-capitalized players, where Ubisoft would be an attractive target.
Management has an opportunity to address cultural challenges to become a leader in transforming the game industry, which will drive significant shareholder value.
1. Ubisoft is well-positioned as a founder-led company to benefit from the structurally attractive video game market, which enjoys accelerating growth from both near-term and long-term drivers.
Structurally Attractive:
Video games are a structurally attractive market due to the digital relationship that game publishers develop with customers, allowing for ongoing monetization, game level network effects, and high fixed cost leverage.
Declining AAA Launches: Growing complexity of game development– through graphical intensity, story development, multi-player requirements - increases fixed costs, decreasing industry attractiveness for new entrants, and benefits players with existing IP and more certain demand.
AAA titles now cost $100mn+ to develop and require $35mn+ to market, which has consolidated the number of AAA launched per year over the last decade
Near Term Accelerants
COVID: Coronavirus has limited entertainment and leisure options for consumers, with gaming being a significant beneficiary. Gaming has seen an increase in players’ time and also in breadth, with new players using video games to engage socially with others.  It has also benefitted from expanded budgets resulting both from lower spending on other activities and consumer stimulus. We believe there has been a permanent increase in gaming addressable market.
Ubisoft is a beneficiary from this dynamic as one of the AAA producers who generates profits from enhanced engagement as well as launching three AAA titles during the fourth calendar quarter: Watch Dogs Legion, Assassins Creed, and Immortals Fenyx Rising. We expect sales to benefit from the recent lockdowns, benefiting near-term performance and ongoing monetization longer term.
Ubisoft has already commented to the market that Assassins Creed sales are the best in franchise history, and Watch Dogs legion sales have been solid. Immortals Fenyx Rising has received good critical feedback and is positioned towards a different segment than Cyberpunk 2077
Attractive Game Slate: Ubisoft has an attractive future game slate to further build on its strong recent launches that balance new IP with launches under existing franchises, including Far Cry 6, Rainbow 6 Quarantine, and another AAA title in FY22; and Avatar in FY23 as well as the eventual launch of Beyond Good and Evil 2, which has not received a release date but has a film in production. We believe the announcement of a Splinter Cell game would be well-received, which has been teased by the integration of Sam Fisher into other Tom Clancy games
Ubisoft currently has two games in the top 10 most anticipated futures releases according to Gamespot 50 https://www.gamespot.com/gamespot-50/
Console Cycle: We are at the beginning stages of a console transition to PS5 and XBOX Series X. Demand for these consoles are extremely high, and they frequently sell out within minutes of new inventory being released.
Ubisoft is well-positioned with a strong current slate of games that are next gen optimized, including the recently launched AAA titles. Assassins Creed is currently positioned as one of the ‘must-buy’ games when getting a new console.
Long Term Drivers: There are many long-term drivers which are difficult to quantify that are likely to accelerate growth and profitability, including Streaming, Esports, Advertising, and Metaverse “Gaming as a Social Platform.”
Ubisoft is well positioned to capture many of these opportunities due to being a founder-led business, having large development capability, and owning a portfolio of quality IP that engages a broad range of consumers.
2. Ubisoft will see sales and profit accelerate as it catches up to peers in benefiting from additional channels, monetization strategies, and digital engagement.
Ubisoft, alongside Square Enix and Take-Two, is one of a few publicly gaming companies expected to earn operating margins below 30%. We believe this comes down to limited imagination from the market and the benefits the company will reap from the below factors.
Player Recurring Investment: Ubisoft will increase in-game monetization (PRI) significantly in the next few years to catch up with peers as Ubisoft’s players migrate to more recently launched games with more advanced monetization strategies
PRI (excluding mobile) at UBI’s peers is significantly higher – Ubisoft earned 26% of FY19 revenues from PRI vs. ATVI at 45%, EA at 47%, and TTWO at 39%
Ubisoft generated 371mn in PRI with 100mn unique players in H1 2021 or a $7.42 run rate vs. FY20 of $6.00 and FY19 of $6.44 in per active player (which excluded Brawlhalla)
Ubisoft is closing this gap by using strategies proven by peers to drive PRI, including DLC, season pass, multiplayer, and selling cosmetic items to drive in-game monetization
Assassins Creed Valhalla has several enhancements that will drive PRI spend including more activities in the open world, raids and assaults, connectivity with other players, and a settlement camp that players can customize. Ubisoft doubled the post launch content from Origins to Odyssey which we would expect to see again with the strong release of Valhalla
Watch Dogs Legion will include a multiplayer mode, which was not present in Watch Dogs 2
Mobile: Ubisoft will launch a Rainbow Six mobile game in partnership with Tencent in FY22, which we believe will generate 100-150mn in net bookings at 20-30% operating margins:
Tencent has had a successful partnership with Activision in which it developed COD mobile, which has seen 300mn player registrations and is expected to generate ~$400mn of net bookings prior to its launch in China
We estimate the Rainbow Six player base to 1/3 the size of Call of Duty based on MAU estimates from Gamstat.com, which support our $100-150mn net booking estimate.
After the launch of Rainbow Six in FY22, we’d expect more mobile games developed using Ubisoft’s AAA IP and casual games
Take Rate Decline: every 100bps decline in UBI’s platform take rate equates to $20-30mn of additional sales and profit at current bookings levels.
More platforms provide channels to reach consumers beyond Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo consoles, whether it’s Steam, Epic, Google Stadia, and emerging options through Nvidia, Amazon, and Facebook. Additionally, Ubisoft and other gaming companies have developed a direct channel to reach consumers.
Epic has been able to take considerable PC game share from Steam by charging publishers a lower take rate: 12% vs. 20-30%
Ubisoft commented that the of Assassins Creed saw the largest number of PC players, which indicates that channel mix is benefiting margins.
Other game CEOs have indicated that they are pressuring Sony and Microsoft to lower their take rate through these other channels.
Shift to Digital has likely permanently accelerated as a result of COVID and the launch of lower-cost, digital-only consoles.
Digital bookings were 87% of bookings in H1 FY21, increasing from 82% in FY20, 69% in FY19 and 58% in FY18
Games sold through brick and mortar channels carry ~55% margins vs. 70% margins through digital sales.
Additionally, digital sales eliminate second-hand games and allow Ubisoft to capture back-catalog sales for gamers that play older games at bargain prices.
Pricing Opportunity: €75-115mn opportunity
Ubisoft is likely to follow industry pricing changes from Take-Two and comments from other publishers about the price of AAA games increasing from $60-70
Pricing for AAA video games have not changed in 15 years, and industry commentary has described the change as inevitable.
https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/7/21314545/console-video-game-price-increase-70-video-game-ps5-xbox-series-x
If Ubisoft were able to push the price increase through on its AAA titles, the company could see a benefit of €75-115mn or a 15%+ increase in operating profit that would scale with growth.
Ubisoft has averaged ~20-30mn units of new games per year (excluding FY20, which had the challenging launch of Ghost Recon Breakpoint) with an average ASP of €30-35mn
We believe Ubisoft will start to reap these benefits in FY23 due to the quality of titles that will likely launch that year including, Avatar and Beyond Good and Evil 2
3. Active M&A market in video games with well-capitalized players, where UBI would be an attractive target
Microsoft’s acquisition of Bethesda has expanded its lead in content over potential new platform entrants and may catalyze a land grab in video game M&A
Ubisoft is one of the most attractive assets for a large technology company to acquire to seed content for its service
Ubisoft reaches a vast base of players with over 100mn active players across its games with relative value in reach
Ubisoft releases a large number of AAA titles than western peers providing a baseline stream of content for a new platform to attract users
6 Franchises and 11 titles sold over 10mn units during the most recent generation of consoles
Ubisoft owns all of its IP, which limits licensing and exclusivity issues during a sale, which would likely impact EA and, to a lesser extent TTWO
Large Japanese publishers may have a wider cultural gap than Ubisoft. Additionally, Capcom has a family shareholder, and Square Enix has a founder with a large ownership stake that may limit M&A options.
Ubisoft is one of the few developers with a proven capability in live services, which is driving an increasing gap between large AAA developers and smaller ones evidenced by Square Enix’s recent challenges with the Avengers launch
Ubisoft’s cultural challenges have the potential to catalyze a change in ownership now that the company has made the initial changes to remove bad actors
4. Opportunity to become a leader in transforming the gaming industry.
Finally, we see an opportunity for Ubisoft to take its internal crisis and position itself as a leader in trying to solve the cultural problems embedded in gaming, which we believe will benefit Ubisoft, the gaming industry, and shareholders enormously.
We believe the launch of Ubisoft connect and the common gamer profile across platforms is a critical component of addressing toxic culture and eliminating abusive members of the community across multiple platforms simultaneously 
Revenue Opportunity: Women represent over 40% of gamers and 30%+ of esports viewership but are frequently under-represented in online competitive titles such as first-person shooters, which generate high in-game monetization.
We believe toxicity in these titles is core to why women have more representation in viewing these games than playing them – TeknoAssociates estimates that Rainbow 6’s player base is 23% women, bringing this up to esports viewing levels of 35% or gamers would drive 12-20%+ increase in revenues with a significant impact to profitability, due to high drop-down margins vs. 20% EBIT margins.
Additionally, we believe female gamers offer broader partnership opportunities, additional channels for monetization, and the games’ potential to become more broadly integrated in culture.
Analogs to success here are professional sports, which have significantly broadened their viewership base over the last 20 years and enjoyed a step function increase in profits.
Talent Opportunity: In addition to direct revenue opportunities, Ubisoft can unlock a talent pool that may be hesitant to work in game development by addressing the toxic culture associated with gaming, which will improve culture, game quality, and talent at the company.
Including more women and under-represented people in the development process brings more diverse opinions and a wider talent pool in game development and may help develop games that attract a broader audience.
Shareholder Benefit: Ubisoft would see a material increase in profits by addressing the industry’s and its own toxic culture, would improve its brand with gamers, and would better position the company with shareholders who want to do well by doing good, which is growing both in the US and more rapidly in Europe.
Financial Forecast
We see Ubisoft approaching 1bn euros in EBIT in FY23 with the following bridge: 
Launch of fourth AAA title in FY23 (vs 3 in FY21) adds 300mn of sales and 100mn of EBIT (quantified as the amount lost of shifting Far Cry into FY22 from FY21)
Active user growth of 15% to 135mn users (vs. FY20 base of 116mn) due to 6 AAA games being launched in FY21 and 22 and PRI per active user growth from $6.44 in FY19 to $7.50 in FY23 (flat vs. H1 FY21 run rate) adds 250mn of bookings and 150mn of additional EBIT at 60% incremental margins
Pricing change: industry pricing change drives 75mn in incremental EBIT
Take Rate: DTC sales through Ubisoft connect, increasing PC mix on Epic Store, and pressure on console take rates lowers blended take rate by 200bps adding 50mn of profit
Mobile launch of Rainbow 6 game through Tencent and other titles adds 150mn of sales and 50mn of EBIT
EBIT Bridge to ~1bn in FY23
Valuation
We believe continued strong execution, positive releases of AAA games, and cultural improvement will reframe Ubisoft as a high-quality entertainment company with a portfolio globally relevant IP that has exposure to secularly growing end-markets. As a result, we believe Ubisoft with re-rate to a high-teens EBIT multiple and trade in line with video game peers on an EV/Sales basis. At 18x EBIT, Ubisoft would be worth 145 per share for 85% upside.
Potential for Significant Upside with Limited Downside
  Our target price would bring UBI’s valuation in line with Video Game Peers
Risks
We believe Ubisoft has an attractive risk reward. We see the major risks to making the investment as follows:
Competition in FPS: Increasing competitive intensity in first person shooters causes Rainbow 6 siege engagement and player spend to fall. 
Competition from A/AA: Industry tool sets such as Unity and Unreal Engine lower development cost and cause A/AA proliferate and become good enough to engage players and cannibalize time from players playing AAA games.  
Overbuilding from Tech Companies: Amazon has been building some AAA games in the background, which are expected to be launched in 2021. Tech companies may have different economics from traditional publishers and erode the attractive industry economics.
Execution: As seen in the fall of 2019 with the botched development and release of Ghost Recon, video game companies still have some “hit risk.” Ubisoft is not widely regarded as releasing flawless games.
COVID: On a trading basis, we believe shares may be volatile due to the market questions whether FY21 reflected peak earnings

EZ Pawn has been written up three times (on VIC) in the last decade, and has performed exceptionally. If there was ever an industry in the US that is part of the Wild West it is “Alternate Financial Services”. EZPW provides an excellent example of a great business, that 10 years ago had an amateur management team. Under the leadership of then CEO Joe Rotunda they brought process and focus to the business fixing the near term issues that the company had, while implementing a strategy for domestic growth, and most recently a strategy for revenue diversification.
The company is a leader in a space that is highly fragmented in the US, and is just beginning its international growth trajectory. Frankly the growth opportunities remind me of Starbucks 15-20 years ago.
The stock is down almost 50% over the last year, and dropped almost 20% from its recent earnings call. The whole sell side has gone negative. I think this is a classic run for the hills on a growth/momentum stock that both has dropped its multiple and earnings in the short-term but offers an excellent and safe 2-3X if you are willing to wait out the storm.
We think the stock is down for three fundamental reasons
1)      Growth has slowed
2)      Revenue and earnings were guided down to flat for next year as the company makes investments for future growth
3)      Democrats and Elizabeth Warren did well in the election, creating an uncertain regulatory back drop.
  We think that not only has the market over reacted to these issues but they are transient in nature, creating a classic value play.
The business:
I can point you to the previous write-ups (or presentation below) to get a general flavor but as the company describes it they help consumers do 3 things
1)      Sell . You have merchandise that you want to convert into cash. They will give you a bid on it. Lots of reality TV shows on the History channel if you want to get an idea of how pawn shops work. But generally they have only a few categories of merchandise. Jewelry, musical instruments, Tools, DVD/Video games, and TV’s and other common electronic equipment. The common theme, is through eBay and other channels all these items have a pretty predictable resale value. They bid 25-50% of that.
2)      Buy. Like a classic market maker they let consumers buy merchandise they place into inventory from the above category. They also place inventory from forfeited collateral from loans (below)
3)      Borrow: Everyone needs credit, especially low income folks. When you are thin file with no credit file your options are limited. EZ provides this demographics with options for unsecured credit, and secured credit by pledging their cars, and also items (Pawn Loans). These carry high fees, and high returns on capital, with relatively low risk. If folks default they repossess the collateral and move to monetize. Since they have conservative LTV ratios the rarely lose a lot of money in the aggregate.
They have grown quickly in the US by both acquisition and de novo growth. The industry is still highly fragmented with over 15,000 outlets. So plenty of consolidation opportunities in the US. But the company has been very smart and if you think the US is wild and virgin then wait until you get to Mexico where credit is even more limited. The company has moved into establishing a beach head in Canada and Mexico, and has acquired meaningful stakes of publically traded operators in the UK and Australia. They own 30% of the leading Pawn shop in the UK. All said and done now 20% of their business comes from outside of the US. The Mexican market alone offers even higher ROIC (30%) than the US, and we think has at least 10-15 years of unabated growth.
What we like:
It is highly unlikely that banks and the formal financial sector will move into this territory. For one there is reputation and regulatory headaches they don’t want to deal with. Second, they don’t know how to effectively operate with this demographic.
The industry is dominated by mom and pop shops/clusters in the US (and abroad). Which make the value of a large professional platform stand-out. Tech, training, compliance all scale in this industry. The flip side is that as one of the few operators these guys are targets if the regulatory hammer comes down.
High Returns on capital with trivial recourse leverage The Company has demonstrated 20% ish ROIC capability without levering the balance sheet. So little in terms of the kind of surprises we often see with ‘safe’ money center banks. We feel there is both margin of safety on the B/S and the high APR, secured loans they originate to customers.
Room for capital structure improvement. With a 1B dollar company you can do things you can’t do as a small cluster of stores. They have done a securitization in Mexico for example that has lowered the borrowing rate from 19% to 11% in a few months and are renegotiated other loan facilities. These businesses have been traditionally equity funded but given the scale, some B/S optimization can go a long way.
The management team has heavy retail, operational and PE backgrounds. We think they are disciplined on running and growing the business, but most important on capital deployment they are an ROIC driven shop. This discipline has led to consistently higher EPS over time, and they have on average outperformed the S&P 500 by a huge margin over the last decade.
Interestingly we like the fact that the space will get more regulated. It will drive smaller players out (or into the arms of EZ and like operators). It will also clarify regulator expectations which we think will lead to higher multiples in the space (remove uncertainty), and we think regulators are smart enough to know they need this industry to survive since no one else is willing to provide credit to this demographic. You can’t simply cut them off. In fact we think regulators would put these guys on life support if they had to same as they did to the main street banks.
The numbers:
Let’s look at the balance sheet:
Not much to note here except it is trading close to book (when including goodwill), and about 2X tangible book.  More importantly is only 75 mm of net recourse leverage here. The long-term debt of 90 mm is recourse only to the Mexican Sub. Even still it would be low leverage. This is an earning and operating scale, growth story not a balance sheet one. But its good to see a safe capital structure so they can execute on the operating side with plenty of runway.
Income statement:
2012 Revenue $992 mm
Net Income: $143.7mm
EPS for the year was $2.81
ROIC 19%
For 2013 they project range of EPS $2.55-$2.90 which is obviously flat to down which no one liked, but it is driven by the fact that they intend to triple the de novo store openings worldwide which we should see come through in 2014 earnings or even the back half of 2013.
Valuation:
Let’s assume the low end of their range $2.55. They have historically guided very conservatively.
On a 2013 forward basis they trade at
2013 P/E $17.80/2.55 = 7X
On 2012 numbers it is even cheaper
2012 P/E $17.80/2.81 = 6.3X
I think a business with these kinds of returns and growth opportunities deserves at least a 12X multiple which in$ 3.00 of earning 18-24 months out is a double. With some upside on both earning and multiple over that time you could easily see more than 2X return.
Summary:
Investing in EZPW gives you a low-risk way to get a 2-3X return over the next 3-5+ years. You get to invest in an excellent business (20%+ ROIC). Managed by an excellent team, with a history of positive shareholder stewardship (for the most part). And you get the growth in the business for “free”, all with a balance sheet free from recourse obligations.
It is rare to be able to invest in a great business, at a reasonable valuation that has the opportunity to re-deploy capital into the business at the same or better ROIC for extended periods of time.

What we don’t like/risk:
Some really creepy related party stuff, that makes you want to vomit, but the business is soooo good, and the results over the last decade speak for themselves that we are willing to look the other way. They have a dual voting class too. But as I said cheap enough makes you hold your nose. I think this is a legacy issue that has nothing to do with the current team.

Catalyst
2013 numbers are soft because they have decided to focus on de novo development which stores take time to season (7-20 months to breakeven), but over the long-term it seems like a better/safer ROI. In the interim I wouldn’t not be surprised to the company buy back stock if it breaches $15. Also a business with this kind of political profile might not be a good public company and we could see it taken out , but I doubt management would let that happen at anywhere near the current price.",22.437361354704183,9.510251293190015,-10.535304578929424,-38.72437040928814,9.77197874405759,18.03616303406371,28.342446964268532,36.56089620492138

Long shares of Lands End (LE).
This is a pretty non consensus idea in that it's a long idea in the Sears/ESL complex, I can feel the 1 and 2's coming already, but hear me out.  
Here's the thesis: 
Lands End is a brand and business model that's so resilient that a decade+ inside Sears and a few years of someone trying to turn it into a Madison Avenue instead of a Madison, WI brand couldn't kill it.  After a decade of neglect and several years of flat out mismanagement, the company looks to be getting back on its feet and doing what it does well:  selling quality, staple clothing merchandise direct to consumer via the internet and catalogue.  The company has a new, capable management team in place.  They appear to have a credible plan that is already starting to show results.  This business, at its core is pretty good gross margin, capital light, and has high incremental margins.  There is opportunity to further improve margins, inventory management, and drive a further recovery in topline.  As they execute, I expect the economics of this business to show through in the financials and the company to generate good cash flow.  
So what went on?
The Sears out of bankruptcy liquidation story is well known at this point.  Eddie Lampert is basically playing a game of Jenga with Sears' assets as the company heads towards a bankruptcy.  LE is one of the pieces he's pulled out, but unlike some of the other pieces, has a reason for being outside the Sears ecosystem and doesn't look to be a vehicle to funnel cash to the burning dumpster fire that is SHLD the parent, unlike say SHOS.  It's worth noting that ESL's equity interest in LE is now worth more than his equity in SHLD.  
Anyway, inside SHLD, LE was neglected.  Post-spin, they brought in a fly in/fly out CEO, she actually commuted to WI from NYC periodically, from Dolce and Gabanna to ""refresh"" the brand.  By ""refresh"" she attempted to make it more fashion forward.  This had predictable results and the company suffered as comps and margins declined.  What's remarkable is that it did not burn cash over the last 3 years, net debt 3 years ago was $405m vs $395m today, even as they upped capex investments in an ERP.  
In comes new management:
Early this year LE hired Jerome Griffith to be the new CEO.  His background is with fashion brands and his most recent gig was CEO of Tumi, which he sold to Samsonite in 2016.  His plan seems credible:  return the brand to its roots (http://host.madison.com/wsj/business/executive-qa/new-ceo-jerome-griffith-wants-lands-end-to-return-to/article_b03b5f44-5e37-59c3-aebe-1f5d63228d46.html), focus on the product quality and design, increase engagement with existing and lapsed customers through digital marketing, use data & analytics to better the customer experience (help point out things they might like, make sure things fit right, etc.), and look at additional distribution opportunities.  It's worth noting he has a lot of comp in stock and has made meaningful open market purchases at prices above the current quotation.  Since becoming CEO he's acquired 60k shares in the open market, on top of 20k he owned prior, at prices up to almost $20 and he has granted over 100k shares and nearly 300,000 options struck at $18.1.  
Green shoots:
The steps taken at the beginning of the year are beginning to bear fruit.  Comps have been turning and margins have stabilized.  According to management, that trend has continued into the holiday season.  To get a sense of the starting point they have, their active buyer count shrank 30% under prior management.  They’ve recovered 15 of the 30%, but they feel it may have been worse than 30% because an “active buyer” is liberally defined, so there’s opportunity to drive that recovery more.  The reengaged buyers returned with a smaller basket, and there’s opportunity to expand the basket as they return for a second round.  The company is already starting to see evidence of this.  Let's take a look at Q2/Q3 and est Q4 comps in their Direct business and their Retail business, as well as how these LE locations are doing compared to SHLD locations they are in.  
Revenue    Q4 2016    Q1 2017    Q2 2017    Q3 2017    Q4 2017 E
Direct        $398.50    $228.30    $259.90    $290.30    $418.43
Retail        $60.30    $40.10    $42.20    $35.10    $53.67
Total        $458.80    $268.40    $302.10    $325.40    $472.09
                     SSS Direct    -2.60%    -1.70%    5.50%        6.70%        5.00%
SSS Retail    -1.70%    2.10%        3.80%        -1.30%    -1.00%
SSS SHLD    -12.30%    -12.40%    -13.20%    -17.00%    >-15%
                     I think the strong performance of LE inside the dumpster fire that is SHLD is actually remarkable and indicative of the relative appeal of LE.  
The most important business is their direct B2C business, it is the largest and has the best incremental margin profile.  Essentially, gross margin dollars have a very high (80%) flow through rate to EBIT.  The things they're doing to thicken their buyer file seem to make sense and I think bode well for future comps.  Incremental margins for this business are pretty good, a gross margin dollar flows through to operating income at a high rate I estimate about 66%, so at a 42% gross margin, that’s about 28%.  That number could go up a bit as they scale back up.  
Sears Closures:
Presently, LE is in 188 SHLD stores.  All are up for renewal over the next 26 months, 48 of them in January and the bulk of them next January half the remaining in Jan of ‘19 and the rest in Jan of ‘20.  They have already renegotiated terms of the lease and rents for 34 of the stores, the term is 12 months and a significantly better deal for LE in terms of costs.  I'd expect them to deal with the remaining leases in a similar way, ESL's greater equity stake in LE relative to the dollar value of the Sears stake makes me think they'll be friendly about the next batch of leases too.  I estimate that LE will lose about $7m of EBITDA in SHLD this year, improved terms and/or only keeping profitable locations open will only improve that.  
People might think a SHLD bankruptcy would be disruptive to LE, but I don’t believe that to be true.  SHLD stores represent less than $150m or so in 2017 revenues (they have 14 company owned stores that we think do closer to 2m/unit), but they are attempting to run at breakeven.  There’s a little over $60m in assets tied up at SHLD locations, but that is basically inventory and we’re told that it is current and not unique to SHLD.  Closing locations actually generates cash for LE because they’d just liquidate the inventory and move on.  Quite frankly, I think this might be the best thing that could happen even if it creates some temporary revenue headwinds.  The stores locations aren’t great, according to the CFO “there isn’t one location we would open our own store in today”.  They’re B/C mall locations.  
FWIW, the Sears link seems to be a decent part of the reason people don’t like the stock.  This article was published recently, after what was a pretty decent quarter:  https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2017-12-05/lands-end-earnings-new-ceo-old-problems
Other opportunities:
The company has a clear opportunity to improve margins and inventory management.  Management describes the systems as “antiquated” and they’re implementing an ERP which they’re 80% through paying for and ⅔ the way through implementing.  They’re also working on getting lead times down to be more responsive in how they order inventory.  Presently it takes about 1yr of lead time, they’re working to get it to 39 weeks and think they can ultimately get it to 26 weeks.  This investment should help them with their gross margins in the future.  The CFO thinks he can take $40m of cash out of inventory, and it’ll be more than that if/when they close SHLD locations.  The inventory is apparently pretty fresh at this point too so that should help margins as well.  
There’s also the uniform business.  This is about $300m of direct sales.  And while it requires them to keep a bit more instock, the sales are committed and it occurs at a higher gross margin, close to 50% “would not be unreasonable”.  The business was not being run for growth, but to maintain current customer relationships.  The recent Delta win is indicative of the potential here and could be the start of better things going forward.  Delta will be their new largest customer, the previous largest being 8/9% of revenue.  The Delta win actually resulted in American reaching out to them about their uniforms, apparently AA’s RFP is about 1.5x Deltas.  On January 9th LE announced they won the AA business. While they did not disclose the dollar size of the contract, they disclosed they will be the sole supplier of uniforms for 70,000 employees which is 1.8 million articles of apparel items.  So it wouldn’t be unreasonable to think there is $30m of delta revenue (some may start to show up in Q4) and $45m of AA revenue, which is a pretty good tailwind on direct comps for 2018 before they do anything else.  Having not one, but now two flagship customers on board should also help the uniform part win more business yet.  
There is some opportunity for stand alones.  The kind of things where build out is maybe $1m and they hope to do $1.5m in sales and maybe do $300k of EBITDA in a unit.  Another part of the idea is that it will supplement an online/catalogue business.  They’re planning on 4-6 of these in 2018 and I expect them to be thoughtful about the roll out from there.  
Margins relative to peers and valuation:
LE's business model (catalogue/internet focused) is inherently pretty good and cash flow generative, as evidenced by the fact they actually generated cash through the most recent poopshow.  I think there are multiple ways to triangulate the valuation.  LE is capital light, with small amounts of D&A (just under $30m) and reasonable amounts of capex ($35-40m). 
Presently LE trades at a forward multiple of ~10-11x 2018 EBITDA (~$90m my estimate, up from maybe $65m or so when they close out this past year), which is a couple turns lower than peers.  The others in the category don’t have the same opportunity for improvement in revenues and margins that LE does (COLM, VFC, and others have gross margins in the high 40’s vs. LE’s ~40-42%), and this could very well be a much lower multiple than the peer set on 2019 numbers where I think $110-120m+ is pretty achievable.  It wasn't long ago that this business did $150m+ of EBITDA. 
This is the kind of thing that as it starts to go the other way and pick up steam, you get help from the business results improving:  revenue growth, marging improvement, and cash flow generation, which should also lead to a much better multiple.  It's not hard to see this as a $1.5b company.  Which if they delever it some along the way, which should happen with improving EBITDA alone plus cash flow that starts to get generated, and/or start buying back stock could mean good things for stock price.  
What’s interesting is once they’ve righted the ship, there’s a good amount of cash that should be generated and available to either reinvest or presumably, given ESL’s involvement, shrink the float.  Once the ship has been righted, this CEO has sold companies in the past and I could see this being an attractive asset to a number of folks.  
Ownership/Short Interest
ESL owns/controls about 67% of the shares.  Of the remaining 10m or so, nearly 3m are sold short, so short interest as a % of the float is high.  I also think, based on the results coming in, there’s also the potential for a pretty strong short squeeze on a low effective float.  So there may be opportunities to trade around this a bit along the way.
Risks
The green shoots turn brown (Comps/margins turn the other way)
There’s some leverage on this already

INVESTMENT THESIS & CATALYSTS         
Krispy Kreme, Inc. (“DNUT” or the “Company”) went public in July after five years of being held privately by JAB Holding Company. JAB are solid operators but with DNUT they acquired a struggling asset facing troubles beyond their control nor ability to rectify. After mixed performance of its strategy, JAB reduced its stake to 37% following June dividend recap/ July IPO. Krispy Kreme is a stagnant business limited by regional appeal that is only growing at a 1-3% organic growth rate despite increasing the number of points of sale by +50% over the same time period. This fact has been obscured by re-franchising, acquisitions and IPO marketing materials that focus on its +19% total revenue growth. These acquisitions have left the Company saddled with nearly four turns of debt and limited capacity for further inorganic growth. Future performance is predicated on international expansion, increasing the number of wholesale outlets, and raising repeat purchase rates, all of which present significant structural and competitive challenges.
  Meanwhile, its shift away from freshly-baked doughnuts served hot with its push into gas stations and wholesale over the last four years (now accounting for 90% of US doors) has created QC issues and has severely tarnished the brand—now just selling common glazed doughnuts. The concept is in a no-man's-land between made-to-order/ fresh and coffee chains that sell pre-made doughnuts. To further obscure performance at the IPO, DNUT curiously chose not to report SSS or any relevant KPIs. In its roadshow it instead focused on irrelevant metrics like ""media impression"" growth. Expectations are off-base and we believe performance shortfalls over the coming quarters will lead to 50% downside to the stock. DNUT is presently GC.
  BACKGROUND
Krispy Kreme originally went public in 2000 (former ticker: KKD) and was primarily a franchise model with a strong presence in the Southeast. At the time the majority of its locations baked doughnuts on-site in Hot Light Theater Shops and served them “fresh and hot.” This made the SE market particularly well suited for Krispy Kreme given the lack of local bakeries and fact that up until recently far fewer grocery stores in the region baked fresh in-house (that is still in-part the case). The concept offered a unique customer experience (watching your doughnut get made) and delicious product. Growth and performance expectations, however, began to fall short, leading to a tumultuous tenure as a public company. International expansion faltered and problems in domestic expansion arose due to the fact that these locations cost $1M-4M to build out with new locations producing low ROIs, significantly limiting the potential franchisee base. As a solution, the Company created smaller format “Fresh Shops” that serve the same products but lacked the capacity to bake fresh. This set a lower buy-in for franchises with $150k-$1.5M buildout cost but lost was the experience and ability to serve the product “Hot Now.” Once the item cools, it is undifferentiated from any other glazed doughnut (64% of 2020 sales).
  JAB
The Company continued to struggle, failing to resonate and generate brand awareness outside its core SE region. Then in 2016, Krispy Kreme was acquired by JAB for $1.3B (18.3x EV/ forward EBITDA). Part of DNUT’s appeal to JAB was predicated on its belief that they could turnaround the business by implementing operational improvements (digitization, online and delivery expansion, bolster supply chain, etc.) and enhance and expand DNUT’s coffee offering (to attract daily repeat customers). This playbook has been working well with its subsequent acquisition of Panera Bread and Pret but faltered with Krispy Kreme.
  Following the acquisition, JAB brought in new management who expanded into smaller markets and the wholesale channel with pre-packaged doughnuts distributed to grocery and c-store locations through partnerships with Walmart, Kroger, Albertsons, etc. This led to growth in doors but a loss of freshness (products were often +5 days old on the shelf and obviously not hot). Facing quality control issues and even less fresh products, the Company launched a program it calls its “Hub & Spoke Strategy” whereby it bakes its doughnuts through its network of manufacturing facilities and in Theater Shops and distributes them to all its points of access on a daily basis. Even if DNUT is able to reach these locations with fresher doughnuts, the channel and concept itself faces some major challenges:
Almost all supermarkets sell freshly made glazed donuts of comparable or better quality than Krispy Kreme’s which are sold in a box on a shelf versus the grocery store offering which often are displayed on a baking sheet.
The strategy requires a high population density given the low frequency of purchase (average customer only purchases Krispy Kreme doughnuts just over twice a year) thus limiting the model and its economic viability outside urban and suburban markets. Daily delivery also requires a capital intensive fleet of vehicles.
The packaging and presentation are the same so unclear if customers will even notice the change.
One industry expert said he was hearing that DNUT “started shipping frozen donuts and glazing hot in new markets.” He noted that, “cannibalization in specific markets was high given low frequency of purchase” (ie. market cannot support more than a couple locations).
Also noted, “have tapped out the attractive markets and opening in low volume/ low population density areas. Legacy stores look dingy and need overhaul. Opening in highway track stops doesn’t make any sense. Even in the core Southeast region, nostalgia of the freshness was diminished by expansion.”
  Over the course of 2018-2019, the Company acquired its perpetually struggling franchises in Australia (territory rights with 29 locations for $123M), Mexico (231 locations for $76.8M), Japan and US (22 stores for $26.6M) as well as specialty cookie company Insomnia Cookies ($139.5M for 75% interest with 136 locations). This transitioned the business from 90% franchise/ 10% company-owned to nearly the inverse, 86% 14%. DNUT touts that this elevated number of company-owned stores affords it a high level of control over product quality. This may be the case with its stand-alone retail locations but clearly is not the case with its in-store kiosks and displays where it has a natural reliance on its retail partners to drive traffic growth at its DFD locations. The reality is that refranchising was a means to bailout struggling franchisees and optically boost revenue growth as part of its repackaging into the IPO.
  Prior to being acquired, the Company made multiple attempts to increase coffee sales. As the owner of a portfolio of coffee chains (Peets, Caribou, DE, Espresso House), JAB should have been better suited than anyone to leverage those assets to grow DNUT’s coffee sales. These efforts did not gain traction and an attempt to develop a Krispy Kreme branded coffee failed as well. Coffee currently accounts for ~5% of revenue, approximately the same level as 2016.
  Here are the most noteworthy insights about the turnaround that we learned (these are direct quotes):
Restructuring the company was unsuccessful. Reducing 30% of its employees, without planning/foresight, had a massive backlash. The company not only lost control over its franchisees and thereby sales and quality, they also have not opened any new markets in the last 4-5 years. Buying out international franchisees, without understanding the markets or their business model, has led to massive debt.
The brand has been driven into the ground to a point of no return.
Absolutely no focus on a coffee program. They don't believe in it, despite the great coffee chains JAB owns. Each of the international markets has their own coffee program, coffee beans, coffee machines - no consistency in quality or branding. Top management has always taken the stand that KK is a doughnut concept.
JAB strength is great at delivery and online ordering and when they bought Insomnia Cookies they brought in an exec from Panera who pushed the needle.
  UNIT GROWTH & INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION
Following its July IPO, the Company had 9,575 outlets--1,527 retail shops (378 larger footprint theater-style, 1,149 smaller stores, 199 Insomnia cookie locations) and 7,849 DFD doors (kiosks and wholesale shelves) in 30 countries. The International growth leg of the bull story is limited by the fact that in every new market it enters, it needs to establish its brand from scratch. One of DNUT’s competitors told us that they abandoned their expansion into Europe given QC and ingredient procurement challenges, the need for a local team (higher overhead per region) and most significantly cultures that consume less sugary snacks and prefer local bakeries when they do. They also noted they never pursued entering the Canadian market given Tim Horton’s dominance. The international markets where Krispy Kreme already has a presence have underperformed and struggled.   
  COMPETITION
The domestic doughnut market is mature and saturated. Brick and mortar competitors include large national chains like Dunkin’ Brands (DNKN), Tim Horton’s (privately held by 3G), Cinnabon (privately held by Roark Capital), to a lesser degree Starbucks (SBUX) and emerging franchise concepts like Duck Donuts. At the local level DNUT competes with independent coffee shops, bakeries, cafes, local gourmet markets and grocery store bakeries. At the wholesale level, its product is nearly indistinguishable from doughnuts baked in-house at grocery stores.  
  CATEGORY DECLINE
The domestic “indulgent food” category (which includes baked goods, confectionery, and ice cream/frozen desserts) is mature and stagnating. Overall sugary snacks sales volumes have been on the decline in the US due to improved health awareness/ diet and a movement away from highly-processed sugar snacks like doughnuts. According to Euromonitor the category declined from 2017-19, experienced a boost from pantry loading during the pandemic and is now expected to grow at an annualized rate of just 20bps from 2020-2025.
  The average American may lack health awareness but it is pretty universally understood that doughnuts are very unhealthy, particularly ones with 32 ingredients like DNUT’s glazed. They are essentially a cliché of what not to eat. According to our research, unlike candy bars, ice cream or other sugary snacks which many people eat on a weekly basis, consumer purchasing trends of doughnuts are such that they are typically bought on special occasions such as birthdays, when on vacation, etc. The average customer only purchases Krispy Kreme doughnuts 2.5x a year, making it a very low average customer repeat concept. Part of management’s plan to reaccelerate revenue growth is to increase purchase rates to three to four times per year. Our conversations with former employees and competitors indicate this is unattainable. Competitor Duck Donuts has been growing units fairly rapidly and developing a bit of a cult following. A former executive from that chain said that having a customer return even three times per year is very aspirational.
    FINANCIAL PROFILE & VALUATION 
Management claims that having 73% of its locations company-owned affords it a high level of control over product quality when in reality it is not only highly-reliant on its retail channel but is now an asset intensive business that only derives less than 3% of its revenue from royalties. Management blames its poor 2020 performance on the pandemic impact yet its grocery and channel partners never closed and there were only limited closures of its locations (most of which have a drive-through offering). In some regards, DNUT should have benefited from aspects of the pandemic where people temporarily reduced their eating standards. Regardless, the expectation of 10% annual revenue growth while maintaining margins is unrealistic given the shift towards healthier eating habits/lifestyles, various other elements outlined and model’s sensitivity to inflation (in particular its asset intensive distribution network).
  The Company has very low earnings quality with lots of addbacks—FY2020 net income was -$61M versus adjusted net income and EBITDA of $42M and $145M, respectively. It is also now a very capital intensive business, spending $98M on capex last year and $52M so far YTD. DNUT is currently trading just below its IPO price of $17 per share or 20x EV/ forward adjusted EBITDA. On an absolute basis this is a very rich multiples for a challenged business. DNUT is even trading at a premium to where JAB acquired the business (18.3x EV/ forward EBITDA). Based on its franchise mix and growth profile, the stock should trade in-line with Bloomin’ Brands (BLMN, 21% franchise), Texas Roadhouse (TXRH, 15%), Brinker (EAT, 33%), Darden (DRI, 0%) and Cheesecake Factory (CAKE, 0%) or bakery good companies like Hostess (TWNK) at 8-14x EV/ forward EBITDA. This equates to $5-$11 per DNUT share, representing a 40%-70% return on the short. 
  We could see a scenario where the stock really cracks once people look at the numbers more closely and gain a better understanding of the challenges the Company faces. Sell-side initiated last month and none of them could substantiate the current valuation (removing some sell-side promotion risk).
  OTHER RED FLAGS & CONSIDERATIONS   
The largest technical risk is that DNUT becomes a meme stock given its ticker and retail awareness of the brand. The beginning of options trading, which seems to be a big trading boon for IPOed meme stocks, has now passed. These trading spikes in names like HOOD seem to have become very short lived when they do occur but is indeed a risk in the event of a buy-in.
In June, several weeks prior to IPO, JAB undertook a $500M dividend recap which ultimately reduced its ownership to 37% of S/O following the offering.

AutoZone – no stranger to VIC -- certainly looks cheap. Industry leader + very good long term business + strong owner-orientation + Over 25% after-tax returns on capital + 6% square footage growth for years to come + no serious SEC/Legal/Liquidity issues does not seem to = less than 11 times this year’s earnings. Of course, if looking cheap were all that mattered, I wouldn’t need to invest in the stock market. In fact, there are some potential reasons to think AutoZone isn’t anywhere near as cheap as it looks at 11X earnings. I’m here to tell you why those reasons are wrong.

Brief History

AutoZone was founded in 1979 as a division of grocery wholesaler Malone and Hyde, which I believe was the subject of the first-ever cash LBO. KKR spun AZO out of M&H in 1987 (FYI) and brought it public in 1991. Central to the thesis, AutoZone was originally named Autoshack, but caved to the wrath of Radioshack’s IP lawyers and changed its name. Recently, AutoZone turned around and sued Tandy for implementing “Powerzones” within Radioshacks. AutoZone lost again. Okay, not central to thesis, but that really does seem like slap in the face.

AutoZone has always been a terrific business with store economics at the very top of the automotive after-market industry.

In 1991, AutoZone had 598 stores, did $818m in sales, $79m in EBIT, $44m in net income and $0.33 in split adjusted EPS. In FY04 ended 8/04, AutoZone had 3420 domestic stores, did $5.64b in sales, $999m in EBIT, $566m in net income and $6.56 in EPS on diluted shares of roughly 81 million. Sales, EBIT, net income and EPS have grown at respective 13-year compounded rates of 16.0%, 21.6%, 21.7% and 25.6%. The stock, despite currently trading at 11X earnings, has compounded at just under 20% since its IPO.

Even Briefer Industry Overview

With its 3500 stores, AutoZone is the largest retailer in the Do-it-Yourself (“DIY” – selling parts to consumers) aftermarket auto parts industry. Its largest competitors in the DIY business are Advanced Auto (AAP), CSK Auto (CAO), O’Reilly’s (ORLY) and Pep Boys (PBY), though ORLY is 50% Do-It-For-Me (“DIFM” – selling parts to service shops), while PBY has a significant service bay business. Of the three big DIY shops, the mix is roughly 85% DIY and 15% DIFM, with all three having pushed into the DIFM market in recent years. Most estimates have the large DIY chains accounting for 30-40% of the market, with the remainder consisting of a declining base of smaller chains and mom and pops. Wal-Mart has been in the category for many years, but has not been anywhere near as significant a force as it is in many other categories.

Promotion or markdown driven competition is very unusual in the industry. Most participants believe that parts consumers are relative inelastic, at least insofar as responding to big sales promotions, and thus rarely compete on that basis. This is an extremely slow turn business, with intensive inventory breadth (but little depth) required in the hard parts area. While industry growth has picked up slightly, as the fastest grower (ORLY) has gotten larger and AAP has shifted from acquisitions or organic growth (5-6%) net industry growth is still probably only 1-3% when mom and pop attrition is included.

Current Situation

Soon after Eddie Lampert took a big stake in AutoZone in the late 1990s, new management came on – led by CEO Steve Odland and CFO Mike Archibold -- and the company immediately began to improve operating margins from good to great. In the last five years, operating margins have jumped from 11-13% to around 17%, despite little if any benefit from comp-driven SG&A leverage. In fact, absolute comps have worsened, and in recent quarters have materially lagged AutoZone’s auto aftermarket competitors.

In March, AutoZone announced that CEO Steve Odland was jumping ship for Office Depot, and that comps had declined 7% for the first four weeks of its third quarter (mid Feb to mid March). The stock has since dropped from roughly $98 to $83. Subsequent to the announcement, there has been some speculation (confusion) over how strong the 2004 comparison period was, and thus how exactly how bad the 7% decline really was in context. Consensus estimates of $7.44 for the year-ended August have not come down following the announcement.

Eddie Lampert is a Cow Milking, LBO Aping, REIT lover

Given its capital returns, operating history and reasonable growth prospects, AutoZone’s current market valuation is really only justifiable if (1) earnings are unsustainable or (2) leverage is distorting the multiple.

Margins

Has AutoZone’s concurrent margin expansion and same store sales compression over the last few years left it with bloated and unsustainable operating margins? Is ESL helping to drive a cow milking strategy here, or is something else at play that will naturally erode AZO’s peak margins as comps continue to fall? Will AutoZone sell Martha Stewart hood ornaments?

At roughly 17%, AutoZone’s operating margins are far superior to competitors, its own historical record, and in fact are maybe the 5th or 6th best in all of retail. And margins continue to improve despite negative comps, which is very unusual in a non-turnaround retailer. For example, excluding one-time items, EBIT margins actually increased 120 basis points (15.1% to 16.3%) in the first half of FY05, despite comps being down 1-2% for the period. AutoZone has credited its 5-year margin improvement to category management (including significantly increasing private label penetration) and some low hanging fruit in expense reduction. Notably, competitors have also improved their margins since 2001, which they, too partially credit to category management.

After a decade of consistently posting positive mid-single digit comps, AutoZone began to see SSS ease in 2003, and since then they have continued to worsen. 2003 SSS were +3% (after +9% in 02), dropping to flat in FY 2004, including a –3% Q4 summer. Comps were again –3% in Q105 (last fall), and flat in Q2 ended February. The only other data available is the –7% four week period after Q2, which is worse than any quarterly comp in AZO’s public history. While competitor comps did worsen somewhat in recent quarters, they remain ahead of AZO’s numbers. Most directly, AAP’s comps in the DIY business were +2.8% in its Calendar 04 (compares to roughly -1% for AZO over the same period) and +5.6% in the December quarter (again compared to –1% or so for AZO). CSK, which had a strong 2003 comp-wise, ran more closely to AZO for 2004, at around –1%.

One reasonable possibility and occasional sell-side accusation is that AutoZone’s expense scrimping is simply coming home to roost, and that under-investing in things like labor relative to competition is starting to show up in customer traffic. This seems validated by AutoZone’s substantial operating margin advantage (17%) over AAP (9%) and CSK (7%). But those numbers are misleading.

For one, AutoZone owns 58% of its locations, whereas both AAP and CSK lease the vast majority of theirs. This obviously distorts comparisons at the EBIT margin level. If AutoZone leased all of its stores, rent expense would likely have been higher by $140-$150mm in FY04, lowering margins from 17% to 14.4%, already making the gap much smaller than it appears. AZO also has a small amount (my guess is $75-$100m) of very high margin software sales form their ALLDATA diagnostic product, which probably brings comparable retail operating margins close to the 13-14% range. Of course, that still leaves a hefty margin advantage. But you would expect such an edge given that AZO’s DIY business is still vastly more productive than any of its competitors. DIY sales per square foot at AZO still run in the $250 range, versus $190-$210 psf for AAP and CSK. In addition to productivity AZO has a natural gross margin advantage in two huge private label brands (Valuecraft and Duralast) which account for more than 50% of sales, a figure which no competitor even approaches. This issue becomes even more clear when you look at cash SG&A, ex rent, spent per square foot of retail space. AZO at $77 per square foot actually spends more than AAP ($73) and roughly the same as CSK – and this includes corporate overhead, where AZO has the most scale.

In sum, I don’t believe AZO is under-spending. While margins are higher than competitors, they ought to be, and the gap is not as wide as it appears. I (and the company) do not see any reason why operating margins should decrease in the future, particularly given the general lack of promotion and markdown pricing as a competitive strategy in the DIY business. In fact, AZO still believes it has some opportunity to improve its cost efficiency, albeit at a slower pace than recent years.

So Why Are Comps So Poor

AutoZone blames its absolute comp performance on gas prices, and its relative comp performance on store maturity. Historically, auto parts stores have opened at 60%-65% of full volume and ramped to maturity over 4-5 years. At the end 2004, only 22.8% of AZO’s stores were less than five years old, compared to 50% in 1999. In addition, any improvements AZO made in its Chief Auto and Auto Palace acquisitions in 1998 were long baked in. So some of AZO’s comp compression over time is simply a function of store maturity. When I model typical a store ramp and the changes in AZO’s store maturity profile, I estimate that aging has taken roughly 3% off the natural comp rate in recent years. AutoZone strongly believes the rest of its comp deterioration has been caused by the increase in gas prices, which both directly impacts its customers’ wallets and tends to restrain miles driven – a demand driver. While gas prices have obviously increased markedly and intuitively should hurt their business somewhat, it’s tough to nail down the impact with any precision from the outside.

As to peer comparisons, it’s true that AZO’s average store is older than competitors, including AAP. But excluding ORLY, AZO’s percentage of “immature” stores is actually similar to its competitors, making the comp disparity less simple to explain. While average store age is likely playing a role, I believe the bigger difference actually comes from competitors (AAP and, to a lesser extent, CSK) improving their operations. Both CSK and AAP are in significant part roll ups of other chains. AAP had acquired 600 Western Auto and Parts America store from Sears in ’98 and 671 Discount Auto Parts store in 2001 – this is roughly half of their store base. Both chains have historically had a much larger percentage of under-performing stores than AutoZone, and AAP has done a nice job bringing the laggards up to par in the Advance format.

Of course, competitor improvement is not exactly the hallmark of a great investment, but I think there are two important points to made here.

One, while competitors are getting the benefit of some natural mean reversion, they are still very far from AutoZone’s industry leading DIY psf productivity. I believe that while AAP and to some degree CSK have done well to improve their businesses, the ultimate level of reversion is likely limited as AZO has some permanent advantages. In addition to having the best known brand in the industry, AZO also has two of the leading parts brands (Duralast and Valucraft) as private label exclusives. They have the most clout with suppliers, as shown by their industry leading vendor financing (payables at 92% of inventories, far ahead of competitors), a unique database of store-specific warranty information allowing particularly customized inventory planning, and, maybe most importantly, a base of 3500 locations that largely represent intelligent site selection by a very successful, single organization as opposed to a conglomeration of various defunct chains.

Two, AutoZone’s comp numbers should be put in some perspective. While they have worsened recently, the overall 1-2% decline in the last twelve months has in fact come during the greatest YoY gas price increase since it’s been a public company. This after a dozen years of consistently positive comps. And AutoZone’s two years of depressed store openings – 2000 and 2001 – meant a maturity mix tilted away from ramping, easy comp stores in 2004 and 2005. There is no evidence that long term demand in the industry, driven by miles traveled and vehicles 7+ years old, is departing from its 4% annual growth. The SUV craze is just beginning to enter its prime aftermarket years, and SUVs are particularly strong drivers of this business. Overall industry square footage is not growing rapidly, and there has been no palpable increase in supply pressure from non-auto chains (i.e. discounters).

Admittedly, -7% is an ugly number. But this came during a four week period that is (1) the lightest volume period in the third quarter; (2) a kind of inflection period where winter transitions to spring and is perhaps unusually sensitive to weather; and (3) apparently was comp’ing against difficult good-weather 2004 four week comparisons. The entire third quarter year-ago was a +2%, versus flat in the second quarter. Thus, some decline from Q205 flat comp wasn’t surprising. If the rest of the quarter picked up from the –7% as I expect, and comps comp in at –3% to –4% for the quarter, I think a scary announcement turns into a distant hiccup. Beginning the fourth quarter, AZO’s biggest as it is the summer and 16 weeks long, comparisons get markedly easier as last summer marked the begging of gasoline price pressure and a –3% comp.

Leverage

Apart from peak margins and lagging comps, there has been some criticism that AZO has juiced EPS by buying back shares financed in part with increased leverage. AutoZone carries $1.9b of (almost entirely fixed) debt, which gives it a debt/equity ratio of your standard GSE. Over last seven years, it has spent $3.7b repurchasing more than half its stock (82.5m shares), leaving it with 79.8m shares outstanding, and so has begun to look like a slow going LBO. But this company is nowhere near as levered as it looks. By owning more than half its stores, meaning including the land underneath, AutoZone is simply exchanging financial leverage for the lease leverage that most supposedly debt free retailers (and aftermarket competitors) carry. I believe that AutoZone’s owned properties alone, including land undervalued on the balance sheet, could generate sale-leaseback proceeds that could pay down as much as 2/3 of its debt. Suddenly you’d see debt decrease to a very small number relative to EBITDA, margins recede toward “normal” as rent replaced interest expense, and a lot of cheering from the bleachers… but no economic benefit. As it is, AutoZone manages its debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating, which means a 2.1X Debt/EBITDAR (including capitalized rent in debt). I don’t believe AutoZone is anywhere near dangerously levered given its consistent earnings history and store ownership profile, and if fact I don’t believe it is more levered than most putatively debt free retailers who lease all their stores. As a result, I think the bottom line earnings power to equity is a perfectly appropriate measure of value to capitalize, and I think financial risk is low.

Odland’s Departure

Steve Odland brought a very quantitative, return on capital based approach to the business, and helped generate significant shareholder value. He came from the grocery industry, and helped really drive working capital reduction (AZO basically runs with negative working capital now) which has helped turn the economics of an AutoZone store from very good to terrific. His replacement, Bill Rhodes, is a long time AutoZone operations guy, though he does have an accounting background. Happily, Bill also drinks from the return on capital chalice, and plans to run the business for profits (quaint) and returns on capital. AutoZone’s managers at multiple levels have been and will continue to be compensated based on various EVA and capital returns measures. They will continue to use free cash flow to open stores at 6% year, and then repurchase stock if it’s priced reasonably. Bill has worked in just about every area of the company in his tenure, and does not believe there is any need to increase expenses or investments, such as labor costs.

Obviously, owner-orientation is buoyed by ESL’s significant stake in the company (roughly 27% -- originally bought in 98-01, then sold some in Dec 03 at $100, then bought more last fall in the mid $70s) and Eddie Lampert’s board presence. While AutoZone may not be the first ticker on Eddie’s My Yahoo page these days, it is unlikely that this company would do anything obviously contrary to shareholder interests. Finally, I would point out that I have met several members of AutoZone’s management team, and the talent ran much deeper than Steve Odland. The CFO Mike Archibold, in particular, is a very helpful, data driven manager focused on capital returns. Finally, it's reasonable to wonder why Odland would leave a pretty good thing for a seemingly sideways move to another retailer that isn't exactly akin to taking over for Nardelli or Sinegal. But ODP does offer a chance to repeat his success with Autozone with the Eddie Lampert disciple asterisk in the records, and of course a relocation from Memphis to Delray Beach.

What It’s Worth

AutoZone earned $540 million last year after subtracting one-time warranty benefits. In the first half of this year, it was roughly $23mm ahead of last year’s pace. Given the rough start to Q3, but the easier comparisons in the large Q4, I think it will probably earn somewhere in the neighborhood of $580mm this year. While this equates to $7.30 to $7.50 in EPS depending on the amount and timing of repurchases, it might be easier to take the Treasury Method out of the equation. At $580mm in net income plus $110mm in depreciation and $40mm from working capital reversion, AZO would have OCF of $650mm for the year, less $200mm for Capex. (Maintenance cap ex that isn’t expensed, incidentally, only runs $30mm-$40mm a year versus $110mm in depreciation.) That leaves $450m to repurchase stock, which will essentially all come in Q3 and Q4. If we assume that AZO repurchases 5 million shares during the fiscal year, they would end August with roughly 75 million basic shares outstanding. Thus, sitting in August trailing earning per existing share would be roughly $7.75. In FY06, AutoZone again expects to again grow square footage by 6%, and of course will have easier sales comparisons. If they can grow net income by 8%, to $630mm, forward earnings ending Aug06 would be $8.40 (using Aug 05 share-count). The current price is less than 10X that number. Even if AutoZone did suffer a 300 bp permanent hit to operating margins in a fairly bad case scenaior, AZO’s current price would only be a bit over 12X FY06 adjusted earnings (again, using August 05 sharecount).

AutoZone is earning greater than 25% after-tax (un-levered) returns on its new stores. They believe, based on their site selection analysis, they can open more than two thousand new stores in the United States alone, which would account for ten more years of the current 6% square footage growth rate. You can run your own numbers on what a business with a reliable earnings history, 6% top line growth and 25-30% un-levered incremental returns on capital is worth, but it’s not 10 or 11 times earnings. I think 15-16X earnings is much more the ballpark. Moderate growth at excellent returns on capital is worth a lot. And this excludes any value-based benefits from opportunistic share purchases, excess depreciation, continued margin improvements that management expects or a significant pickup in the commercial business.

Speaking of the Commercial business, I have omitted a discussion of AZO’s DIFM business (around 13% of sales), which has been struggling both absolutely and relative to competitors in recent quarters. This isn’t for lack of caring, but is a rare whim of mercy and brevity…and because I think the company is cheap without respect to whether they ultimately right their commercial woes. I would be happy to discuss the DIFM business in the follow up thread.
Catalyst
AutoZone uses its free cash to repurchase shares, so if this company is in fact cheap, the value will accrue to shareholders soon enough. Beginning the fourth quarter, AutoZone laps the biggest gas price increases and the steepest slope thus far in its comp declines. Of course, gas prices aren’t exactly showing signs of easing, and you could shy away from this business for that reason alone. While constantly increasing gas price will obviously be bad for all businesses targeting lower income consumers, it will be worse for the aftermarket shops. What happens if gas prices simply plateau at a high level is an open question, though European and Canadian consumer behavior indicates that related consumption likewise tends to stabilize.",19.455920554964816,-1.5059484077228675,16.322568665480407,32.3293708167585,6.50279868961844,3.7878011694431764,11.562160322020155,18.82964139117267

Summary
We believe Alibaba represents an attractive long from current levels.  We believe headline earnings figures understate the profitability of the core Alibaba China ecommerce model and ignore the value of such large assets as Alibaba Cloud (~$50 billion of estimated value) and Ant Financial ($50 billion value, based on last financing). If we apply a 20x to 25x multiple to forward C21 estimated EBIT at the end of C20, we arrive at a relatively large target EV range of $584 billion to $729 billion.  Adding a conservative valuation of $50 billion for all off balance sheet assets and investments yields a target equity market cap of $634 to $779 billion or $242 to $298 per share.  This represents an IRR of 17% to 30% from current levels.    
  We see a few potential catalysts that could contribute to a re-rating in the stock:
  Reacceleration in growth of customer management revenue, driven by monetization of new recommendation feed
Easing earnings comparisons as company cycles against operating losses of non-core assets / potential for operating losses to peak over the next 12 months
Improved visibility on the value of Alibaba Cloud and Ant Financial  
Short-term resolution of the trade dispute and further stabilization of the Chinese economy
  After a year of analysts continually lowering estimates ahead of the quarter, Alibaba management elected to not revise guidance for the March quarter during its January conference call, an encouraging development in our view.  As we discuss in more detail below, we believe customer management revenue, which accounts for over 60% of China commerce revenue and 40% of overall revenue, has the potential to surprise in coming quarters, suggesting potential upside to earnings, which could help drive a re-rating in the stock.  This would represent a major change in the investment narrative. 
  In addition, current financials reflect an exceptionally high level of investment spending that is concealing the underlying profitability of Alibaba’s marketplace platform.  In the F3Q:19 (December) quarter, Alibaba operating income (adjusting for intangible amortization) totaled RMB 29.6 billion (US$4.3 billion). However, online food delivery, Lazada, Cainao, cloud, content, and other/innovation businesses generated RMB16.1 billion (US$2.3 billion) of operating losses during the December quarter alone.  In fact, the company reported a commerce marketplace adjusted EBITA (excluding stock comp, etc.) of RMB 54.3 billion.  While not apples-to-apples (since this figure ignores stock comp), it serves to highlight the drag that this investment spending is having on current reported results.  We estimate that annualized operating losses on these businesses currently amount to roughly $6.5 billion. Capitalizing this figure at any multiple represents a meaningful drag on value. 
  As we have seen over time with Amazon over the years, during periods of investment spending / margin compression, the market has tended to take a less constructive outlook on valuation.  Of course, the emergence of AWS over the past 5 years, has permanently improved the AMZN story. A similar opportunity exists with Alibaba. 
  The combination of exploding investment spending along with a weakening Chinese macroeconomic environment and an ongoing China/US trade war have been a losing formula over the past 6-9 months.  Of course, if there are signs that investment spending is peaking and customer management revenue is inflecting, investors could become much more constructive on Alibaba shares. Improved Chinese macro and scaling of the cloud business could be meaningful catalysts as well. 
  Customer Management Revenue - A Potential Inflection?
After a period of steadily decelerating growth in customer management revenue, driven by tough comps, competitive pressures and weakening macroeconomic environment, we believe growth in customer management revenue (advertising revenue associated with Taobao and Tmall) has likely bottomed and is poised for potential upside in coming quarters.  Given the exceptionally high profitability of Alibaba’s core commerce segment (60%+ EBIT margins), the flow-through impact to earnings should be noticeable.
  To be clear, we are not making a call on BABA’s GMV growth accelerating.  Tmall physical goods year-over-year GMV growth was 30% and 29%, respectively, in the September and December.  These numbers are solid. We have no visibility on March quarter GMV growth. 
Customer management revenue growth has decelerated significantly since the end of calendar 2017.  This past year, BABA has been up against tough comps as customer management revenue enjoyed 2 years of exceptional growth in F17 and F18 of 48% and 48% respectively.  Said another way, customer management revenue grew by 118% over the two year period F2016 - F2018. During F17 and F18, BABA benefited from increased paid click growth, algorithm optimization and content page personalization.  
After a period of steadily decelerating growth in customer management revenue, driven by a combination of the tough comps, competitive pressures and weakening macroeconomic environment, we believe customer management revenue growth has likely bottomed and is poised for potential upside surprises.

  What is customer management revenue?
Customer management revenue is principally composed of pay for performance (P4P) marketing services (similar to Google ad words), whereby advertisers/ merchants bid for keywords that match service or product listings.  Customer management revenue also includes display marketing services, where merchants bid for display positions at fixed prices or prices established by a market-based bidding system on a cost-per-thousand impression, or CPM, basis.
  Alibaba is constantly working on ways to improve the Taobao user interface and recommendation feed.  The company has been working on version 2.0 of its personalized feed and introduced the new Taobao app during the September quarter.  The company’s vision for personalized shopping is to leverage all of the data that Alibaba has about its each user to show a shopper products that they haven’t searched for before, purchased before and even thought of previously.  Alibaba has developed a total of 100,000 targeted themes backed by 300 million products and services for its new Taobao feeds. 
  Alibaba is focused on segmenting the indivdual shopper experience based on the shopper’s previous behavior and their experience level - new, experienced and advanced users.

(1) The company has added a row of recommended search phrases; (2) There is a section with customizable favorite verticals; (3) The new app contains a section of segmented/personalized items based on user behavior on the front page; previously, it would take 4 scrolls to get to the recommended products section; and (4) product images are bigger, resulting in a better user discovery experience.
  The changes that Taobao have made are reminiscent of the ongoing tweeks that Google has been making to search for 10+ years - i.e.  Expanded text ads or Product Listing Ads.
  Timing of impact on revenue
Alibaba has been careful to not turn on proper monetization of the feed until it is confident that the feed is providing the appropriate user experience and an enhanced ROI for merchants.  We are optimistic that the new recommendation feed could provide a meaningful boost to revenue in coming quarters. For illustrative purposes, if customer management revenue were to see a 500 basis point lift in revenue, we could see $1 billion lift to operating income.
  Cloud business
Alibaba Cloud has grown to RMB 25 billion in F19E (march) and is expected to reach RMB 65 billion ($9.7 billion) of revenue by F2021 (Calendar 2020). We expect material profitability in calendar 2020. Alibaba has roughly 50% of the cloud market in China and dominates the cloud market for high tech companies, where it belives it has 80% market shares.  At 5x revenue, Alibaba Cloud could be worth $49 billion at the end of the year. 
  Other assets.
Alibaba has a large number of private and public holdings including: Ant Financial, Weibo, PayTM in India, among many others.  For simplicity and conservatism, we value all of these assets cumulatively at the last valuation round of Ant Financial, which valued Alibaba’s stake in that asset at $50 billion.
  Thoughts on valuation
Alibaba’s operating income for F2019 (March) is estimated at RMB 60.6 billion.  To this figure, we add intangible amortization of RMB 9.065 billion. This year, we estimate that Alibaba stock comp totaled RMB 38 billion, compared with RMB 16 billion and RMB 20 billion in F2017 and F2018, respectively.  We have added back RMB 10 billion to operating income, assuming the company returns to a somewhat more judicious path with respect to stock option grants going forward. This implies F2019 base year operating income of RMB 80 billion or $11.7 billion (based on 6.75 exchange rate).  We believe operating income can grow at 30% a year over the next three years, suggesting that operating income can reach $26 billion in C2021. If we further assume, that operating losses on online food delivery, Lazada, Cainao, cloud, content, and other/innovation halve over this time period to $US3.25 billion, operating income could total $29 billion in C21 (F22).  As an aside, we believe that cloud alone, could be doing over $2 billion of EBITDA in 2021.
  If we apply a 20x to 25x multiple to EBIT at the end of C20, we arrive at a target EV $584 billion to $729 billion.  Adding a conservative valuation of $50 billion for all off balance sheet assets and investments yields a target equity market cap of $634 to $779 billion or $242 to $298 per share.  This represents an IRR of 17% to 30% from current levels.

Shares of Civeo are worth at least 2x where they are currently trading without any heroic assumptions.   
I read something on Twitter that said the best ideas were concise and easy to understand ideas.  So I’m going to keep this short and sweet.  
Civeo (NYSE: CVEO) is a provider of remote workforce accommodations in Canada and Australia, with approximately 50/50 EBITDA split over the medium term.  You may know them as mancamps.  The Canadian operations primarily serve the oil sands and the Aussie business primarily serves metallurgical coal and iron ore mines.  There is very little greenfield or expansionary capex being spent in these markets so most of the activity in these areas are maintenance / turnaround related.  COVID and the crash in oil prices kind of threw the oil sands for a loop, but occupancy is picking up and should continue to recover as operations in Canada return to normal in 2021-2022, supported by much higher oil prices and return to normal staffing levels as COVID concerns go away.   
Management expects EBITDA for 2021 (excluding some beneficial one-time items) to be around $90-$100mm, so let’s just say $95mm for 2021 (management is pretty consevative with guidance, for what it’s worth).  Take off $20mm for net expected capex, $15mm of interest expense, and minimal cash taxes and they should be able to generate approximately $60mm of free cash flow in 2021 (they guided to $50-$65mm).  The business results, in general, since they are maintenance oriented, seem sustainable to me over the medium term. I model $110mm of EBITDA in 2021 as occupancy in Canada continues to recover to pre-COVID levels but that estimate could be conservative. The company has been squarely focusd on reducing debt over the past year and a half and they have commented publicly that they will consider buybacks in the seond half.  I think the shares could double over the next year as a base case.  (see analysis below)
  This stock is just an illiquid small cap that no one cares about.   If you’re interested, call up the CEO, Bradley Dodson.  He’s impressive and he loves to talk to new investors.

LONG Supervalu (SVU)
Stock Price: $4.20
Market Cap: $900 mm
Average Daily Value Traded: $15-$20 mm
  Thesis
  Supervalu is finally a super value; it is a levered special situation equity trading at 6x EBITDA and 3.5x FCF with a new owner and management team (Cerberus). We believe the new SVU has stable and growing EBITDA which means that the equity is too cheap on current numbers and could be a multi-bagger if Cerberus is successful.
  We believe SVU will begin to re-rate as the company begins executing on the business plan and the numbers become more transparent. Given the financial leverage the opportunity for the equity is significant; once the market believes in the new management team and the forward projections we SVU will trade to at least 6.5x EBITDA on CY 2014 estimates. Including the 2013 FCF generation, this results in a target price of $7.75 or 85% ups from here.
  Business Description
  SVU historically was a small grocery chain and a wholesale distribution business to independent grocers. In 2006 SVU levered up to buy the majority of Albertsons. Since 2006, SVU has struggled to run these new stores competitively as their balance sheet prevented them from being competitive on price. The declining market share, profitability, and balance sheet issues came to a head in H2 12 when SVU announced a massive guide down on 2012, fired the CEO, and announced they were pursuing strategic alternatives.
  In January 2013 SVU announced they were selling the Albertsons stores to Cerberus for $100 mm and the incurrence of the existing debt at the Alberstons entity level. Coincident with that transaction, Cerberus will invest $250 mm through a tender offer for 30% of SVU’s stock. Cerberus is putting in Bob Miller as Chairman of SVU and Sam Duncan as CEO.
  The new SVU will be three separate businesses of ~equal profitability contribution: the legacy SVU grocery banners pre-Albertsons, the whole distribution business, and their hard-discount concept Sav-A-Lot. PF FY13 (ending 2/28) EBITDA is $752 mm, and projections for FY14 and FY15 call for EBITDA of $794 mm and $825 mm respectively. This growth in EBITDA comes primarily from cost cutting at the corporate level following a de-centralization of the business model. Management is not expecting anything heroic on the top line, but they are assuming revenue is stable from here.
  The remaining grocery banners have had stable SSS and growing EBITDA for the past 3 years. The distribution business has had weak trends in the last few quarters but we believe this is due to the uncertainty about SVU’s future which resulted in management not passing through cost inflation through price increases which squeezed margins. This should be an easy fix with the removal of business uncertainty at SVU. Sav-A-Lot has also had weak trends recently and this will be more of a work in progress as past management allowed pricing to become ~300-400 bps uncompetitive so price re-investment is needed amongst other changes. Importantly, it is the company-owned stores that are underperforming; the franchise locations continue to execute, leading us to give new management the benefit of the doubt on fixing the issue vs. concerns that it is a more structural issue. In addition, SAL is in the right part of the grocery industry (hard discount) and is the biggest growth opportunity for SVU in the medium term.
  Reason for Mispricing
  There are a myriad of reasons for why SVU is mispriced: 1) The stock is down 70% in the last 2 years and has smoked any value investor buying into the cheap FCF multiple  2) the sell side has abandoned coverage of the stock given the poor experience they had with the company for the last 3 years, and the deminimus market cap today  3) SVU has morphed from primarily a grocer to a hodge podge of 3 different businesses  4) the financials are complex with the Alberstons transaction, the primary source of relevant financial data comes from a lender presentation with PF segment results and the tender off document with projections for the next three years  5) there is uncertainty over the stock technicals with the Cerberus tender offer currently outstanding (expires March 20th).
  Valuation
  At $4.20/share, the market cap is $900 mm. PF for the Albertsons transaction and debt refinanging, net debt is $2.9 b. There is $1.6 b of corporate and multi-employer pension that we tax-affect to arrive at a total enterprise value of $4.9 b. This is 6.1x CY13 EBITDA based on company projections.
  There is a misperception right now that FCF is $175 mm for CY13 based on comments from the CFO on the conference call discussing the Cerberus transactions. Management has since clarified their assumptions, and using the correct information we believe actual FCF is closer to $275 mm or $1.25/share. This implies SVU is currently trading 3.4x FCF. Companies that are stable/growing won’t stay at this low a multiple of FCF for long.
  Based on market multiples for the three segments we think the right blended EBITDA multiple for the business is 6.5x which is a $5.50 target price on CY13 and $7.75 stock price on CY14 (including $1.25 of FCF in 2013). Note that underlying FCF easily supports these equity valuations.
  Management
  Management is an important element to our thesis. Cerberus is installing Bob Miller as Chairman and Sam Duncan as CEO. Bob Miller is CEO of Albertsons LLC (ABS) which has been a homerun investment for the Cerberus.  ABS bought the Albertsons stores that SVU didn’t want in the original 2006 buyout and was able to stabilize SSS and grow EBITDA while monetizing real estate of select stores. The original ABS investors are rumored to have received a 4x return on their initial investment. Bob Miller believes he can run a similar playbook at SVU and has drafted his former lieutenant Sam Duncan out of retirement to execute the plan. While Duncan is not a Jim Collins built-to-last kind of CEO, he has been successful at cutting costs at Shopko and OfficeMax which is the necessary skillset at SVU today. Given the track records of Cerberus, Miller, and Duncan, we are willing to give them the benefit of the doubt in executing the restructuring of SVU to drive EBITDA higher.
  Catalysts
  Closing of the Cerberus tender offer.
Management engagement with the buy side and sell side to communicate the new story.
Several quarters of new financials published PF for the Albertsons transaction that shows a path to ~$800 mm of EBITDA for CY13 and growth in 2014.
Potential asset sales – SVU has a large (size is still undisclosed) capital loss carry forward that will allow them to sell their business segments in a tax-efficient manner. We know from the strategic review process that KKR and others were interested in acquiring Sav-A-Lot and we know that C&S was interested in acquiring the distribution business. We think that ultimately Cerberus will look to spruce up the profitability of the company and then sell off the businesses to maximize value to shareholders.
  Risks
  We are relying heavily on the PF disclosures and management’s projections and commentary. They could be wrong. If EBITDA is lower than $750 mm and looks set to decline the stock will go down.
  In this downside scenario it’s important to note that SVU’s new debt structure has zero financial covenants and no maturities until May 2016. At a minimum SVU has 3 years to execute the business plan.

2012-01-13,devo791,AWI,Advent Wireless Inc.,https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/Advent_Wireless_Inc./0349992225,11000000.0,0.95,"Description
Advent Wireless is an authorized dealer of wireless and wireline communications products of Rogers Communications, the largest such telecommunications provider in Canada.  AWI has a niche-focus on Asian neighbourhoods with 19 stores and kiosks in the Greater Toronto Area and 5 in Vancouver.  What makes Advent so remarkable is that it trades for less than cash despite having an operating business that is very profitable and has been consistently so for many years.  For a share price of $0.95 you get a business with $0.96 in cash at year-end and TTM EPS of $0.14.  At a valuation of only 11x trough earnings plus cash the company is worth over $2.00, which represents substantial upside from the current $0.95 level.  Furthermore, there should be significant downside protection with $0.96 in cash and management’s track record of not doing anything wasteful with it.

Advent operates under the trade names of Am-Call Wireless and Star Wireless, but as an exclusive dealer the stores are all heavily branded with either Rogers or Fido (Fido is Rogers’ discount brand).  Rogers is the largest wireless provider in Canada with over 9 M subs (7 M under the Rogers brand, 2 M under Fido).  Three companies essentially own the wireless market in Canada, with the other two being Bell and Telus, each with 7 M subs.  AWI generates revenues from: 1) the sale of phones and related accessories and 2) various bonuses and commissions tied to voice and data plan activations, upgrades, volume targets, CSAT scores, cable transactions (internet, TV, home phone), and monthly residuals for customers AWI initiates.  Around 64% of revenues are from Rogers and the current contract with them runs until May 2014.

Highlighting a few points important to the thesis:

1) The business has historically been very consistent, and has not had the margin/earnings volatility seen in other retailers.  Revenues have grown from $16.5 M in 2005 to $25.8 M in the TTM.  Over that period, operating margins have ranged from 8.1% to 13.0%, but for the vast majority of the time have been in a fairly tight band of 9 - 11%.  This stability is a function of a number of factors: low inventories (inventory turnover of 15-30x), no fashion risk in that inventory, certain recurring commission revenues (monthly residuals), and products with consistent demand (wireless products/services for the leading national carrier with 35% market share).

2) Margins are currently at the bottom end of their historical range, minimizing the likelihood of further erosion and representing a source of future growth; TTM EBITA margins are only 8.4%.  Rogers reduced commissions on renewals starting in Q2 2011 (while increasing commissions on new activations), so I have actually based my valuation off of where I think earnings will be after Q1 2012, once the commission reduction anniversaries.  As a result, I am assuming only 6.3% operating margins, which is clearly well below the historical range.  While a valuation target of 11x earnings at trough margins certainly doesn’t embed much future margin expansion, I think it’s likely that the company gradually gets back into its historical margin range, which is over 50% higher.

3) There should be EBITA margin expansion over the next few years from the 6.3% level I have modelled.  A number of factors have conspired over the past year to drive margins to this trough level, many of which should arguably moderate.  As mentioned above, a major contributor has been the reduction in commissions for renewal transactions by Rogers.  Because this happened so recently, the dealer base hasn’t had much time to adjust yet.  I think it’s likely that this squeeze by Rogers will result in the closure of some of the weaker dealer outlets, which obviously benefits all remaining dealers.  Advent themselves responded to this action by recently consolidating their two stores in Toronto’s Chinatown into a single location (they were < 5 mins apart walking distance); this specific action should also benefit AWI’s margins going forward.

Also, the wireless market in Canada became more competitive with the entrance of three new carriers in AWI’s markets (WIND, Moblicity, and Public Mobile).  Before market entry, the Canadian wireless industry was already a strong oligopoly of 3 carriers (Rogers, Bell, and Telus), each with a dual brand strategy for segmentation.  Considering the significant scale advantages of the incumbents, I think it’s highly likely that all of the new entrants eventually fail and pull out of the Canadian market.  While it’s tough to quantify the impact these companies have had on AWI’s operations to date, the marketing blitz of 3 companies simultaneously trying to establish their own wireless brands in Canada -- and generally with the lure of aggressive pricing -- has certainly not helped Rogers and its dealers.

Finally, 2010 benefited from the launch of the iPhone 4, without a similar event in 2011.  The iPhone 4S should benefit Q4 2011, which hasn’t been reported yet, but clearly not to the same extent.  With an iPhone 5 likely slated for 2012, this should also contribute to improved results in the latter half of 2012 over 2011.

4) The company has historically grown revenues at a 7-8% annual rate, and I think they should be able to continue growing revenues at a 5%+ rate going forward.  The wireless market in Canada is still growing; 45% of Rogers subscribers now use smart phones and this rate of penetration continues to climb to AWI’s benefit.  Furthermore, even in the core markets of Toronto and Vancouver there is room to expand to other locations that fit their demographic profile, particularly in the Peel and Halton regions.  The Fido operations are also fairly nascent and the company expects to add to the existing base of 6 stores.  Finally, there are two huge Asian themed malls that are expanding and AWI has already reserved 3 additional spots in them.  They will be adding a store in the second phase of Pacific Mall in Toronto and adding two stores in the second phase of Aberdeen Square.  These store openings, however, are further away and not expected until 2013-2014.

5)  The company is highly unlikely to do anything wasteful with its cash.  While it’s obvious that the company has had an excessive amount of cash on the balance sheet for many years, they have thus far resisted returning it to shareholders in any form.  While this is disappointing, the flip side of this is that they haven’t done anything stupid with it either -- they’ve simply just let it build steadily every year.  Consider this: from 2006 to today the company has had cumulative net income of $7.8 M, has not issued equity, and over that same period the net cash position has increased by $8.9 M!  And while the company hoarded its cash and got leaner on working capital they managed to grow revenues by 50%.  

Insiders own around a quarter of the company so they are clearly well incented not to do anything foolish with the company’s cash.  While I obviously hope management eventually considers a special dividend, at the moment I expect them to continue just letting the cash pile up; shareholders will realize the value of that cash when they sell the company to a larger wireless dealer like Glentel.

6) Although the company’s economics are partially dictated by the commission structure put in place by Rogers, over which they have no control, the unit economics are strong.  PP&E is modest and the stores actually have negative working capital.  As a result, the company overall has essentially no capital invested -- certainly much different than a typical retailer!

Valuation

In the trailing 12 months the company has had revenues of $25.8 M, EBITA of $2.2 M, and EPS of $0.14.  By the end of Q1 2012, after the company has anniversaried the commission reduction, I expect TTM revenues of $23.8 M, EBITA of $1.5 M and EPS of $0.09-0.10.  I think the company should be worth at least 11x this trough EPS level, which after adding the $0.96 in cash yields a share price of $2.00.

  Description
HGV was written up almost exactlyayearago by Ruby831. That writeup does a good job of going
through the fundamentals, but we think it’s time to revisit the name after its second guidance reduction
in 6 months and subsequent nosedive.
  Note: Ruby831 and others added some great color recently on the message thread to that idea, I’m not
clear on how to link the two ideas/threads but that thread definitely worth reading.
  The Business:
  First, we want to briefly go through the different business lines to clarify what generated the miss:
  Real EstateSegment: This what people may classicallythink of as “timeshare”. The company develops
inventory (either greenfield or project add-on) and then sells the units as Vacation Ownership Intervals,
essentially the right to stay at a location for a week of the year. Given the difference in pricing of various
units and the fact that inventory can’t be made instantly, it is a lumpy segment. This has since been
exacerbated by the new 606 accounting standards, which forces them to defer revenue from un-opened
properties until official launch. More about this later.
  Financing: For owned inventory development,the company will offer financing of VOI sales.Typically,
65% of owners finance on 10-year paper. The average FICO is over 700, and the company does an ABS
sale once a year, monetizing at a 10% spread. While this is large, they are the only ones who can finance
their own sales (banks wont do it) and the paper has performed well over a very long time. The only
time the ABS market was frozen was briefly in the financial crisis.
  Resort and Club Management: Given you are buying physical property, you need to spend to maintain
this. HGV collects various fees, though many are simply passed through as actual maintenance or fund
reserves. This comes through at a very high margin, is very stable, and has been growing. Very similar to
Hotel C-corp fees.
  Rental and Ancillary: the company rents out unused units as a hotel,as well as operates F&B in the
resorts. This is effectively like a running an actual hotel,as many guests are simply HHonors members.
  When you break down EBITDA,roughly 2/3rds ofit is highly sticky or recurring fee streams, while the
remaining 1/3 is volatile,based on in-year sales (though they have a very good track record over the
long-term). The balance of the guidance reduction was entirely due to the lumpiness of the 1/3, which is
effectively in an air pocket of higher quality inventory after finishing a prime Hawaiian property in 2018.
  What Has Changed:
  Without a doubt, this has been an epic failure in communication over the past 12 months. Management
went through an inventor day in which they didn’t hit LT guidance (new CFO has just started), then
subsequently had to lower guidance again after Q1 (conversion rates were lower than expected), and
again after Q2 (mix shift caused avg. price to be lower than expected). We know it sounds like complete
amateur hour, though we find reason to believe these thing are more “we screwed up” than “the
business is under pressure”.
  One of the biggest changes since the previous write up is the shift from asset-light to more asset-
intensive. After doing the whole dog and pony show for the past 3 years on how they aren’t taking much
building risk, they started aggressively spending capital on new development. The street, ever wary of a
capital-intensive leisure company late into a cycle, reacted poorly at best. We think it’s pretty apparent
now that management realized two things: first, they didn’t have the inventory in the pipeline to grow
like they wanted, and second, taking on financing partners stunted the longer-term economics and
networks effects running a vacation as a service company. You can speak to said financing partners
about these deals or build out a basic model as we have, but the unlevered IRR of putting capital into
the ground appears to range between high teens and low twenties. Not a shabby return and worth
doing on your own/controlled balance sheet.
  The second big change is that management got wise on capital allocation.With an effectively unlevered
balance sheet, they decided to start buying back stock. People will have many opinions on this, though
at least in the short term, they were aggressively buying stock right before two guidance reductions. Not
a good look. However, on the call yesterday management appeared undaunted. They will be receiving
another ~$300mm of cash from ABS securitizations in a few weeks. While this will not go 100% to
buybacks,you could easily see them buy $150-$200mm across thecourse of the year, another 7% of the
market cap (they have already bought 9%).
  A final note is that the introduction of new accounting standards has really convoluted the reported economics.
This can be seen bright as day in that they just reduced EBITDA guidance by $60mm,but FCF guidance
by $10mm… This flows through the statements via deferrals, which are basically pre-sales on not
yet open properties. One thing to note is that they defer 100% of revenue and direct costs, but you can’t
defer indirect costs,so deferrals look likethey have 50%+margin.This is why margins looked so low
Thursday. The reversal then comes through at a similarly high margin. This is all to
say that the lumpiness has been made larger, but as investors, we need to adjust for that in our modeling/
valuation.
  What HAS NOT Changed:
  Conversion/macro: The way this company builds to revenue is tours * conversion rate* average price
per unit. This conversion rate has oscillated between 13% and 17% for the past 30 years. In 2016 and
2017 that rate was in the mid 14%s. In 2018 that rate was just under 16%. For 1H2019 that rate whas in
the mid 14%s again. For all the hubbub regarding a potential slowdown in the macro,conversion is still
in its healthy range, albeit down from near the peak last year. They still grew net owners by over 6%
(literally new people into the platform). In places where they launched new product, we saw growth
well into the double digits. Far be it from us to call cycles, but this doesn’t feel like a material slowdown
in outside forces.
  Pricing: Management did a poor job explaining the concept of “VPG” or Volume per Guest on the call.
This metric is effectively total contract sales / tours. It was down >5% in Q2, and management kept
saying that they had seen “reduced pricing”. What they did NOT do is reduce price. They had a mix shift
problem. By not having premium inventory,they were selling more lower priced units. Its not like they
were reducing price to stoke demand.
  The“stable”fee streams: These pretty much all beat, and are still growing in the HSD+range
  The long-term algorithm: We do think it’s likely that management modestly adjusts their long-term
guidance. Specifically, they have a credibility problem and a new CFO who didn’t bless the previous
numbers. However, mechanically the long-term numbers shouldn’t really change. To again break the
business into recurring vs. RE sales: the recurring should go down modestly because they are selling less
this year, which will have a knock-on effect to the following years. But given this years contribution to
the total member base is ~6% and that number is coming in ~5% light, it really doesn’t move the needle
that much. The 1/3 that is real estate in-year has basically no relationship to the earnings of that
segment the year prior. They have a set amount of inventory coming online and a conversion rate at
which they sell that inventory.When they launch new projects in 2020, the fact that they missed in 2019
shouldn’t influence their ability to sell the new stuff. So while everyone across the street is taking down
numbers, we believe it more to be out of blind conservatism than hard logic in the model.
  So where do they go from here? We’ve (finally) had what feels like a kitchen sink clearing event in
guidance, with extremely strong product launches coming in the next two years and some interesting catalysts.
  1) Management is going to be buying a boatload of stock back at now pretty depressed prices. 2) Let’s be
honest, this is a lumpy business and the space has a long history of financial sponsors, so it probably has
some buyers circling around it. 3) management is finally talking about a “points-based” product which
would smooth volatility (new COO was old President ofRCI and knows trust-products well).
  From a valuation perspective, you are about 9x 2020 EPS, with 2/3 of the business growing DD and 1/3
about to have a huge rebound from new product over the next two years. It bottomed out in December
at 6x EBITDA,which would put it in the neighborhood of a low $20s downside. If it works and the sell
through is as good as a we/they think it will be over the next 2-3 years, they will be doing well over $4.00 of EPS,
which we think should trade at a low to mid-teens P/E, so a high-$40s to mid-$50s upside.
   I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

Investment Thesis
Pure Cycle - long term, major upside, modest downside. The business has two kinds of segments: water rights and land to be developed. Segments are independent of one another, yet the land will accelerate water income. Each segment alones justifies the current valuation. 
  Business Segments
Land - Sky Ranch
The business owns ~930 acres in the east Denver metropolitan area. They bought it after the financial crisis for $7.5m. PCYO already had water rights in the area, which they wanted to begin selling. PCYO bought the land in 2010, which was bought earlier for about $50m. The company is developing a community of 3,200 homes and 2m SQFT of commercial, retail, and light industrial development. The whole project will take about 10 years to develop.
  Currently, there are more than 120 residents in the neighborhood, up from 70 in the 1st Q. 
  The first phase is running and will have 506 single-family residential homes with a low-entry price range ($325k). PCYO has three agreements with different developers: Richmond American, Taylor Morrison, and KB Homes. By Nov 3rd 2020, PCYO completed and delivered all of the 506 lots to the homebuilders (up from 277 at the end of last year), as they expected last year that they will. The home builders already sold 365 homes (up from 100 12 months ago) - 2 years ahead of schedule. They believe that the 140 homes remaining will be sold in 2021.
  The overall construction costs of the first phase were $36m (/506=$71K per lot). Lot sales were about the same ($71K per lot, breaking even), but in addition, the company got $13.7m in tap fees (which will be later discussed) and $10.5m of reimbursable, that will grow to $29m total (also - to be discussed). 
  In his last letter to shareholders (Dec 1st), Mark Harding, CEO and President, said that the company is on track to launch the development of the second phase of Sky Ranch this month (Dec 2020). It is 250 acres of residential development (1st phase is 150) and 160 acres of commercial, retail, and light-industrial development. The company “entered into contracts with four home builders to sell 789 finished lots, on which the home builders will construct both attached and detached single-family residential units”. The company keeps 100 for itself for future purposes. The total sales for the 789 lots are $63.4m (the other 100 worth around $9-10m).
  For this stage, the company is expected to spend $66m on development, with lot sales of $73m, reimbursements of $48m and tap fees of $21m - which leaves us with profits of ~$75m. 
  The third phase will be 300 acres big and we heard less about it from the management, therefore I will leave it to further discussions. 
  Here I would like to mention that I like the development rate here. In some businesses, we would like to see rapid expansion. In others, we would like to see more moderate actions - that will
a. Bare less debt, and 
b. Will not burn land inventories too quickly, and allow price changes to positively influence the business.
Following PCYO for the past 2-3 years, I can definitely say that they took the second approach. The debt burden is very low and they smartly divided the project into 3 phases for more than a decade of work. 
  Sky Ranch - Unit Economic. Two kinds of revenue streams: (1) sold lots (2) tap fees (measured by SFEs: single-family equivalent, 1 water tap per 1 customer). 
  Non-Recurring Revenues
1. Lot Sale - in the first phase, PCYO charged around $70,000 from the developers for a developed lot, and currently, in the 2nd stage, they charge about $80,000.
  2. Public Improvements - PCYO is investing in public facilities and utilities in the neighbourhood. PCYO is expected to get reimbursement of $29m for these expenses from the municipal district when it raises bonds in the future, for the first phase alone (and it already got 10.5).
  A little bit of math. PCYO invested in the first phase $36 (up 1m from expectations), including utility investments of $29m improvements to be reimbursed. Lot sales provided a near amount. So that’s breaking even. But the company also gets $29m reimbursements (±$49k). I will consider it as $50k from now on. 
  Ⅲ Water & Sewer Taps - the company is also the provider of water and waste management serviced for the revenue. The company charges $4,752 (up from $4,600 last year) for a sewer tap and $27,209 (up from $26,500 last year) for a water tap, and they estimate they will have around taps (SFEs). In the Q2 2018 call the CEO said that those have a 50% margin, so that’s ~$16,000 per SFE (let’s say $15,000). [BTW - Margins are probably higher now, as they raised prices]
  The company says it will sell 3,200 residential lots. 15k (taps) + 50k (lot) = ±$65k per lot, which is ±$208 in NOI for the total lot sales. 
  In addition, the company has 2m SQFT commercially zoned land. Unlike residential land that is sold per lot, I wasn’t able to find the numbers for the 160 acres development costs nor potential revenue, so I will not consider that. Part of the commercial land will be developed in the 2nd stage and part of it in the third. The commercial area will also have about 1,600 SFEs, so that’s another ±$24m in NOI. 
So the total NOI of Sky Ranch is about $230m (rounding down with a few discounts, not including the sale of commercial land).
  Recurring Revenue
The company will sell water and waste management for the Sky Ranch neighborhood in the future. PCYO says that they will get around $1,500 a year from each of its 5,000 SFEs (Q4 2019 call). That’s about $7.5m a year of water biz - that should get a high multiple in the future. 
  Water and Wastewater (In addition to Sky Ranch)
In 1996 the company bought its water rights in the area of Lowry, Denver (Rangeview). The Lowry Range water rights are about 27,000 acres in size (the company also has 2,200 acres in different areas I will not focus on due to their small meaning to the business currently). Later, in 1997, they went into an agreement with the Rangeview district to provide wastewater service in the Lowry Range.
  Pure cycle believes that in potential there will be around 60,000 SFEs (1 SFE = 1 customer), not including Sky Ranch. Besides Sky Ranch, PCYO already supplies water for 649 (up from 462) SFEs and 384 (up from 214) wastewater SFEs - it’s not meaningful, but the trend is there (Table 1). 
  The unit economy here is the same as in Sky Ranch: initial $4,752 for wastewater, $27,209 for water, and $1,500/customer/year. 
  THEORETICALLY, PCYO sits on a gold-mine-in-potential of $1.8b in initial installment ($0.9b gross) and another 90m in yearly revenues. We need to be cautious about it. This area is undeveloped and the growth of sales here is VERY low (although we saw a recent rise), as one can see in Table 1. So, again, that's only a potential.
  Table 1
Year 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016
Water 649         462         391         391         258
Waste 384         214         157         157         157
  Water / Oil Fracking
Near PCYO’s water supply system, there are some fracking operations. Harding mentioned 16,000 wells used in a single time and that each well is worth around $150k (potentially $2.4b) for PCYO. Each well equals 200 homes in its water consumption per year. Currently there are about 100 wells (<1%). So, if oi prices rise, and fracking in the area are not forbidden, we could see a nice potential here as well. But - a reminder - that’s not the end goal here. That’s only a method to spend time & earn money while the city develops.
  Other things to take in mind
1. Water Demand - Water demand will only go up while the supply will remain about the same. 
2. Inflation -  Therefore no need to discount inflation because they will also raise prices (as they did this year)
3. Other Businesses - The company has other businesses that could create some revenues in the future, like oil royalties (creates $150k a year per well, currently only one well), some mineral rights that could one day be worth something.
4. Debt - 0.
5. The company also gets royalties from O&G explorations in it’s properties (650K in 2020).
  Valuation
PCYO doesn’t need to get 60,000 customers or to frack 16,000 wells in order to be worth more than it is today. 
  The company trades for $245m. The market evaluates it with a small premium to Sky Ranch. PCYO will probably have a net income of about $150-200m from Sky ranch, and one should add a high multiple on the $7.5m to the recurring water sales (peer comparison shows a min of x5 EV/revenue of sales, an average of x8). 
  So for a few tens of millions of dollars, you get this great water system, ready to deliver water to newly developed neighborhoods in east Denver. And until that happens, as long as oil is around $40-50, it can sell its water for fracking. And it has zero debt and many catalysts. So, I guess that we are OK where we’re at. 
  Risks
1. Management can’t return value to shareholders - Since we have no experience with the return of value, we can’t be sure how done it will be made. 
2. Sky Ranch's next phases might take some time to take off if any crisis hits. The company has no debt so it's not a major problem, rather a delay. It will have great influence in the short term, but long term inherent value will remain the same.
3. Management raises debt for projects it will find it hard to monetize down the road.
  4. Red Flag - Harding (CEO and President) only owns ~2% of the company and sold some stock earlier in the year.
 I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise do not hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

Summary: Limoneira (LMNR) is an agribusiness concern with significant ownership of land and water rights, mostly in California. The company is coming off a terrible 2019 in which its lemons and oranges suffered low prices and it experienced a crop failure in avocados. Lemon pricing, though, is now improving, which should have an immediate impact on LMNR’s profitability. Moreover, LMNR will begin to generate revenue from its housing project and new production coming online in the next two years. I think there is potential upside of 40% to about $30/share over the next year. 
Profile: Limoneira (which means “lemon lands” in Portuguese) is an agribusiness concern based in Ventura County in southern California which traces its history back to 1893. LMNR manages 15,700 acres of land on which it grows lemons, avocados, oranges, and other crops. LMNR is one of the largest lemon producers in the U.S. and the crop generates most of its revenue and income. LMNR also manages packing operations and is part of a joint venture to develop single-family homes on its land. LMNR produces and processes crops in California, Arizona, Chile, and Argentina.
Background
Limoneira traces its history to 1893, although it has expanded greatly in just the past 10 years. LMNR rather reluctantly, completed an IPO in 2010 after it surpassed 500 shareholders. At the time, a firm with 500 shareholders was required to file financials with the SEC. Soon after the IPO, Limoneira left the Sunkist cooperative in which it had been a member for more than 100 years, requiring the firm to do its own sales and marketing for the first time ever. In its first few years as a public company, some investors were attracted to LMNR as an investment due to its ownership of California land and water rights, potentially worth much more than the EV of the business. Over time, however, it became apparent that monetization of LMNR’s land and water was not the management’s priority and many investors lost interest. There’s more information on this topic in the prior write-up on the company on VIC by Woolly18 in 2014. I will discuss LMNR’s land assets, but my write-up will focus on its agricultural business, especially its lemon production.
Lemons
“When life gives you lemons…do not make lemonade as lemons have greater value in the fresh market.”
Limoneira is, primarily, in the business if growing lemons. In fiscal year 2019, lemons and lemon packing accounted for 87% of LMNR’s revenue. LMNR has operations in South America and grows lemons in three U.S. regions: central California (near Bakersfield), Ventura County, California (north of Los Angeles), and western Arizona (near Yuma). LMNR has greatly expanded its lemon production through a series of acquisitions, partnerships, and new plantings over the past decade. Since the IPO, LMNR’s lemon acreage has doubled while its acreage of other crops has increased just 10%. Moreover, LMNR has focused on lemons in its recent plantings. LMNR (citing USDA figures) estimates that its share of the U.S. lemon market increased to 9.5% in 2019 from 3.9% in 2011.
LMNR also has packing facilities for both its own crops and those of and third parties. In 2016, LMNR invested $26 mil. in upgrades to its 100-year old packinghouse in Santa Paula, California, which the company claims can now do three times the volume with 30% less labor. This facility is currently operating below capacity, so it will become more profitable as LMNR increases its production and brings in more third-party work. In addition, in 2018, LMNR acquired a packer called Oxnard Lemon for $25 mil. which specializes in organic lemon packing. The Oxnard deal increased LMNR’s packing capacity by about 50% (to 12 mil. cartons from 8 mil.) and generates $40-$45 mil. in additional revenue. As the facility is less than 50% utilized, it could generate as much as $100 mil. in revenue as LMNR increases production and brings in new third-party customers.
LMNR has gone international in the last few years, under a program it calls “One World of Citrus”. This program allows LMRN to serve customers in many parts of the world in all 12 months of the year. In 2014, LMNR invested in a citrus, packing, and marketing business in Chile. In 2018, it closed a $60 mil. secondary to increase its ownership in this business and to fund the acquisition and planned expansion of a citrus farm in Chile. In 2019, LMNR acquired majority control of a citrus concern in Argentina for $15 million. LMNR expects its total lemon production to increase to 8.7 mil. (3.9 mil. owned) cartons in FY20 from 7.5 mil. (3 mil. owned) cartons in FY19. Further, LMNR’s lemon production will expand by 1,200 acres over the next four years as newly planted trees mature. LMNR expects 300 of the 1,200 acres will become productive in FY21.
Limoneira has increased its exposure to lemons because of a long-term increase in demand for the fruit. Overall, LMNR has increased its lemon acreage from about 1,800 acres in 2010 to 3,500 acres today, with another 1,500 acres coming online in future years. LMNR has taken on the risk of heavily exposed to just one crop because it believes the lemon market has many years of growth ahead of it. According to LMNR (citing USDA stats), U.S. and global consumption of fresh lemon/lime grew 3.7% and 3.5%, respectively, per year between 2011 and 2019. The U.S. supply of lemons changes little from year to year as domestic lemon production is almost completely restricted to California and Arizona and it takes years for new trees to produce fruit. Imports, though, can affect pricing. Most (about 70%) fresh lemons in the U.S. are sold to the food service industry as most lemons are consumer out of the home. Lemon consumption has been rising as people consume more fresh food. About two-thirds of LMNR’s lemon production is consumed domestically. Internationally, consumption of lemons has risen as more people move into the middle class. Some key export markets for LMNR include Canada, South Korea, and Japan.
Lemons are much more valuable sold as fruit than for lemonade. Lemons are priced by the 40-lb. carton. The pricing of lemons is vastly different depending on how they are sold. Lemons (unlike, say, corn) cannot be stored indefinitely and must be sold to the fresh market in a matter of months. When they cannot be sold as fresh fruit, lemons are sold to lemonade producers at greatly reduced prices. In a normal market, a carton of fresh fruit sells for about $25, but a carton of lemons for lemonade sells for only about $3. Given the huge price disparity, LMNR, not surprisingly, wants to sell as many cartons of fresh lemons as possible before they must be dumped for juice. Prior to 2019, LMNR was selling 70%-80% of its lemons to the fresh market and its target is 75%. In 2019, however, the lemon market turned sour and LMNR had to sell lots of lemons at low prices.
A severe downturn in lemon pricing wreaked havoc on LMRN in FY19. As with any agricultural commodity, the price of lemons goes up and down depending on supply and demand. While demand for lemons in the U.S. is relatively stable, the supply can change quickly due to weather and production in a few key lemon-producing areas. In the winter of 2018-19, California experienced heavy rainfall. While this weather pattern ended a 7-year drought and was very good news for the state, it led to a bumper crop of large lemons and a severe downturn in prices. For much of FY19, the price per carton of large lemons was about $18, roughly 40%-50% below “normal”. The price per carton of small lemons (which is higher) also dropped. Moreover, the large crop of lemons forced LMNR to sell about 50% of its production into the very low-price lemonade market. LMNR’s overall average price per carton in FY19 was $21.46, down from $29.71 in FY18. This decline had a huge impact on LMNR’s earnings. The company’s adjusted EBITDA declined to just $1.9 mil. in FY19 from $23.4 mil. in FY18 despite a 32% increase in revenue. Moreover, its adjusted EPS dropped from $0.45 in FY18 to a loss of $0.50 in FY19. LMNR has said that every $1 decline in the price of a carton of lemons reduces its EBITDA by about $2 million. The good news, though, is that FY20 looks like a much better year. LMNR has projected the price per carton of large lemons to strengthen to $22.50, an increase of 25% from last year, but still relatively low. There could be upside to this number. Moreover, LMNR expects to return to selling about 75% of its lemons in the fresh market in FY20, which will boost its total pricing.
Avocadoes and Oranges
LMNR produces other crops besides lemons, notably avocados and oranges, which, respectively, produce about 5% and 7% of its product revenue. The company operates 900 acres of avocado production. As with lemons, LMNR views avocados as a growth market. The company (citing USDA stats) says that avocado consumption increased 103% in the U.S. between 2011 and 2018 due, in part, to the growing Latino population. Unfortunately, though, most of LMNR’s FY19 avocado crop was wiped out by a heat wave in Ventura Co. in the summer of 2018. The company’s avocado production dropped 70% in FY19 from FY18. The company collected a $2.3 mil. crop insurance payment related to the loss in FY19, but an expected bumper crop was ruined. LMNR’s avocado revenue fell to $5.4 mil. (including the insurance payment) in FY19 from a relatively low $6.6 mil. in FY18. For comparison, LMNR reported $9.5 mil. in avocado revenue in FY17, a good crop year. Avocado production in California tends to have alternating good and bad years. LMNR expects that FY20 will be a strong year, suggesting its FY20 avocado revenue will be a few million dollars higher than it was in FY19. As much of its costs (growing / harvesting) are fixed, this increase in sales has a significant impact on the bottom line.
LMNR mainly produces oranges as fruit rather than for the orange juice market. LMNR owns 1,600 acres of orange groves, mostly in Tulare Co., California. While most (95+%) of the oranges grown in Florida are used in juice, most of the oranges grown in California are sold as fruit. This is significant because, as with lemons, oranges produced for fruit rather than juice bring higher prices. Unfortunately, though, orange prices have been low due to soft demand. LMNR’s revenue from oranges dropped 32% in FY19 (to $6.0 mil. in FY19 from $8.9 mil. in FY18) despite a 27% increase in volume. LMNR’s average price per carton dropped by nearly half in FY19 (to $6.64 in FY19 from $12.48 in FY18). LMNR’s profitability would benefit if orange prices rebound because, as with avocados, most of its production expenses are fixed.
Land Value
One of the main attractions to LMNR as an investment is that the company owns land and water rights that are theoretically worth more than the current EV of about $500 million. As most people know, both water and land are scarce in California and worth more than gold / bitcoin. The problem for investors in LMNR is, obviously, that its land is covered in crops and its water is used to keep them from turning to dust. I have no view that LMNR intends to sell its properties piece by piece and distribute the proceeds to investors. The company only has one major non-agriculture project in the works (discussed in the next section). In fact, LMNR does make any great effort to illustrate the potential value of its land and water in its investor presentations. The company does mention, though, that it owns approximately 28,000 acre-feet of water rights, and that such rights in Ventura County have recently sold for as much as $20,000 per acre foot, up from $16,500 per square foot in 2015. So, in theory, LMNR’s water rights are valuable and rising in price even if not sold with property. There are possibilities for LMNR to monetize some of its rights since the company has said that it has more than enough water to fulfill its needs, even in a drought scenario, as the company has investments in several water suppliers. LMNR has also announced that it has a partnership with a hedge fund called Water Asset Management to market its water rights on the Colorado River. So, it’s possible that LMNR could sell some of its water if it needed or wanted some extra cash. As for the land, here’s the basic breakdown:
California: 8,700 acres of farmland (4,100 acres in Ventura Co., 3,900 acres in Tulare Co., and 700 acres in San Luis Obisbo Co.)
Yuma, AZ: 1,300 acres
Chile: 3,500 acres
Argentina: 1,200 acres
In its 10-K, LMNR lists the book value of its land at $94.0 million. It’s obvious that the actual value of this land is worth far more as many of the properties were acquired decades ago. For example, the book value of the 1,700 acres in Ventura County acquired by the company before 1920 is listed at $767,000, or just $451 per acre. I’m sure that was a fair price during World War I, but not today. Several other LMNR properties have stated book values below $10,000 per acre. While the prices of farmland in California vary greatly, farmland that includes water rights in Ventura Co. and Tulare Co. can sell for as much as $75,000 and $40,000 per acre, respectively. In the previous VIC report, Woolly estimated the fair market value of LMNR’s agricultural assets at $484 million (which would include the water rights). I don’t see why they wouldn’t be worth more than that today as the need for land and water in California has certainly increased in the past 6 years. The important point is that LMNR’s land and water alone is likely worth more than the current EV of about $500 million.
The Harvest at Limoneira
The Harvest at Limoneira is a housing development in Santa Paula, CA, on land that was once a lemon and avocado orchard operated by LMNR. This project generated excitement among investors when it was first proposed and the zoning was approved, but investor interest has waned as it became apparent that it was a solo project rather than a change in strategy. In fact, CEO Harold Edwards has divested most of LMNR’s non-agricultural properties over the past 15 years. Anyway, LMNR has partnered with Lewis Group to create and market The Harvest, a planned community with 1,500 residential units on 550 acres. In 2018, KB Home and Lennar were chosen as primary homebuilders. The partnership began to sell homes in FY19 and sold 210 homes in FY19 and an additional 33 homes in Q1 of FY20. LMNR has already received $20 mil. from the project and expects to receive another $80 mil. over the next few years. The Harvest is probably cash flow breakeven at present but should generate meaningful cash flow next year. My expectation is that LMNR receives the next installment of $20 mil. in cash in FY21 and $60 mil. in cash in the FY23-25 period. There is practically no incremental cost to LMNR from The Harvest. Based on these expectations, the NPV of The Harvest is about $45 million.
Other Real Estate
LMNR has a small reporting segment called “rental operations”, which generated 3% of its FY19 revenue. This business consists of about 260 rental units, most of which are rented to the company’s farmworkers. This business is not significant, but I suppose that provides some stability to the labor force.
LMNR has some other non-core real estate, some of which it has put up for sale. In September 2019, for example, it sold a convenience store / gas station complex for $4 million.
Other
LMNR owns 250,000 shares of publicly traded Calavo Growers (CVGW), which markets its avocados. LMNR once owned 1 mil. shares of CVGW but has been slowly reducing its position. This investment is worth about $20 mil. at the current price of CVGW and is marked-to-market at each quarter. Also, notably, Calavo owns about 9% of the outstanding shares of LMNR and LMNR’s CEO Harold Edwards serves on Calavo’s board.
LMNR pays a dividend of $0.30 / year, which it has consistently increased since ’13.
Earnings Estimates
Limoneira’s income statement has been affected by some one-time items, such as sales of CVGW shares and restructuring charges related to acquisitions. The low lemon/orange pricing and terrible avocado crop took a big toll in LMNR’s FY19 results. LMNR’s adjusted EPS fell to a loss of $0.45 in FY19 from gains of $0.50 and $0.42 in FY18 and FY17, respectively. Similarly, LMNR’s adjusted EBITDA dropped to just $1.9 mil. in FY19 from $23.5 mil. and $19.0 mil. in FY18 and FY17, respectively. I anticipate higher pricing in FY20 and FY21 and increasing supply. I expect LMNR’s revenue will be nearly twice as high in FY21 as it was in FY17. I forecast LMNR’s EPS to bounce back to $0.46 and $0.74 in FY20 and FY21, respectively, and its adjusted EBITDA to reach $24.3 mil. and $33.9 mil in FY20 and FY21, respectively.
Valuation
The current EV of LMNR is about $500 million. My estimate for FY21 adjusted EBITDA is $33.4 million. I get a valuation of $26.75 / share based on a 15x EV/EBITDA on FY21 EBITDA. Additionally, I assume $3.25 / share in income in FY21 from the Harvest at Limoneira and the sale of the remaining shares of CVGW, so my price target is $30.00.

  Risks:
Drought, fires, climate change, water, etc. Like any other farming concern, LMNR’s business is affected by the weather. As the areas in which LMNR operates (California and Arizona) do not get nearly enough rain for its crops, LMNR is dependent on underground water. LMNR would be in trouble if it lost its water rights or the water table ran dry. LMNR, in recent years, has been adversely affected by both too little and too much rain at the wrong times. Climate change / heat is also an immediate threat. In 2018, much of LMNR’s avocado crop was wiped out by extreme heat and wildfires came close to its properties in both 2017 and 2019.
Trade. The crops that LMNR produces are imported and exported in high volumes. Pricing of LMNR’s crops is based on supply and demand. Trade restrictions that prevent LMNR’s crops from being exported would hurt its business. Moreover, in recent years, pricing for its crops has been adversely affected by excess supply being exported to the U.S. Avocado production, for example, is much larger in Mexico than in California.
Acquisitions and expansion. LMNR now has significant business operations in South America, an area in which it has limited experience. There could be unexpected problems from the integration of this business.
Land value. One of the key issues for investors is the value of LMNR’s land. A large decline in property values in California due to a major recession would likely affect the value of its stock. Moreover, LMNR now has exposure to the housing market due to The Harvest at Limoneira project. While it is widely believed that California suffers from a lack of housing supply, housing prices could fall due to rising interest rates or a recession.
Labor. How many of you want to harvest or pack lemons and avocados in 100-degree heat? Zero? This may come as a shock, but many farmworkers in California and Arizona are (gasp!) not legal residents of the United States. Don’t call ICE.
  Summary: Coming off a terrible year, Limoneira appears to be a good risk/reward investment right now. Lemon pricing is improving and the comparisons with FY19 will be easy. Also, new production should add about $30 mil. in incremental revenue over the next couple of years. Yet, the stock is still about 35% below its 2018 high. I think that it will become clearer over the next few quarters that 2019 was an anomaly and that LMNR’s business is in better shape than it appears.
I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

Summary
IWG is a multi-brand operator of flexible office solutions, shared offices and co-workspaces, across value to premium concepts.
The key tenants of our favorable view of IWG include:
a. Large market with massive growth ahead (15-30% CAGR over the next 10 years)
b. Good business that earns 20% post-tax ROIC over cycles
c. Expected compounding of 35% in FCF/Share from 2021 to 2026 offered at 15-16X P/FCF of depressed earnings 
d. Strong and expanding barriers to success  
e. Extremely attractive risk-reward profile on a 3-year fwd basis:
Base case  2.6x MOI / 35% IRR
Upside case  3.4x MOI / 50% IRR
Downside case 0.8x MOI / (7%) IRR
  Massive market opportunity with COVID19 as a structural accelerator
Net takeaway: the flexible office space has been grown at an accelerating rate over the last two decades and will likely expand even faster post COVID19.  Companies are shifting from long-term fixed leases (“fixed”) into short-term office solutions consumed on a variable basis through subscription models (“flex”).  
Evidence of growth in supply:  The following summarizes our findings on the global flex office market (date sources in parenthesis):
a. In 2002 flex office made up around 0.3% of total office space in N.A and EU (Savills)
b. From 2002 to 2010 Flex grew at 10% per year, reaching 0.5% of total office space (JLL)
c. From 2010 to 2019 Flex cagr accelerated to 24% (JLL) and flex made up 2.2% of total Office space
- USA: flex made up 0.3% of total space or 9.5 msqf in 2010 and grew to 85 msqf by 2019 at 28% cagr (CBRE)
- Europe: flex expanded at a 21% cagr from 2010 to 2019 and reached 2.1% penetration (JLL) 
- Asia: flex sqf grew from 2015 to 2019 at 38% cagr (JLL, no info on penetration)
e. Globally, flex space grew at 30% cagr from 2015-2018 (JLL); Flex grew at a 35% cagr over the last five years (The Instant Group)

==> Supply of flex offices grew at ~10% during the decade ending 2010, accelerated to around 20% cagr from 2010 to 2015 and to 30% cagr from 2015 to 2019
Evidence of growth in demand: a key question for flex has been whether supply expanded irrationally.  While we do not have direct data on consumption, we can look at an important proxy – occupancy:
We note that mix affects the occupancy stats we show above, as newer entrants (i.e WeWork)  focused on large city centers. IWG, and to an extent Service Corp, operate in both metro centers and secondary cities and spread their network across co-work and serviced office concepts (that work well at lower occupancy levels than large co-working centers).  
As we will explain ahead occupancy rates at the mid 70%s range allow IWG to generate low-twenties post tax ROIC. Large co-working locations in expensive city centers (i.e. WeWork style) require high 80s occupancy to generate good returns.  We therefore view the above as a good indication that occupancy levels in the industry held up well and that rapid growth in supply was mostly absorbed by demand until the COVID induced crisis. There has not been a collapse in occupancy with supply expansion clipping at 24% cagr since 2010.
==> Demand grew at 20-25% cagr over the last decade and matched supply even as growth rates accelerated to 35% cagrs
What drives the success of flex ? we think it wins over fixed on the following dimensions of competition:
Price – flex renters pay high prices per sqf but take up far less space than they do in a single purpose, fixed leases. They end up paying around one-third less on their total real-estate expenses vs the fixed alternative (WeWork claims savings are two-thirds but we think they exaggerate). Savings also stem from efficient resource optimization of shared areas with other tenants (i.e. one kitchen, conference room and receptionist spread across several customers in a flex office center). Pooling of purchasing power by the flex operator also play a role in its ability to save money for the customer (from purchasing power on leases to buying internet bandwidth or office furniture) 
Flexibility – allows renters to move from commitments of 5-7 years to 1-year, materially reducing operational risk and enhancing optionality 
Capital Efficiency – offloads lease liabilities from customers’ balance sheets 

Flex should continue to take share and grow at 15-30% cagr for the next 5 years:
We view COVID19 as an accelerator for the flex concept for two main reasons:
1. In a world with more work-from-home (WFH) corporations still need team members to meet in person. Face to face meetings are required to sustain companies’ cultures and to enable processes, which do not transport well to video conferencing (i.e. ad-hoc creative processes, informal data exchanges, processes where body-language plays an important role such as negotiations, work flows that require continuous supervision, etc. – the list is long).  Instead of relying on central HQ buildings it will be more efficient for some but not all companies to use satellite offices located near their employees’ suburban living areas, facilitated through 3rd party flex networks 
2. The challenge of managing real estate in a world with more uncertainty and complexity will drive outsourcing to third party real estate operators.  If managing buildings post covid will require more health-related safety resources, lower density per employee, and involve increased risk of shutdowns (think next pandemic) then companies should make the logical conclusion that: 1. real-estate and office management is a business process better outsourced to professional firms that make it their core competency (with flex operators as natural choices) and 2. that companies should spread their workforce geographically to maintain redundant locations going forward (i.e. reduce dependency on one large HQ building)
Can we find any evidence that supports this thesis?  Initial indications are positive. In a Survey conducted by CBRE on July 17, 2020 that tapped 126 senior real estate executive at large companies (50% Fortune 500, 10% Fortune 100; 60% global, 20% America), we found the following questions relevant to our discussion:
a. “73% of respondents expect flexible office space will play some role in future strategy” (for reference, per The Instant Group, today 44% of Fortune 100 use flex)
b. “33% expect to use more flexible office space (i.e. serviced office, suites, coworking)”
c. Of those 33%, about 18% (of total surveyed) see both an “increasing” and “significant” role for flex and 15% see an “increasing” and “minimal” role
We can point to additional comments by industry players and to surveys indicating similar outlooks for flex post COVID19.  But we found the CBRE survey as the most current and statistically significant, so we used its findings to try and simulate the funnel of demand over the next 5 years based on intent:
An additional approach is to look at penetration rates and expectation for lift in usage.  On this front we point to a Cushman & Wakefiled survey of 579 corporate real-estate professional:
a. 63% of global organization utilize coworking somewhere across their portfolio
b. Those that use flex, have 3% of workforce in flex setting on a regular basis
c. And they expect to reach 10% utilization in 2 years and 15% in 5 years
d. Those who used flex are very satisfied with it, with 65% having positive/very positive view of flex. Importantly the more these customers used flex, the higher their satisfaction score 
Taking these finding, we tried to construct demand growth based on workforce sizes, current utilization and expectations for lift in usage:
While playing with numbers is easy, we think the above exercise applies conservative assumptions. Importantly the figures suggest that flex is still a tiny piece of the entire office base and directly addressable demand. Therefore, for flex to grow it doesn’t have to fit every company, just enough of them. Given that flex has been adopted by a very wide range of industries and company sizes (around 40% large corporates, 25% mid-sized with the balance in SMB) and taking into account its low penetration today and rapid expansion for the last two decades, we conclude that   
==> Flex should compound at 15-30% volume cagr from 2019 to 2025 
As an additional sanity check to our analysis we looked at what 3rd party RE advisors think: JLL projects that 30% of total office space will be flex by 2030 (reaffirmed as of June 2020); The Instant Group’s projects that 12.5% of total office space will be flex by 2023 (reaffirmed as of July 2020); and CBRE sees flex reaching 13% penetration by 2030 in the USA.  These projections imply volume cagr of 20-35% going forward.
Demand will grow and supply is balanced but is it a good business to be in?
The short answer is yes. We see excellent returns at the single unit level and good returns for large operators that achieve scale.
Single Unit economics at IWG: the following is a breakdown of the IWG mature centers’ p&l and roic:
We take away the following insights from the above analysis of IWG’s developed estate:
1. At maturity the returns for the IWG estate are excellent with or without loading the company’s corporate overhead – growing such an estate generates a lot of value
2. Scale at the network level yields significant advantages: every 10% difference in the size of the footprint, absorbs 1% of corporate overhead. IWG is 50% larger than its closest competitor (WeWork, post it expected restructuring) and >10X bigger than the third largest operator in the market. Furthermore, landlord contributions make up 20% of gross capital spent. A flex operators with a strong brand that is perceived as an anchor tenant drives substantial incremental savings on this front relevant small independent flex providers (landlords make an effort to secure IWG and maybe WeWork as tenants far more that they do the next Joe Shmoe flex provider with one to three centers). We therefore see IWG possessing material cost advantages versus all other competitors in the flex industry.  
3. We estimate that a flex center’s cost base is around 70% fixed in the short-term, and around 45% of its cost base is fixed medium-term.  Given that revenues fall around 20% during downturns, a flex center is an economic unit with very high operational gearing. This dynamic holds several important implications
a. Operators who get their leases, center setup costs (=depreciation) and sg&a bases incorrectly find themselves in a world of hurt during recessions. These pains remain as we exit downturns since operators need to return to peak occupancy to generate returns. Therefore, those who accelerate growth when the market looks strong usually end up with misaligned leases priced at the top. This is the dynamic that creates fast growth before the peak of the market and prolonged restructuring well after the downturn. See WeWork’s situation...
b. The operational gearing and cyclicality are partly the reasons why the flex space is an industry with low barriers to entry but very high barriers to success over the long-term.  It is easy to start a flex business during ebullient periods, but the history of the industry proves that many entered but few flourished.  
c. IWG is an exception to the rule with over 30 years of profitable growth but most importantly operational scaring that shaped its DNA as a very disciplined operator. We view this discipline as a material trait to bank on as equity investors in the space (…akin interestingly enough to the investment management business which is also a domain with low barriers to entry but high barrier to long-term success…).  
d. In industries where discipline and consistent levels of execution determine success, high performing players tend to grow regardless of the actions of new entrants, as most of the later do not survive (in other words new entrants are unable to hold on to share as the high execution operators march on)
  IWG is the leader of the flex industry 
Our research points to an industry made up of one large and profitable player (IWG), a second runner-up that is struggling as a consequence of undisciplined growth (WeWork) and a long-tail of small sub-scale operators particularly vulnerable to ceding share post covid-19:
We draw the following takeaways from the stats above:
a. IWG is the only scale player that is cash flow positive, with no debt and a stabilized portfolio
b. Only WeWork was close to attaining scale that would have allowed it to benefit from cost advantages similar to IWG. But WeWork is retrenching since its growth was undisciplined, resulting in a portfolio that is predominantly un-stabilized, cash flow negative and straddled with debt – the logical step for WeWork is therefore to curtail footprint expansion and build occupancy. We think this will mean that IWG will be the only player capable of buying assets at distressed valuations; however, it also induces risk that WeWork will lean into price discounts in the short term to fill space.
c. All the other players are subscale, will likely retrench their footprint and will not become scale players for years to come (if at all). IWG will likely remain the best viable option for corporate customers seeking to deal with fewer providers of flex networks to reduce complexity
   ==> IWG’s competitive advantage in the industry will expand going forward.  There is risk of pressure on pricing in the medium terms (2-3 years till players build up occupancy rates).  This is the time for IWG to deploy capital at very attractive returns
Past financial performance
We highlight the development of IWG key financial metrics over time:
IWG generated very high FCF per share growth (before growth capex) and has done so at robust returns.  We note that EBITDA – Maintenance CapEx lagged EBITDA growth as the intensity of maintenance capex grew over the last 5 years; however this spend was offset by higher contributions from landlord (known as Partner Contributions in IWG’s terms), which allowed IWG to hold onto strong overall returns.  Finally, FCF and EPS compounded at higher rates than EBITDA-Maint. Capex thanks to IWG’s effort to sell locations to franchisees from 2017 to 2019 (more on this front ahead)
Management 
Mark Dixon, the founder and CEO of IWG owns close to 30% of the company (a stake worth $1B).  We have followed him for many years and found him to be an extremely talented CEO that drills down to every little detail in the business.  Mark knows the details of almost every one of the centers in his 3,300 network, and approves every center opening or closing. We think this attention to detail and intensity are critical in a business with high operational complexity.  Mark views IWG as his life’s achievement and manages IWG for the next 20-30 years.  He is as an aligned CEO to long-term investors as we can find. He has also been through three downcycles in the industry (2001, 2008 and 2020), and has seen competitors come in and out of the space several times as they lacked discipline during industry peaks and found themselves without capital during downturns.  We have heard multiple times from peers and landlords that he is a very tough and able negotiator.  We think that positions him well to allocate capital during the current downturn and expect IWG’s to generate high 20% to low 30% returns on its p800mm of capital available for deployment.  Mark seems to believe in the future of the company as evident by the p91mm investment he put into the shares in April.
Valuation – Base Case 
We approach our base case valuation of IWG by analyzing the free cash flow generation of the mature estate (those centers open for 3 years or more) in a normal year, which we define as 2023.  We then add the value we expect IWG to generate on its free cash flow and incremental debt capacity at 2.5X net debt / ebitda (the company target), and assume this capital’s yield matures by the year 2026, which we discount back to 2023. 
Value of the mature estate in 2023:
The above analysis assumes the following
a. The market returns to normal mid-cycle conditions in 2023
b. Immature centers opened in 2018, 2019 and 2020 stabilize by 2023 
c. IWG closes 5% of its current footprint to drive occupancy up
d. Pricing in the industry reaches 95% of its 2019 level despite normal occupancy 
e. Occupancy of 76.3%, similar to previous mid-cycle levels
f. The company achieves 150mm of cost savings announced in 2020 with no additional efficiencies beyond that
g. The 2019PF results show how the estate would have looked with the immature centers stabilizing 
h. The 2023 results show how we expect the pf estate to do in 2023 with the assumptions described
i. We apply a multiple of 13.5X to the estate FCF generation, implying a 25% discount relative an S&P company to account for the cyclicality of the business

==> We arrive at a price target of 4.6p/share for the exiting IWG estate
  Combined with the value we expect IWG to generate from reinvesting its FCF and debt capacity we see the following price target on 2023 numbers:
  On the returns on capital deployed we assume
a. IWG cash flow generation of zero, ~180mm and ~350mm in 2020/21/22
b. Debt capacity of 2.5x to EBITDA per management targets at a blended cost of 5.5%
c. Capital is deployed at a 20% return, which is attained in 2026, discounted back to 2023 values at 10% and valued at 13.5x similar to mature estate. 
d. These assumptions yield 3.4p of value per share on capital deployed
  ==> We see a target price for IWG of 7p / share on 2023 numbers, which implies almost 2.6X the current stock price.  If attained by mid to late 2023 this implies an IRR of ~35%
Valuation – Upside Case in a Franchising Model
Over the last three years IWG began emphasizing a transition to a franchising model.  In 2019 it sold its Japanese footprint and Swiss estate to master franchise operators at 3X revenues. The company was also in advanced discussions to sell its US operations for similar multiples before COVID hit. Mark Dixon wants to push into a franchise model as a capital efficient route to growing the IWG network to 20-30K centers over time. We think franchising most of the estate makes a lot of sense as it will allow IWG to transition into a Marriot/Hilton mode of operation and materially increase shareholder value.  Below we show a case in which IWG can franchise its USA operations at 3X by 2023 plus 10% of additional revenues:
==> Upside case is for 9.2/shr or 3.5X and 50% IRR in 3 years
Downside Case
We envision a scenario with the following assumptions on 2023
a. IWG is forced to shrink its footprint by 10%
b. Occupancy is attained at 72% (4% below previous cycle norms)
c. Price drops 10% relative 2019
d. The mature estate receives a 35% discount to S&P multiples or 11.8x
e. The company is able to deploy cash at 15% returns 
In such a scenario we arrive at the following values
  ==> Downside case is for 2.2/shr or 20% downside and (7%) IRR in 3 years
Risk
Pricing: we expect the industry to suffer from price pressure in the short-term and possibly in the medium-term (2-3 years) until players build occupancy.  We think the risk of rapid supply growth is low as most players, aside from IWG, are capital constraint.  Therefore, if we are correct about the direction of demand, pricing will stabilize as occupancy returns in the industry to the mid 70% blended rate
Competition from fixed office landlords: while flex is still just over 2% of the total office footprint, it had been absorbing around a third of the market’s growth in recent years.  This rapid absorption does put pressure on some landlords to offer shorter-term leases (of 1-2 years) to meet demand.  Such offerings could absorb the incremental flex customer whose primary driver is the flexibility of a short lease. However, we point out that while flexibility is a key driver for flex users it is not the only driver. Flex also competes well on price, capital efficiency and service: in a recent C&W survey more than 40% of flex users saw it as an effective means to reduce costs, 30% to improve employee retention and 30% as a networking tool.  We therefore think landlords that offer 1-2 year leases will absorb only a portion of the demand for flex. We also see covid19 driving large companies towards outsourcing their real-estate operations to reduce complexity and for some to seek distributed network solutions (where office landlords are not setup well both from a geographical and service model).  Our conclusion is that office landlords switching to shorter term leases could become a directional headwind that slows growth but will not halt or reverse flex’s expansion. 
Competition from new entrants: we see the main risk on this front from the likes of JLL/CBRE deciding to enter the flex space with force. Also, hotel operators are potential entrants as well. As an example, Accor announced pre covid19, its intent to enter flex with the goal of building a network of 1,200 centers. We believe post covid19 all these players will be measured and rational in their growth plans. Ultimately their entrance should benefit IWG as institutional quality operators should drive market acceptance and introduce rationality to the industry during the next market peak.
Macro conditions: if we enter a prolonged depression, and experience unemployment rates akin to 1930s levels (25% unemployment, 15% net corporate bankruptcies), IWG will suffer. But in such an environment the weak operators will be wiped off and enable IWV to accelerate share gains. IWG is already making the necessary adjustments to sustain positive free cash flow in 2020 and certainly in 2021 and is effectively debt free. It can tap its committed shareholder base and raise additional capital (unlike many competitors) so it will survive.  Holding the shares will hurt in the interim but we don’t see capital impairment in this scenario, just lower IRR.
Demand for flex structurally broken: we could be wrong and post covid-19 the flex market retrenches as current customers of flex reverse course and do not renew subscriptions.  Companies move solely to WFH modes.  We think this is a low probability scenario based on both the structural reasons we showcased and recent surveys indicating customer expectations to increase their flex usage.
Management: Mark Dixon is crucial for the success of IWG – he serves as a key facilitator of operational excellence at IWG as well as capital allocator and risk manager.   A different CEO would mean a different IWG and would require a reevaluation of the thesis.

  Cablevision Holdings Capitalization
Because the stock I am recommending is a holdco with a 39% in the underlying company, the VIC headline format does not adequately capture the capitalization of the company. 
  Please see below the capitalization of Cablevision Holdings (CVH AR) today and proforma for the mandatory tender of minorities in Telecom Argentina (TEO). Cablevision, as per its shareholder agreement with Fintech, the other major shareholder of TEO,  would need  tender for 4.5% of the shares of Telecom Argentina (TEO). The price is being negotiated, but I assumed $20 per TEO share.

  Type of Situation
Complex corporate structure. Overreaction to a temporary setback resulting from a macro crisis. 
  Thesis
By buying shares of Cablevision Holdings  (CVH AR), one is investing in a holding company that has voting control and 39.1% economic interest in the leading cable TV/telecom service provider in Argentina (Telecom Argentina (TEO)) for 4x depressed (2018) EBITDA and 3x normalized EBITDA.  
In 2018 Argentina suffered a deep recession and a 50% devaluation of its currency. Revenues of Telecom Argentina (TEO), Cablevision’s underlying operating company,  declined 30% in USD terms,  from $6.3 billion to $4.5 billion. EBITDA declined 25% in US$ terms, from $2 billion to $1.5 billion.  
Based on historical precedent, profitability should recover to prior (2017) levels in US dollars in the next two to three years. I believe this is a conservative assumption.  
EBITDA recovery will additionally benefit from merger synergies and cost rationalization measures under new management. Telecom Argentina was not efficiently run for decades as a subsidiary of Telecom Italia. In 2018, due to a merger and change of control, the company is now managed by owner operators with a record of value creation. New management is targeting $2.2 billion in NPV of synergies. Cablevision’s share of those synergies (39%) is equivalent to 90% of its current market capitalization.   
Latin American telecom companies trade at 5x EBITDA. Cable companies trade at 8x EBITDA. Cablevision Holdings business mix is roughly half broadband/cable and half mobile.
Applying a blended multiple of 6x to normalized EBITDA ($2 billion in two to three years) would result in a tripling of Cablevision Holdings’ market capitalization.  
Cablevision Holdings (CVH AR) is a  holding company trading at a 50% discount to the current market capitalization of the underlying operating company, Telecom Argentina (TEO). The true free float of Telecom Argentina (TEO) when adjusting for strategic investors that form part of the control group with Cablevision (Fintech, Anses) is 9%. Cablevision Holdings is currently negotiating with the CVM (local SEC) the terms of a mandatory tender offer for the minorities. Based on its agreement with partner Fintech, it must tender for half of that float or 4.5% of TEO shares. I believe that in the next two years TEO could possibly be delisted, making Cablevision Holdings (CVH AR), the only publicly traded vehicle to own the underlying entity thus eliminating any holdco discount. 
The downside risk is low in my opinion because the valuation is depressed, the earnings are depressed, and the balance sheet is well capitalized. Telecom Argentina has 1.2 turns of net debt to depressed EBITDA. Cablevision Holdings has $210 million of net holdco debt which adds 0.15x of EBITDA to the leverage.  Cablevision will likely finance the tender of the minorities, adding another 0.10x turn of leverage to the structure. 
Profitability is unlikely to deteriorate further even an under adverse political/macro scenario because Argentina already suffered a sharp devaluation and is already coming out of a  deep recession in 2018.  
In the unlikely event that there is an adverse outcome to the October 2019 presidential elections, I believe that this business will not be materially affected because the underlying demand for broadband is strong and the competition to Telecom cannot deliver the same quality of service in either broadband or mobile. ARPU’s are depressed in USD terms. 
  Background
In August 2016, Grupo Clarin, Argentina’s largest media group, announced its intention to contribute its cable, broadband, and data transmission assets, into a new company called Cablevision Holdings and spin it off to shareholders through a distribution in kind. In July 2017, prior to completing the spin off,  Grupo Clarin decided to merge the assets of Cablevision Holdings  with Telecom Argentina (TE0), a leading telecom operator, in exchange for a 39% stake and controlling position in the surviving entity. The merger created the only “quadruple play” cable/telecom service provider in Argentina.  In August 2017 Cablevision Holdings (CVH AR), now a pure holding company with a 39.1% stake in the newly merged entity, was finally spun out to Grupo Clarin shareholders. The shares were well received, reaching a peak price of US$28.64 per share and peak market capitalization of $5.2 billion in January 2018 (versus $1.1 billion today). 
  Argentina’s economy has been in relative decline since the Great Depression due to populist policies and corruption. The 1990’s were a period of hope under the orthodox policies of finance minister, Domingo Cavallo, but he was ultimately unable to curb Peronist political interests and rein in fiscal spending. By the end of the decade, Argentina lost access to capital markets. In 2002 the country defaulted on its debt and abandoned its currency peg. This period was followed by twelve years of populist, incompetent, and corrupt government under Nestor Kirchner and his wife, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. 
  Hope and foreign capital returned in 2015 with the election Mauricio Macri, a reformist committed to orthodox economic policies. The stock market doubled in US Dollar terms. Accommodative credit markets enabled the country to issue a 100-year bond.  However, President Macri inherited a difficult situation: a 5% current account deficit, a 5% primary fiscal deficit, high inflation, and an overvalued currency. In 2018, capital markets saw through these imbalances, and a currency run ensued. The Argentine Peso suffered a 50% devaluation, leading to skyrocketing local currency interest rates (60%+) and a deep recession. 
  The Merval Index dropped 65% peak to trough in USD terms,  to levels not seen since 2013. Telecom Argentina (TEO) dropped from a peak price of $40/ADR in January 2018 to a low of $13/ADR in April of 2019, a 68% decline. It has since recovered to $18/ADR.  Cablevision Holdings (CVH AR, CVHSY)  dropped from a peak price of $28.65/share to a low of $3.80/share, an 87% decline in USD. It has since recovered to $6.31/share. 
    Reasons why the opportunity exists
Fear around the October 2019 presidential elections
After having been burned, investors now fear that President Macri will not be reelected in the upcoming October 2019 election and that Argentina will revert to a Kirschner led populist government. They are taking a wait and see approach. I believe it is unlikely that Cristina Kirschner can win due to the high rejection levels in the polls. However, if she were to win, I think the operations of the business would not be greatly affected.  This is a long conversation, but I’m happy to elaborate in Q&A if anyone is interested. 
  Large macro crisis and devaluation which impacted corporate profits greatly
Profitability in USD of all domestically exposed Argentine companies has declined significantly. In emerging markets, currencies overshoot during an economic crisis. Periods of over shooting are usually followed by an appreciation or stabilization of real effective exchange rates. See a chart of Argentina’s real effective exchange rate since 1998 below. Based on historical precedents, I expect a real appreciation of the currency or at least stabilization which would provide a tailwind to companies such as Cablevision which have local currency revenues and dollar denominated debt.  The market is looking backwards. 
    Cablevision Holdings (CVH AR) is not in the Merval Index and is not widely followed
The stock is actively covered by a small brokerage house called Allaria Ledesma y Cia. 
  Trading liquidity of the shares has completely dried up
Lack of liquidity is a legitimate reason for undervaluation, but in all markets liquidity is procyclical. The free float of Cablevision Holdings is 22%. However, if one excludes other long-term holders outside of the control group, free float is only 11%. The real free float at current market prices is $114 million.  At its peak, the stock had a $5.2 billion market capitalization and a real free float of $572 millon). It  traded at least $1 million daily and occasionally traded $6 million a day. Today the stock barely trades.   I believe that it is possible to find blocks of stock and accumulate a $5 million position in the company. I also believe that once the tender for Telecom Argentina (TEO) shares is completed, Cablevision Holdings (CVH AR) will become the only vehicle to invest in these assets.  
    Cablevision Holdings Shareholder Structure 
The controlling shareholders of Cablevision Holdings are the Noble Herrera family, Hector H. Magnetto, Jose Antonio Aranda, and Lucio Rafael Plagiaro. They started this cable business forty years ago and have grown it through organic build out and acquisitions. 
  The table below summarizes the shareholder structure of Cablevision Holdings (CVH AR):
 

  The Telecom Argentina-Cablevision Merger 
Between 2013 and 2016, through a series of transactions, Fintech, a financial buyer controlled by seasoned distressed investor, David Martinez, acquired Telcom Italia’s controlling stake in Telecom Argentina.  In July 2017, Fintech and the Clarin Group negotiated a merger between Telecom Argentina and Cablevision Holdings’ cable, broadband, and data transmission assets. The merger was approved by the regulator, Enacom on December 2017 and by the anti-trust authority, CNDC, in June 2018. 
  The chart below summarizes the ownership of Telecom Argentina post-merger:  
 




  Business Description
Since the Cablevision Holdings (CVH AR) is a pure holding company, this summary is entirely focused on the business of Telecom Argentina. 
  Integrated telecom service providers are generally mediocre businesses in terms of return on capital. They operate in a high fixed cost, low variable cost, capital-intensive industry and offer a somewhat undifferentiated service with relatively low switching costs. However, telecom service providers globally exhibit a wide range of profitability depending on factors such as: regulatory environment, business mix, and market structure.  For example, several incumbents in Continental Europe, have suffered dramatically in the last decade due to a tough regulatory and competitive environment. The United States telecom service providers, on the other hand, have benefited from a relatively benign competitive environment. Argentina, despite all its macro issues or perhaps because of them, falls into the benign category. This is reflected in Telecom Argentina’s margins. Note that margins are up in 2018 despite a 50% decline in the currency and 6% GDP contraction due to the early benefits of the merger:

Within telecommunications services, different businesses exhibit different levels of profitability.  Fixed line is a declining business. Mobile is a competitive business with a somewhat undifferentiated product, high churn, promotional pricing, and continuous capital deployment needs. Cable tends to be a much better business due to the upgradability of hybrid fiber coaxial architecture; its dominance of the “last mile;” and its unmatched ability to deliver high speed broadband connectivity to the home.  Telecom Argentina’s business mix is roughly 40% mobile, 50% cable/broadband/pay-tv, and 10% fixed line.  
  The mobile business in Argentina is a stable three player market dominated by Telecom Argentina (TEO), Claro, a subsidiary of Carlos Slim controlled America Movil (AMX), and Telefonica Argentina, a subsidiary of Telefonica de Espana (TEF SM).  Telefonica and Claro have not been as focused on developing their networks as Telecom. Telefonica’s parent has been in a deleveraging mode, and Claro has been focused on Brazil. Telecom Argentina’s focus on expanding 4G coverage and delivering superior service quality have enabled it to capture a greater share of stable, higher quality postpaid customers with greater data usage and lower churn. As a result, Telecom has a 32% market share of mobile revenues but a far greater 48% share of mobile EBITDA. 
  In cable and broadband Telecom Argentina is the undisputed market leader following the merger with a 56% market share of revenues. It is difficult to discern the exact share of profits because there are many smaller niche players in pay TV and broadband that do not provide profitability data.  But, it is probably fair to guess that it is the most profitable given its far superior network in terms of broadband speeds. The second biggest competitor in Pay TV is Direct TV, which delivers its signal through satellite and therefore has limited capabilities in providing two-way internet broadband connectivity. The second largest competitor in broadband is Telefonica with less than half the scale of Telecom and relies mainly on an outdated ADSL network. 
  Telecom’s dominance is reflected in its EBITDA margins which, notwithstanding the macroeconomic shock, achieved a level of 33.5% in fiscal year 2018, superior to Comcast, Verizon, ATT, and most incumbent cable and telecom players globally. Furthermore, the merger synergies from combining functions such as CRM, IT, purchasing, which management assigns an NPV of $2.2 billion have not been fully realized because antitrust approval was not granted until July of 2018, delaying the implementation of certain measures. 
  Capital expenditures in 2018 were elevated at 25% of revenues. This was driven by an unprecedented push to deploy 4G sites and expand the Hybrid Fiber Coaxial network in order to gain coverage in areas where the two companies’ footprints did not overlap. Longer term, the plan is to maintain capex closer to mid to high teens of revenues in line with historical levels.

  In summary, Telecom is a dominant mobile/cable/broadband service provider with a modern network, high margins, and a history of cash generation and dividend distributions operating in a relatively benign competitive and regulatory environment. 
  Balance Sheet 
The company is conservatively capitalized. Telecom Argentina’s (TEO) net debt/trailing EBITDA is 1.2x. This is based on very depressed EBITDA. Cablevision Holdings’ net debt/trailing EBITDA when consolidating TEO and holdco debt is 1.35x again based on depressed EBITDA. If one adjusts the debt proforma for the acquisition of the minorities, it increases to 1.45x. Telecom Argentina (TEO) paid $988 million in dividends in 2018. This was an unusually high dividend. This year, it has paid $140 million thus far. Dividends payment this year will be lower due to the desire to maintain financial flexibility. Thirty nine percent of these dividends flow to Cablevision Holdings. 
  Valuation
The way I think of valuation is the following way. Historically, it has taken one to two years to recover pricing in US$ for telecom service providers in Argentina following a devaluation. Therefore, I think it is reasonable that in two to three years, the Company’s revenues will revert to US$6 billion and EBITDA will revert to $2 billion, the level attained in 2017. This is conservative because it does not account for any of the merger synergies. Management guided to a $2.2 billion NPV of merger synergies and this management has a four decades long history of successful acquisitions.  
Applying an EBITDA multiple of 6x and use $2 billion of EBITDA (35% EBITDA margin), I arrive at an enterprise value of $12 billion which would result in a tripling of Cablevision Holdings stock. In the table below, the enterprise value of Cablevision has been adjusted to include the added debt associated with the mandatory tender of the Telecom Argentina (TEO) minorities. The tender is dilutive to Cablevision Holdings’ valuation given the 50% holdco discount.

      Note: Based on 2017 EBITDA of $2 billion
      If one looks at it in terms of EBITDA- Capex one arrives at a similar result. Comparable companies in the region trade at 12x EBITDA-Capex. Capex at Telecom Argentina is currently elevated at 25% of revenues due to the aggressive rollout of 4G and upgrading of the legacy Telecom network. I think a 15% EBITDA-capex margin is conservative based on history. Cablevision standalone historically operated at closer to 20%. If one applies the 15% EBITDA- Capex margin to 2017 revenues of  $6 billion it generates $900 million. Comps in the region trade at roughly 12 that number. That would yield an enterprise value for $11 billion or a $23/share price target for Cablevision versus the current $6.32/share. 
  Conclusion
Having invested in Latin America for the past twenty five years, I have experienced wide and recurrent swings in sentiment and valuation. Consider the foreign debt of Argentina. The country defaulted on its dollar debt in 2002 paying only 37 cents on the dollar.  In 2017 the country issued a 100 year maturity bond bond traded as high as 104 for a YTW of 6.85%. Today that “100 year bond” is trading at 77 cents on the dollar. I am not recommending Argentine sovereign debt because I think the probability of another default is not immaterial.  
  However,  I believe Argentines, who are amongst the highest consumers of social media in the world in terms of hours spent online per capita according to a study by We Are Social, will continue to spend time online. As Cablevision Holdings  improves the legacy Telecom networks, speeds will improve and usage will  increase. The performance gap between the Cablevision/Telecom network and its major competitors will widen further. Cablevision will continue to capture the majority of higher quality premium customers leading to higher ARPU and lower churn than competitors. The economy will recover from current levels. Merger synergies will continue to flow through leading to a further expansion in EBITDA margin. Given the quality of the company and the quality of the management, once worries about Argetinian macro and politics have dissipated. the stock will trade at 6x EBITDA multiple at some point (versus the  8x multiple awarded by the market  in 2017).  This will result in a tripling of the shares sometime in the next 2-4 years.
   I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

Long CVSG (CVSG LN Equity)
Summary
Covid accelerated the ongoing secular trend towards more pet ownership, and increasing spend-per-pet.  CVSG is a rare pure-play on that theme.
CVSG is the 2nd largest vet hospital network in the UK, with a fully integrated offer including diagnostic labs, crematoria, and an online pharmacy.  CVSG has played a leading role in consolidating the UK vet market, alongside Private Equity.  From 2014-2021E, they have averaged +20%/yr EPS growth, driven by +MSD SSS and highly accretive acquisitions of mom & pop vets.
This track record is inclusive of having ‘blown up’ in 2018, when CVSG got out over their skis with several acquisitions outside of their core circle of competence (including attempted expansion into continental Europe and farm animal).  They subsequently stopped doing deals, fixed the Balance Sheet, and are just now getting the M&A machine back up and running, this time re-focused within their core (1-3 site small animal hospitals, in the UK). 
Thesis is predicated on 4 points:
1) Pet care is a secular growth industry, with Covid creating a step-function higher in the pet base, on top of which pet owners are spending more each year on their pets’ health.
2) Runway for strong earnings growth as the result of MSD+ SSS, supplemented by their highly accretive M&A program (supported by an under-levered BS vs. history), and significant room to expand hospital margins back to prior peak.
3) Scarce asset as the only public UK pure-play vet services company, coveted by both PE-backed peers and vet product manufacturers (see Mars acq of WOOF, Nestle stake in IVC) .
4) Trading at a discount to private peers and precedent animal hospital transactions.
  Company Overview
CVSG is the 2nd largest vet hospital owner in the UK with ~8% share and ~£500m in annual revenues. The market comprises of 5 national players with 50% of the mkt, with the remaining 50% served by a fragmented tail of independent practices. The market has been consolidating over time and CVSG has played a leading role.
The other 4 large players are IVC (owned by EQT), Vets4Pets (owned by PETS LN a pet product retailer), VetPartners (owned by BC partners) and Medivet.
CVSG offers fully integrated end-to-end services including first-opinion treatments (typical vet clinic visit serving the day-to-day needs of pets), complex surgical procedures, laboratory diagnostic testing, cremation, and an online pharmacy.
Business is broken into 4 segments: Vet practices, Laboratories, Crematoria and Animed Direct (online medicine dispensary).
Vet Practices:
Currently operate 480 practices incl 8 surgical centers of which 449 are in UK, 25 in Netherlands and 6 in Ireland.
CVSG has primarily grown their practice footprint through accretive deals typically buying for 8-10x synergized EBITDAx. Post acq, CVSG typically keeps the local established brand names of the acquired practice. CVSG provides centralized back office support and generates significant cost savings on supplies through bulk purchases.  In a typical deal, they can take an independent vet’s EBITDA margin from LDD% to high-teens%.
Practices split into 4 categories:
Small animal (70% of practices): classic primary care vet practices for household pets like cats and dogs. This is the bulk of clinics
Equine: (11% of practices): practices treating horses
Farm Animal: (11% of practices): clinics treating farm animals. I.e livestock, cattle, etc
Referral (7% of practices): most sophisticated level of care. These facilities serve pets that were referred by a vet for specialist services including orthopedic surgery and neurology, internal medicine, cardiology, oncology and diagnostic imaging
Within the practices division CVSG sells their own branded pet products under the “MiPet” brand, at a significantly higher margin than third-party products.  This is why pet product companies (especially food) want to own vet hospitals.  More on that below.
Also have a subscription service “Healthy Pet Club” offering healthcare coverage for routine treatments such as worms, flea/tick and regular health checks. Plans start at £14/month.  Healthy Pet Club subscriptions reflect more than 10% of revenues.
Diagnostic Laboratories:
Network of labs performing diagnostic services to CVSG practices (~30% of revs) and third parties (~70% of services). Tests cover a full range of services incl hematology, endocrinology, microbiology, PCR, etc.  This is a scale/density/network business, one that would be difficult to replicate.
Crematoria:
Pet cremation and clinical waste collection for vet practices across 7 facilities. ~50% internal sales/~50% 3rd party sales.
Animed Direct:
CVSG’s online retailer for prescription meds, pet food and OTC drugs. This is a fast growing, low-margin segment.
  Financial Snapshot (FYE 6/30)
Consistent +MSD digit like-for-like (LFL) growth over the last 5 yrs including double digit in the lab, crematoria and Animed businesses.
Margins fell on the 2018 re-set, and remain below peak on an apples-to-apples basis (adj for IFRS 16).
Covid:
In the peak of covid shut down half their clinics and furloughed a significant amount of employees. By July 2020, revenues had recovered to pre-covid levels and they re-opened the majority of practices while permanently closing 7% that were unprofitable. Finished F20 (6/30 FYE) with +1 LFL, including -15 during the trough of Covid.  During the second set of UK lockdowns, vet practices were deemed essential, and did not close.
Current trading:
Through 6mo ending 12/31/2020, LFL accelerated to +7 (including practices +5).  And has further accelerated to +10 (including practices +7) in the first two months of 2021, driven by the step-up in the pet population + pet spend.
  Thesis
CVSG is a scarce/special asset:
They’re the only pure-play publicly traded vet services company and would be coveted by 1) PE-backed vet peers who are looking to consolidate the vet market, and 2) vet product manufacturers, who buy clinics as a captive distribution channel (see Mars/WOOF, and Nestle/IVC).
Further, there are strong secular tailwinds for the industry as pet adoption increases and people spend more on their pets. CVSG saw new pet registrations at their hospitals grow 17% in the 6mo ended 12/31/2020.  Those pets will require vet care for the next 10+yrs.
Path to significant earnings growth driven by SSS strength, margin improvement, and a return to accretive M&A:
Long history of +MSD SSS, having accelerated towards +HSD post-covid.
Vet practice margin is just 16-17% in F21E (adj for IFRS 16) vs their prior peak of 18% in 2017, which compares to 18-20% for WOOF’s vet practice business prior to getting bought out by Mars. 
On top of the margin story, CVSG is more aggressively going after accretive M&A, having paused their acq program starting in 2018.  They have significant firepower to do so, with 0.7x debt vs history of 1.5-2.0x.
Trading at a discount to pure-play private peers and precedent transactions:
CVSG is currently trading at 15-16x NTM EBITDA = 2.8x NTM revs.
This is a discount to IVC their closest peer who just raised €3.5bn at a reported €12.3bn valuation (from SilverLake and Nestle) on ~25x 2022E EBITDA. This valuation is up 4x from IVC’s last raise 2 yrs ago. Prior to the raise they had been planning to IPO but this has been put on hold.  IVC has ~1500 facilities vs CVSGs ~480 and was just valued at ~€12.3bn EV and  ~25x F22 EBITDA vs CVSG at ~£1.25bn EV and ~15-16x in-place EBITDA and cheaper if vet practice get back to prior peak
In 2016, IVC was initially acquired by EQT at a reported price of 17-19x EBITDA
WOOF was acquired by Mars in 2017 for $9bn = 15-16x EBITDA

  There is more to HALL, but I just want to start by pointing out that an attractive business is hiding in plain sight within HALL that many do not seem to be aware off. And management seems to be thinking the same as on Jan 21, 2021 it put out a press release stating that it was working on creating a separate entity around its specialty business with its own CEO. The company said they are working with among others, Raymond James. To me it looks like someone is creating a sellable entity of a fast growing and profitable part of the HALL business. How much is a specialty insurer worth that writes gross premiums of $500 million plus, is growing premium volume at a healthy clip and has done so at a 90% average combined ratio since 2015 in the middle of a hard market?
One way to think about it is to look at $500 million in gross premiums at a 90% combined delivers a gross profit of $50 million. To a well-capitalized buyer, would they pay 6 times for that? Which would give us a sales price of $300 million.
Currently there are $18.14 million shares outstanding at a stock price of $3.81 that makes for a market cap of $69.11 million. Then we have about $100 million in debt and trust preferreds outstanding. For an EV of $170 million. If we get to assume that the above business is worth about $300 million then I get to an equity value of about $11 per share. My guess is that this business is worth more than $300 million in a world of low bond yields and SPAC money.
Hardening pricing market
It is widely talked about that finally after many years pricing has started to improve. Even my admitted home and umbrella policies have increased about 15% over last year, after multiple years of zero growth in pricing.
For HALL’s specialty businesses, mentioned above, pricing has improved markedly too. Year over year starting Q3 2017 through Q3 2020 we have seen pricing cumulatively improve by 52%. Especially over the last four quarters through Q3 2020 pricing has improved by double digits. For Q3 2020 the increase yoy was 20.3%. For Q2 2020 the number was 23%. For Q1 2020 was 15.2% and for Q4 2019 the price increase was 18.3%.
So, why is Hallmark trading at $3.8 per share?
Well, a lot of not so good things happened during 2020. Let me back up to 2019. I as well as many others assumed that HALL was an average insurer and consistent PYADs happened which frustrated many. My thought was that they were just an average undersized underwriter. Little did I know that overall HALL had done an excellent job building the above-mentioned specialty business, but all that was being obscured by the commercial auto business, more specifically the binding small truck business segment. All this time this binding small truck business was performing horribly and was being reported as part of the “specialty commercial segment”. So, while the PYADs kept coming on this binding small truck business there was no way to see how well the other specialty lines were doing.
HALL first caught my active interest when I read in the press release where they announced the decision to put the binding small truck business in run off and that this business had been responsible for more than 100% of the PYADs for the company since 2015. So, it looked that this one binding small truck company line that was causing all the bad news.
Then in the Q3 2020 presentation HALL broke out the performance of its specialty business ex the runoff binding small truck business since 2015. And this confirmed what I had suspected earlier. It truly was that binding small truck business that had caused all the damage and there was a valuable and growing specialty business within HALL after all.
Just to give one an impression as to how much damage this binding small trucking company line did, since 2015 the cumulative adverse development was $7.43 per share and if I assume that they will also blow through the corridor of the LPT then the total per share becomes $8.43 per share.
I am not going to expand to widely as to what happened within HALL for management to allow this binding small truck business to get so out of hand. I have heard theories from overconfidence in the ability to fix the problem or they were being gamed by brokers or social inflation and massive verdicts overwhelming all actuarial cost expectations. Who knows really, for me what is important is that the binding small truck problem is being put behind us and that there is a limit as to what it will cost us financially.
That brings me to the LPT deal. In order to maintain their rating, HALL had to do a deal with a reinsurer in order to limit loss exposure. They did an expensive deal with Darag. If you go to the Q3 2020 presentation you can find a visual representation of the deal as it can come across as somewhat complex. This deal reinsures all the binding small truck company business before Dec 31 2019. It consists of four layers.
Layer 1: This is the actual actuarial loss estimate through Dec 31 2019 that both parties agreed upon till then. HALL had to take a number of charges in order to provide the additional reserves for this layer for a total $151.2 million.
Layer 2 – The corridor: Think of this as the deductible for HALL. It represents $24.9 million. HALL will have to pay this before Darag takes over payments. Currently HALL is $6.7 million into the corridor which leaves about $18.2 million or $1 per share. Just to be conservative I assume HALL will end up paying the whole of layer 2. Although it is not for certain this will happen, after all these are still actuarial estimates.
Layer 3 and Layer 4: Once we hit total cash outflows of $176.1 million and through $240 million Darag will pay.
This caps losses for HALL. And assuming HALL will pay for the corridor, from an economic perspective the binding small truck company business has become economically neutral. No doubt this was an expensive deal, but it allowed AM Best to maintain the A- rating that is so important to HALL.
This deal also allows for HALL to focus on the left-over businesses, being the specialty commercial business, discussed above, the standard commercial business and the personal lines business. Below are stats for the personal lines business and standard commercial business.

  In standard commercial and personal lines, I keep hearing about high single digit, low double digit increases in pricing. Also, the higher cat losses for 2020 are at play too. Both standard commercial and personal lines are much smaller than the fast-growing specialty business, which makes sense. Why allocate that money to average businesses while you have a fast-growing and more profitable business to focus on.
It is my expectation that the sum of these businesses should be able to do well going forward, especially once the specialty business has its own corporate structure whose results will be visible to all. In addition, once it becomes more obvious to investors that HALL’s specialty business is an attractive franchise, I do expect a rerating towards closer to one-time current tangible book value.
So what is current “adjusted” tangible book value for the business
I come up with an adjusted tangible book value of $8.32 per share.
-        $9.6 per share in tangible book value end of Q3 2020.
-        Minus $1 per share for the corridor.
-        Minus $0.28 per share on the 2020 binding truck exposure. (Gross written exposure for binding truck exposure is about $24 million before ceding. Last policy will expire September 2021. I assume a 120% combined here or 28 cents per share.)
-        Total of $8.32 of adjusted tangible equity per share.
Current stock price 3.81.
Current price to adjusted tangible book value is 45%. I think this is a valuation that is way too low for this business, especially since the binding truck disaster is economically neutral going forward and since HALL has such an attractive specialty business that is in the middle of a hard market.
What is next?
Q4 2020 will report soon. Economically the hard market is working its way into earned net premium. I expect that during Q1 2021 we are seeing the same hard market dynamics. Offsetting that could be more conservative reserving and another adverse development on the corridor.
In time I will expect that HALL will continue to inform the investor public what an attractive business it has and the stock should rerate towards the $8/$10 level.

  Summary 
  We believe Tempur-Pedic stock is worth over $22 versus its present price of $13.65.    We arrive at this price target using a 15x P/E of 2006 estimated EPS of $1.50 which we believe is conservative given the company’s historical and projected EPS growth of over 40% per year.
  At present, TPX the stock is trading at 6.1x 2006E EBITDA, 9.2x 2006E P/E and generates over a 10% free cash flow yield.  Even if TPX only traded at Sealy’s valuation  the stock would trade at over $19.25.  We believe a substantial premium to Sealy (“ZZ”) is justified given that TPX is growing faster, has higher margins, significantly less leverage, and does not suffer the overhang of a large shareholder/former sponsor still looking to get out.
  We see several important potential catalysts on the horizon for TPX:
  -         Over 25% of the float is sold short based on a thesis that is, at best, stale.  We believe that the short thesis reflects an understandable, but erroneous view of TPX’s business model.
  -         We believe management will materially exceed guidance in coming quarters.  The results from Q1 2006 already provide strong evidence that the company’s 2006 growth rate is tracking well ahead of company guidance and consensus estimates.
  -         TPX has an underleveraged balance sheet and a management comfortable with leverage.  While the company has already repurchased almost 15 million shares since the fourth quarter of 2005, we believe that more aggressive alternatives will be under consideration in the near future.
  -         Entry into new specialty bedding categories.  The company views itself as a leader in the specialty bedding area, not just visco-elastic mattresses.  Its core competency is marketing, not manufacturing.   The new manufacturing facility in Albuquerque comes on line in Q4 2006, and has adequate capacity to manufacture new products.
  -         Hotel Partners.  Tempur-Pedic does not currently supply mattresses to hotel partners.  We believe the company is negotiating with hotel companies to become a large supplier.
  Business
  Tempur-Pedic is the world’s largest manufacturer and distributor of visco-elastic mattresses, with approximately 80% market share of visco-elastic mattress sales in the U.S.[1], and a 25% market share of specialty mattress sales in the U.S.[2]  TPX uses a unique distribution method which has established huge brand equity verified by our channel checks and the continuing strong operating performance of the company.
  The mattress is, counter intuitively, both growing and defensive.  The mattress industry posted 6.1% sales CAGR from 1984 to 2004 (2.6% unit volume growth and 3.4% pricing growth) and no down years even during recessions.
  The premium/specialty bedding segment demonstrates even better fundamentals than the category as a whole -from 2000 to 2004 sales for high-end mattresses at prices above $1,000 grew 19% versus 3% growth for mattresses below $1,000 (Tempur-Pedic mattresses retail for $1,199 to $5,499).[3] 
  The 2005 Short Thesis
  The short thesis on TPX originated in the middle of 2005 when TPX stock was trading at over 20x P/E.  The short thesis was/is basically that TPX’s margins and sales growth were/are not sustainable due to competitive entrants in the category. 
  While we believe that there has been some impact on TPX of these entrants, that impact has already been absorbed and more than reflected in the stock price (TPX declined from over $24 in June 2005 to below $10 in October 2005).  Shorts we have spoken to seem to be taking the lazy approach of making a 2005 trade a 2006 investment based on a misplaced view that implosion of the housing market will hurt TPX. 
  Competitive Entrants
  “The Chinese”  -  only 5% of a mattress’s delivered cost is labor.  Transportation is a very large percentage of product costs.  The realty is that Chinese visco products have been available for years and have yet to capture any real market share.
  “The Three S’s”  (Sealy, Simmons and Serta) entered the visco segment in the second half of 2005, rolling out products at a 20-30% discount to TPX.  The thinking here is that “big guys will crush TPX” but interestingly, TPX is actually the largest player in the industry in terms of EBITDA.
  Experience To Date
  TPX’s unit and dollar sales growth over the last five quarters is shown below:

  While there was some deceleration in sales growth from Q1 2005 to Q1 2006 this is clearly exaggerated by the extraordinarily difficult comparisons faced in the first quarter – up 51% in Q1 2005.  This was due to a price increase on TPX’s Celebrity product line effective 2/1/05.  In anticipation of this price increase, retailers increased their orders of the Celebrity product line prior to 2/1/05.
  With respect to the second half of 2005 management has attributed the slowdown in 2H 2005 to weakening consumers impacted by oil prices and weak consumer confidence figures shown after last summer’s hurricanes.  The reality is that TPX’s sales were probably impacted to some degree by competitor products.  That said, we will take the double digit unit and revenue growth at a 6x EBITDA/10% free cash flow yield any day.
  At the end of the day, TPX missed its 2005 guidance of $1.10 to $1.13 and reported actual
earnings came in at $1.07 – a ‘miss’ of 4%.  For this, the stock was taken down from $24 in June 2005, to below $10 in October 2005. 
  It is interesting to note that these competitive discounts have already begun to ease in 2006 – Sealy is currently only pricing at a $200 discount versus the $300-$400 discounts in 2005. Management confirms that the competitive environment in 2006 is much more rational than 2005.
  Competitive Entrants Part II – ‘The Margins Aren’t Sustainable’
  The other component to the “competitive risks thesis” is that TPX margins (which are much higher than its competitors) would be competed away as new entrants pressure the category.
  We believe that this risk is way overblown for two reasons:
  -The power of the brand/growth of the category
  - The TPX retail model
  Brand Power/Growth of Premium Category
  TPX enjoys unrivaled brand recognition in the visco category.  Channel checks indicate that consumers come in looking for “the wine glass” mattress or “the Swedish mattress”.   When customers are sold on the visco product they generally want “the real thing”.  We also observed that most retailers seemed to have 4 visco product offerings – three of which were TPX.  We also believe that TPX’s expanded product offerings will result in the addition of another visco slot for them, further diluting competitors share of floor space.   TPX has paid its dues in the form of 100’s hours and millions of dollars in “infomerricials.”  TPX spends almost 20% of revenue in sales and marketing expenses. As its revenue base increases, management has indicated that they will continue to maintain sales & marketing spending as a percentage of revenue.  We believe this will reinforce TPX’s lead in the specialty bedding category.
  Away from TPX’s position in the premium segment it is important to note that the premium segment itself its growing extremely rapidly.
      Retail Model
  While it is tough to quantify the value of the things such as qualitative views from dealers perhaps the best evidence of the value of the TPX brand comes from the fact that it has been able to sustain fundamentally different retail economics than Sealy, Serta, and Simmons mattresses.  The table below illustrates this.  Assuming the cost of goods for both companies is the same, but Sealy’s selling price for the same product is 20% less, we arrive at 12.5% gross margin for Sealy.  This level of margins is not sustainable, because Sealy will also incur overhead costs.

  The advantage that TPX has versus competitors is that it does not provide retailers like Sleepy’s and Mattress Firm with “co-op” advertising dollars.  Shorts have continued to claim that TPX was about to blink and make these payments – causing TPX’s margins to converge with Sealy etc.  This has not happened (and we will believe will not happen as TPX does not use a special event sales driven model).  
  TPX has its own national advertising campaign while competitors like Sealy allocate advertising dollars to retailers who typically do their own local advertising.  However, it is unclear how much of the co-op dollars are actually spent on advertising to support the brands – a large portion may be retained as additional profits for the retailer. 
  We spoke with a former CEO of one of the 3 S’s, who told us that these companies cannot compete with Tempur-Pedic on price on a sustained basis because of the math we have described above.  Ultimately, their sales strategy is driven because their visco-elastic products do not have brand recognition like Tempur-Pedic and hence have to rely on retailers to push their products because of lower prices.  However, a retailer is typically indifferent between selling a TPX mattress versus a Sealy mattress because the gross profit dollars are similar or often higher for TPX because of TPX’s high retail prices.  In our channel checks, we found that retailers often like TPX because customers come into stores already well-educated on TPX because of the company’s extensive TV advertising.

  We believe the company will materially exceed guidance in coming quarters -
 ---Q1 2006 Sales Growth Implies 26% Sales Growth in 2006
  We have evidence from Q1 2006 that suggests the sales growth weakness in the second half of 2005 has abated, and is likely to improve significantly in the next 3 quarters.  The table below shows adjustments to each quarter’s year-over-year sales growth versus the 22% annual sales growth for 2005.  We observe that in 1H 2005, the company had excess growth versus the annual run-rate, and this reverses in 2H.

(13.5%)
  The key question is, if you had to predict what the company’s year-over-year growth should have been in Q1 2006, how would you do it?  Assuming there are no known exceptional events in the quarter (such as the Celebrity Bed price increase in Q1 2005), you would take the company’s 2006 annual sales growth guidance, which is approximately 14% (mid-point of company’s sales guidance), and adjust it for the excess quarterly growth we saw in each quarter in 2005.  So our predicted growth in Q1 2006 would be 14% - 23% = -9%.  In other words, a -9% growth rate in Q1 2006 would correspond with 14% annual growth in 2006. 
  But instead, the company reported growth of +2.8% in Q1 2006, which is very impressive considering the huge comp from Q1 2005 the company was facing.  If we add the 23% adjustment from Q1 05, it implies an annualized run-rate growth rate of over 25%.  The 25.8% annual growth rate implied by Q1 suggests the reported growth rates for the next 3 quarters are likely to accelerate significantly.

    Remember that since Q1 2005, the business has supposedly been subject to ‘significant’ competitive pressures and erosion of market share, so in the span of one year we should intuitively have seen a much worse result than the +2.8% reported. 
  It is also worth noting that Tempur-Pedic’s growth rate will be positively impacted in the next 3 quarters by the recent (May) launch of two new, high-end mattresses – the Rhapsody Bed at a $3,099 retail price, and the Grand Bed at a $5,499 retail price.  The company has not given specific guidance on the retail penetration of these beds but when we spoke to managers at Mattress Firm (largest retailer of mattresses in the U.S.), we were told they are adding the Rhapsody bed to all stores, and are selectively adding the Grand Bed to stores in high-income neighborhoods.  The table below shows Tempur-Pedic’s historical slots per store, and the average mattress sales prices.

    The introduction of these 2 new products will boost not only ‘slots’ allocated to TPX per store, but will also put upward pressure on TPX’s average selling price.  This is an incremental positive as we try to extrapolate from growth rates observed in Q1 2006. 
  One important question – if our projections are true, why is management providing such conservative projections?  In 2005, the company had its first earnings miss in its history.  Our conversations with management suggest they are deeply embarrassed by the miss, and are now taking extra precautions to avoid any potential misses in the future.

Over the past 5 years Ladbrokes has dramatically underperformed its UK retail peers, William Hill and Paddy Power. While its retail performance was marginally weaker than peers, the key difference lies in the online segment where LAD’s revenues were roughly flat and profits down considerably while peers grew at c.30% CAGR. This has resulted in an overall lower earnings base compared to peers and a steep valuation discount.
In March 2013, Ladbrokes announced a new strategic partnership with Playtech whereby LAD’s online division is being outsourced to Playtech (PTEC – has been written up on VIC in the past). Learning from the WMH-PTEC experience and PTEC’s own performance track record we believe this will be a game changer.
Our scenario analysis shows a potential IRR range of between single-digit negative return to >40% over 3 years
Brief Business Description
Ladbrokes’ business can be divided into 2 categories:
Retail and related: cash cow with attractive fundamental characteristics
Gaming Machines (32% of net revenue) : Up to 4 per shop
OTC Betting (49% of net revenue)
Telephone & high rollers (1% of net revenue)
Online: high growth with large untapped opportunity
Investment Thesis
Over the past several years Ladbrokes shares have dramatically underperformed peers. In the past 5 years LAD shares are up 2% compared to 150% for William Hill and 325% for Paddy power. The reason for this is simple: while retail performance has been similar to WMH, online has dramatically underperformed. WMH online net revenue has grown at 34% CAGR while LAD’s has remained flat.

  Online earnings fetch approximately >2x the multiple of retail earnings. Therefore the revenue mix change has driven a large valuation disparity between the 3 UK peers whereby on a 2014 P/E basis Ladbrokes (20% of online) trades on 9.6x, WMH (>40% online) is on 13.6x and Paddy Power (70% online) on 18.7x. Therefore, solid performance of Ladbrokes online division would not only increase the earnings base, but also drive a significant re-rating.
William Hill Online JV
In late 2008 William Hill partnered with Playtech to form William Hill Online (WHO). WHO grew its EBIT from £55m in 2008 to £145m in 2012. In April 2013, WMH paid £424m to buy out PTEC’s 29% stake in WHO, implying a total valuation of nearly £1.5bn or 80% of LAD’s current market cap!
Ladbrokes-Playtech
Shortly before the WHO stake sale was completed, Playtech announced a new partnership with William Hill’s largest rival in retail, Ladbrokes. The deal went into effect in May 2013
The agreement is structured as follows:
–      Ladbrokes licenses PTEC’s casino games software and content from PTEC, replacing existing vendors
–      Mobile product to be developed on PTEC’s highly successful Mobenga platform
–      New Ladbrokes-Israel office established with ~100 highly experienced employees
–      Playtech runs the back office and supplies CRM and marketing though its PTTS subsidiary
Financial Terms:
–      Casino software is licensed at ‘normal commercial terms’
–      Ladbrokes-Israel is full subsidiary so the cost of salaries and fixtures is on LAD
–      Playtech provides PTTS and related services at its own cost with the following incentive:
Playtech is entitled 27.5% of the incremental EBITDA of Ladbrokes online over the 2012 base (£44m) in the form of a buyout at Ladbrokes overall group multiple at the time of trigger
The triggers are EBITDA growth of £35m, £70m and £100m by 2017
–      At least 25% of payment will be in LAD’s shares. PTEC has discretion to ask for more in shares
This deal is transformational for Ladbrokes as it fills all the gaps it had in its online segment including a strong mobile product, a single wallet platform and most importantly Playtech’s CRM and customer intelligence.
This will allow Ladbrokes to grow its online segments through the following avenues:
Improving player yield:
–      While LAD’s number of active players has grown 32% over the past 4 years, its yield per active player has declined 16%
–      Over the same period WHO’s number of active players has increased 39% and its yield per player has increased 69%!
  –      As a result, the yield per active Ladbrokes player went from 33% premium to a WHO player in 2009 to a 34% discount in 2012!
–      Reducing player yield discount from 34% to 10% would increase LAD’S EPS by 20%
  Growing with the market: The UK market has grown 11% CAGR over the past 5 years while the global market has grown >20% CAGR. LAD’s has not grown at all
Gaining Share:
–      LAD’s UK retail market share is 28% vs just 7% online
–      WHO has gone from 8.9% to 19% in 5 years
Earlier this year, Ladbrokes acquired Betdaq , the #2 betting exchange behind Betfair. This will allow it to integrate the exchange with the sportsbook which will offer a differentiated product in the market. Something Betfair is currently trying to build. This is scheduled to be in place by end of the year. Currently, ~30% of LAD’s sportsbook customers already use exchange betting. Keeping those customers on LAD’s site will increase share of wallet + enhance liquidity on the exchange. It also allows Ladbrokes to possibly enter international markets through the exchange and build liquidity as first mover.
Retail
In terms of retail, the business is roughly steady. 2%-3% annual decline in OTC betting due to shift online is offset by growth in revenue from gaming machines in the shops as well as low single digit % annual increase in number of shops. In general the UK bookmaker market has become quite consolidated with the big 4 now accounting for 85% of all shops vs just 40% 20 years ago. The company a 3 year cash payback on new shop openings.
Given the almost entirely inflation linked fixed cost base it is necessary to grow revenues of the retail business low single-digits annually to keep EBIT flat. Bears argue that as machine LFL growth has stagnated this year and OTC betting gross win margins will converge with online, retail earnings will decline sharply.
In terms of machines, we actually think 2014 may see a strong reacceleration as the company is currently rolling a new generation of machines across its estate. The prior 2 roll-outs generated year 1 LFL growth of 22%(2007) and 18%(2011). The company has launched several other initiatives such as loyalty cards to improve utilisation of its machines.
Regarding gross win margins, while online betting has been around for a long time, there is no evidence of any impact on retail gross win margins. That said the argument makes sense. However, market dynamics are such that lower gross win margins tend to drive higher wager activity resulting in a similar net revenue base. For example, Paddy Power matches its online and offline odds which means that their retail gross win margins are far lower than Ladbrokes’. In return its turnover per shop is double. Looking across products and companies, there is a clear negative correlation between turnover and gross win margin. Therefore, declining margins (if it happens) might not necessarily translate into declining revenue. It may well be that this would increase wagers which are currently declining.
Upside/downside
Our base case assumes the online division grows 22% CAGR out to 2017. This would achieve the middle-of-the range for EBITDA targets of the playtech deal. We also assume 4% lfl growth in machines in 2014 and 2% annually thereafter, while OTC gross win margins decline 30bps per annum and wagers per shop decline 1% per annum. Under such a scenario, assuming WMH’s current multiple and taking into account the 4.5% dividend we get an IRR of 25% over 3 years.
A more bullish outcome, achieving the high end of the playtech deal targets can generate an IRR of >40%.
In terms of downside, even if machines don’t grow, OTC margin declines 50bps per annum and wagers per shop decline 2.5%  while the online division grows in line with the market, we get a single digit negative return on the investment. Hence the risk-reward here seems very compelling.

As soon as the online division starts showing acceleration in growth which we think could happen in early 2014 the stock will start re-rating as investors begin to price in the probability of replicating the success of the WHO JV",2.0121256133152103,-5.526716868792804,34.36719216030447,38.87106705736031,10.549040899634436,13.316937802596593,21.951820827779397,28.776799273363896

Seed:
  Origin Agritech Limited, I believe, is one of the more interesting, long-term, investment opportunities I’ve come across to date.  Currently trading at a multiple of fiscal 2006 (yr. end Sept. 30) sales of 4.6x and an estimated 2.75x 2007 sales, Origin is conservatively priced based on its growth potential within an industry where acquisition multiples for market leaders have been between 2.9x to 3.3x sales.  As one of the first privately held and now premier, branded, hybrid, seed, companies in China, Origin is positioned to capitalize on this very fragmented, highly profitable, high barrier to entry, regulated market.
   To date, Origin represents roughly 2% of a $3+ billion seed market in China, which, as stated by management, makes Origin the largest vertically integrated seed company in China.  With expected revenues (recently reaffirmed by management) for fiscal 2006 of $55 - $60mm and adjusted net income at or above $11mm, Origin currently trades at 3.9x EV/Revenues and 21x EV/NI, respectively.  Although these multiples appear high based on Origin’s expected 2006 performance, sales in 2007 should nearly double based on expected organic growth of 30% - 35% (such an increase is likely, barring any unforeseen events, as Origin has already planted its crop for 2007) and a recent acquisition which should conservatively add between $15mm - $20mm in sales.  Such growth is expected to result in significant profitability for 2007, as the organic growth component is likely to generate margins of 15% - 20%, as it has done historically over the last three years, with growth from Origin’s recent acquisition also contributing to overall profits, but at margins that are less than Origin’s historical range (I’m not sure of the historical margins of the recently acquired company, just that they are less than Origin’s).  Profitability in 2007 should be further enhanced through Origin’s 34% interest in its Changrong joint venture, which currently generates corn seed sales of between $15mm – $20mm per year.  Beyond 2007, I believe Origin will continue to execute on its business strategy, continuing to grow its hybrid business at double digit rates, as well as capitalize on the emerging opportunity of GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) seeds in the Chinese market (more on this later).  
        Company:
  Origin Agritech Limited is a vertically integrated, nationally licensed operator engaged in the R&D, production, sale and distribution of hybrid seeds in China.  Primarily focused on corn, rice and cotton seeds, Origin, with its network of over 2500 first level distributors and 50,000 + second level distributors, supplies its product to all but one of the major provinces in China (I believe it’s Tibet). With the size of its core market estimated to be in excess of $3.0 billion, Origin, as the only nationally licensed seed company in China, continues to gain market share as it executes on its branding, service and product development initiatives. 
  Origin began back in 1990, when its CEO and founder, Dr. Han, started petitioning the Chinese government to establish the first privately held hybrid seed company in China.  After years of soliciting the central government, Dr. Han, in December 1997, was permitted to begin operations, which he did so by licensing hybrid seed technology from the major agricultural universities in China.  Dr. Han’s use of licensed technology enabled Origin to begin its operations with only $400,000 of invested capital, launching its first commercial product beginning in 1998.  Origin has since begun developing its own proprietary seeds and as of calendar year ending 2005 (calendar year ending has since changed to fiscal year ending June 30) had 12 internally developed seeds approved by the Chinese Ministry of Agricultural and in commercial production and distribution.
    Currently, Origin has 46 proprietary seeds in different stages of the regulatory process (usually a 3 year process) with the expectation of introducing between 40 and 50 new seeds per year into the government testing and approval cycle.  Of those seeds introduced, 5 to 8 will be approved following the 3 year regulatory process, which, over a 7 year cycle should result in the circulation of fifty commercially marketable seeds at any one time.  As a result, Origin’s distribution of revenues will gradually change from mostly licensed product today (96%) to mainly proprietary product by 2009 (70%).  With this change, margins should increase as licensing fees are reduced (such fees are nominal in their amounts) and as Origin introduces higher yielding, higher priced seeds into the market – an aspect of the hybrid seed market I find very compelling.
  The bulk of Origin’s revenues are currently generated from corn seed sales.  When Origin began its operations in 1998 it focused exclusively on the corn market, but has since added cotton and rice as of 2001 and 2004.  Corn and rice seeds represent the largest markets for Origin at approximately $1.6 billion each, with cotton being the smallest at $150 million.    While cotton seeds will remain a small component of Origin’s overall sales due to the size of the market, Origin has specifically stated its goal of becoming 20% of both the rice and corn markets over the next several years, which appears likely as Origin continues to grow its business both organically and through acquisitions. 
  Recently, Origin completed the acquisition of Denong Zhengcheng Seed Co., one of the largest hybrid rice companies in China, which will conservatively add between $15 - $20 million in sales in 2007.  At a valuation of $6.2 million, paid for in cash and at a multiple of sales of .41x, this accretive acquisition now establishes Origin as a meaningful operator in the hybrid rice market. Moreover, once Denong is fully integrated into Origin, further synergies should be realized as Origin applies its successful business strategy across this newly acquired platform. 
  Origin, since its inception, has focused on meeting the unique needs of the Chinese farmer.  The elements to Origin’s business strategy that have contributed to its overall success are as follows:
  Licensing of key seed technology to build its business, but emphasizing, overtime, the internal development and production of proprietary product as the core revenue component of its business.
  Devising an efficient system to effectively deal with the regulatory approval process for bringing new seeds to market.
  Having a broad base of farmers (> 60,000) to participate in the seed development process and to produce crop seeds for commercial distribution.
   Development of a distribution system that relies on a small network of primary distributors, one in each county, having exclusive rights to a particular territory.  In each territory, each primary distributor then sets up a base of secondary distributors for broader access to a market comprised roughly of 200 million farms.
  A marketing strategy used for branding Origin and its products.  The Company, as part of its strategy, uses print ads, TV advertisements, circulars, etc., to market to farmers.
  Customer service is provided to assist farmers during their growing season should they require help.  If a farmer’s problem can’t be resolved through Origin’s centralized call center, a field service representative is dispatched within 48 hours of a farmer’s call for help.
  Clearly, Origin has been successful in executing its business strategy with growth rates exceeding 35% per year since the launch of its first commercial product in 1998.  Amazingly, such success hasn’t required additional capital over and above Dr. Han’s initial investment of $400,000 and prior to Origin’s reverse merger into a SPAC, to realize such significant growth.  To accomplish this, Origin devised a system whereby distributors are required to pre-pay for 10% - 30% of their projected on order at the expected price charged by the distributor to the retailer, prior to Origin’s harvest.  Following the harvesting and packaging of seeds at Origin’s 5 processing facilities (cost of building out a facility is approximately $4 million), distributors, as they begin to call in their orders, must pay, prior to being shipped, the balance owed on each shipment made at the same price charged when orders were initially placed.  Once a distributor’s open contract has been completely filled, Origin then reimburses the distributor for their mark up, which is set between 20% - 25% of Origin’s wholesale price.  By deferring payment to its distributors, Origin’s system enables it to grow entirely through 0% distributor financing, which is how Origin has been able to achieve high double digit growth rates, historically.
    Competition:    
  Origin faces competition at several levels, ranging from several large state owned and privately held Chinese seed companies, smaller local seed companies that are extensions of the Chinese bureaucracy and several multinationals focused on both the hybrid and GMO seed market in China.  It’s estimated that 75% of the seed market in China is still controlled by state owned enterprises, while the balance is represented by several, large, privately held companies -- Origin being one of them.  While the state owned enterprises represent the bulk of a very fragmented market (5000 seed companies throughout China’s various municipalities), they are the least of Origin’s concerns as they are inefficient, under funded and likely to be acquired or assumed as further privatization and industry consolidation occurs. 
  Of the privately held companies, Origin acknowledges that it does face competition from several companies, but believes it’s only to a limited extent.  With its strong balance sheet ($30 million cash, no debt), robust proprietary pipeline of product and expansive, tiered, distribution system, Origin believes, as well as I do, that it is well positioned for continued growth, pointing out that its competition suffers from operational deficiencies that will inhibit their ability to compete effectively in the future, as it has in the past. 
  [Although I haven’t been able to confirm or verify these operational deficiencies, Origin’s success, historically, and expected, top-notch performance in 2007, support, to some extent, managements view of the competitive landscape.]
  Multinationals such as Monsanto, Pioneer and Sygenta do have a presence in China, and have had one for a number of years; however, their strategies haven’t resulted in any meaningful share of market.  Combined, as stated by Origin’s management, all three companies in 2005 shipped roughly one million kilograms of corn seed, while Origin shipped approximately fifty million kilograms.  Statements made by Origin’s management help to explain why such a disparity exists.  First, distributing $1 to $5 seed orders to half acre farms in China vs. shipping >$1 million orders to large farms in the U.S., makes for an entirely different distribution dynamic that multinationals appear to have struggled with.  Second, core to the multinationals business are GMO seeds, not hybrids, which, at the moment – with the exception of the BT cotton seed – are not allowed in China.   
  It’s expected that China will eventually open its seed market to different GMO varieties, adding further competitive pressures to companies in the Chinese market as multinationals have well established products in this space.  However, it should be noted that multinationals intend to move very slowly into this emerging GMO market, due to strong IP piracy concerns.  As such, domestic companies, like Origin, are strategically advantaged as they can begin to build their share of market, largely unencumbered by large multinationals.
  To date, Origin, with its 34% interest in Biocentury Transgene Co., Ltd. (Origin intends to own 100% of this Company over time), one of China’s leading biotechnology companies focused on developing GMO technology, is well positioned to capitalize on China’s emerging GMO market with several seeds currently under development and one seed – the BT cotton seed -- already being commercially distributed.  Monsanto has the only other BT cotton seed technology approved for commercial distribution in China.     
  Hybrid Seeds:
  Hybrid seeds are seeds produced by artificially cross-pollinated plants.  Such seeds are bred to improve the characteristics of the resulting plants, such as increased yield, greater uniformity, improved color, disease resistance, and so forth.  Today, hybrid seeds are predominant in agriculture, and are one of the primary contributing factors for the dramatic increase in agricultural output in the last half of the 20th century.
  Prior to the development of hybrid seeds, farmers relied upon the progeny (seeds) of open pollinated crops to plant the following year’s harvest, which thwarted, to a large extent, any opportunity to profit from the sale of seeds, as farmers utilized crop seeds saved from the prior year’s harvest.  This all changed however with the advent of the hybrid.  With the increase in crop yields and need to repurchase seeds on an annual basis due to lost hybrid vigor (yield) in seeds of hybrid crops, a profitable market emerged as farmers were now incentivised to purchase hybrids to benefit from increased crop production, which, in turn, resulted in increased profits as the marginal cost per additional yield was negligible.      
   Yield is the cornerstone of a farmer’s ability to profit from its harvest and is why hybrid seeds, even at their additional cost, are the Holy Grail of farming.  It’s important to note, however, that yield diminishes overtime (usually 7 years from its commercial release) as a seed’s resistance to environmental threats (disease, insects, etc.) is reduced due to general life cycle adaptations.  In order to counter such effects and insure that farm yields are always increasing, which is imperative for sustaining adequate food supplies as populations expand and land acreage from commercial development is reduced, the Chinese government mandates that for every new seed released into the market, each new seed must yield at least 8% more than a base seed (generally, the best performing seed within a province) for it to be approved for release.  Once approved, this newly released seed now represents the best yielding product within a specific geographical area and can therefore command a higher selling price.  Such yield enhancements therefore benefit the bottom lines of both seed companies and farmers.  An example will help illustrate this.
  On average, Origin sells a bag of seeds for $1.  From one bag, the average Chinese farmer makes $1000 USD profit, annually.  When Origin introduces a new seed into the market yielding 8% more than the base seed, a farmer’s profit should increase overtime by $80 – all else being equal – as the farmer incrementally allocates more and more land to this new higher yielding variety.  This, in turn, enables Origin to charge a higher price as any increase levied by the Company would be incremental to the significant increase in profitability realized by the farmer. 
  Generally, the price charged by Origin for a new seed is adjusted over its commercial life of 7 years, peaking in years three through six, following a gradual three year ramp.  In year seven, Origin either discontinues or scales back significantly a seed’s production and distribution. 
  To be clear, pricing for seeds is primarily a function of yield, with the economics of supply and demand having some impact but tending to be one sided in its effect.  If demand exceeds supply, pricing for seeds will be positively impacted, as occurred with Origin in 2003, but should supply exceed demand, its unlikely to impact pricing, as farmers will always pay up for yield.  Remember, farming is a subsidized industry in China, as it is in most parts of the world, so farmers can be assured to realize a specific level of income based on their production, which if increased as a result of yield, will only further benefit the farmer.  It can therefore be objectively stated that companies, like Origin, with a sound infrastructure, capable of bringing new seeds to market through their R&D, manufacturing and distribution platforms, will continue to prosper.
  GMO Seeds:
  Genetically modified seeds are the latest evolution in seed technology.  While GMO and hybrid seeds are processed in a similar manner, GMO seeds differ in that genetic traits, developed in a laboratory, are manually inserted into the DNA of a seed for further yield enhancement. Once inserted into the DNA, the trait becomes a permanent part of a seed’s genetic makeup (germplasm), which gets reproduced through the traditional hybrid growing process. As a result, the marginal cost of producing a GMO seed is negligible once the development cost is fully absorbed (Monsanto likes to make this point), creating a very profitable business opportunity as prices charged for GMO seeds are significantly higher than that of hybrids.  For example, Monsanto, for its Round Up Ready, Corn Bore and Root Worm products, charges between $4 to $5, $3.50 to $4.50 and $8.50 to $9.50 per half acre for these specific traits, respectively.  This is in addition to the $20 per half acre it charges for its germplasm (a.k.a hybrid seed).  Origin, on the other hand, charges between $1 to $5 for its germplasm per half acre (the disparity in price between China and the U.S. has to do with the currency conversion and general economics of producing in China) and $8 for its Bt cotton seed – its only GMO seed. 
  Clearly, the economics for GMO seeds are very compelling, representing an enormous opportunity for Origin as the Chinese government begins to lift market restrictions -- as it has done with cotton -- on other seed varieties.  As this occurs, and as the market for GMO seeds evolves, the next stage of seed development will be the stacking of multiple traits per seed, adding another layer of market opportunity to be capitalized on by Origin.
                   Government Regulation:
  The highly regulated, hybrid seed market in China requires two types of licenses: One for production and the other for distribution at the provincial or national level.  While obtaining a production license doesn’t appear to be difficult, a distribution license requires, among other things, specific levels of capital, which at the national level amounts to approximately $3,717,380.  Origin, as stated by management, is believed to be the only nationally licensed distributor in China. 
  Aside from licensing requirements, the government mandates a strict regulatory process for bringing new seeds to market, particularly at the national level.  The procedure for national examination and approval requires the applicant to:
  ·        Submit the application to the Ministry of Agriculture
  ·        Go through two cycles of monitored production in at least five different locations.  Only seeds with an 8% or higher yield compared to control seeds, ranking in the top six of all other seeds being tested in that cycle can proceed to the second year of testing.
  ·        In the second year, testing must result in one successful cycle of trial production, also in at least five different locations.  If successful, a national examination certificate is granted and a public announcement is made.
    Foreign Ownership Restrictions:
  Currently in China, foreign entities are restricted from owning more than 49% of hybrid seed companies.  Origin being a British Virgin Island Holding Company falls into this category.  To circumvent this issue and establish control over its three, primary, operating, PRC subsidiaries – Henan Origin, Denong Zhengchen and Chanchung Origin – Origin, through its 100% owned subsidiary, State Harvest, entered into stock consignment agreements with the three primary shareholders of all three PRC subsidiaries – Han Gengchen (Origin’s Chairman and CEO), Yang Yasheng (Origin’s director and COO) and Yuan Liang (Origin’s Vice Chairman).  Each consigned (pledged) their individual equity interests in each subsidiary to State Harvest, indirectly providing Origin with all the rights of ownership other than title.    For further transfer of title to occur, either fully or partially, ownership restrictions must abate or be entirely removed.
  While Origin’s unique ownership structure of its PRC subsidiaries raises some questions around the enforceability of such agreements in the event of a breach of contract, management’s counsel has indicated that Origin would have recourse if such an event were to occur.  Although the extent of legal recourse in China is difficult to measure, one should note that Origin has set up a separate100% wholly owned subsidiary, Origin Biotechnology, whereby the ownership of all seed technology, whether proprietary or licensed -- held by the PRC subsidiaries -- has been transferred to this entity for further investor protection.  Again, whether Origin can equitably enforce its rights in China remains to be seen, but management, at least, has a large vested interest (37%) in the Company’s success, aligning their interests with that of all shareholders.
  Valuation:
  Origin is currently trading at an enterprise value of $275 million and at a multiple of sales and earnings of 4.6x and 25x, respectively, based on recently re-affirmed fiscal year end estimates for 2006.  While these multiples on a trailing twelve month basis appear out of the range of what I would consider a value investment, conservative 2007 estimates indicate otherwise. 
  For fiscal 2007, I expect Origin to generate $100 million in sales based on the following assumptions: $78 million in organic sales (30% year over year growth rate), plus $15 million in sales from the Denong acquisition, plus $5 million in sales from Origin’s 34% interest in the Changrong joint venture (I realize that this amount won’t reflect in sales, but I’ve included it as part of my projection).  As such, Origin’s current EV/Sales multiple should adjust to 2.75x down from 4.6x. 
  Margins for 2007, while harder to forecast, should be between 15% - 20% (Origin’s three year historical range), which should persist as Origin continues to bring higher yielding, higher priced product to market.  Using this earnings range, Origin’s EV/E multiple should be between 18x – 14x vs. its trailing twelve month multiple of 25x.
   Based on the adjusted multiples, it appears that Origin is undervalued on both a relative and PEG basis, providing a reasonable margin of safety that should limit one’s downside risk.  First, on a relative basis, Origin EV/S ratio of 2.75x falls short of the acquisition multiples paid for top-tiered, state-side seed companies.  Two examples of this are Seminis and Delta & Pine Land.  Seminis, an unprofitable and highly levered company, was purchased by Monsanto in 2005 for about 2.9x EV/S; Delta and Pine Land Co, a well managed and profitable company, is in the process of being acquired by Monsanto for roughly 3.3x EV/S. While both companies are similar to Origin in that each is well positioned within their respective markets, they differ entirely from a growth perspective.
  Organic growth for Origin continues at high double digit rates (30+%), while growth for Seminis and Delta and Pine Land Co are in the low to mid single digits, as the bulk of their sales come from mature markets -- this is also true for Monsanto and Syngenta.  As such, there’s a divergence between the PEG ratios of Origin and its peer group.  Where Monsanto, Syngenta and Delta and Pine Land Co (Seminis is excluded as it was acquired in 2005) trade at ratios of approximately 1.9x, 1.4x and 4.0x, respectively, Origin trades at a discounted multiple of roughly .71x.  While this discount may be justified in situations where future growth is constrained, Origin’s growth rate per year is likely to exceed 30% through 2009 and beyond, as management is well incentivised and market consolidation is likely to continue.
   As part of Origin’s valuation, one needs to fully understand management’s incentive plan, as it is dilutive.  The performance plan enables management to receive an additional 1.5 million shares per year, over the next 3 years, if they’re able to achieve 38% CAGR in earnings through 2009.  This breaks down as follows:
  ·        2007 - $16 million
·        2008 - $21 million
·        2009 - $29 million
  If achieved, this represents total dilution of 20%, assuming no share repurchases over the next three years (management has already authorized a $10 million share repurchase program).  While this is significant, and likely alarming to many investors, I don’t find it to be entirely unreasonable.  If earnings can be increased at a 38% CAGR over this period, with Origin’s EV/E multiple remaining at its current level of 25x, an investor should realize a compounded annual return of 24%.  Even if Origin’s EV/E falls to 15x, which is unlikely at such high growth rates, a CARR of 6% would likely result.  At such growth rates, I would expect Origin to increase its current market share from 2% to 6% through 2009, with a remaining 14% to be realized, as Origin has a stated goal of achieving a 20% share of market. 
  Beyond 2009, dilution should adjust to reasonable levels as the current management incentive plan will have expired.  I expect the board to provide additional incentives following the expiration of this plan, but anything approved would be far less dilutive than what’s currently in place, as the original plan was really an earn-out provision enacted at the time of the reverse merger.  So beyond 2009, dilution rates should be reduced significantly, while the bulk of Origin’s expected growth still remains – a formula I am comfortable with.
  Accounting Issues:
  Origin has two accounting issues it must currently contend with: Revenue recognition and its fiscal year end audit for 2006.  While its always a concern when accounting issues surface, it should be stressed that there are reasonable explanations for the above items.
  The issue of revenue recognition has to do primarily with how Origin sells to its distributors.  As was explained earlier, distributors are required to pay for all shipments upfront at the estimated “retail” price charged to the farmer.  Only after a distributor has been shipped its entire on order, following the October to June selling cycle, are they reimbursed by Origin for their share of the profits, based on their average selling price over this period.  Because the final selling price can’t be established until the end of a distributor’s selling cycle, all interim sales made by Origin must be accounted for as deferred revenues, as required by its accounting firm, Deloitte Touche.  As a result, deferred revenues at the end of calendar year 2005 jumped considerably, alarming many investors.
  Management addressed this issue with Deloitte Touche, arguing that such conservative accounting is unreasonable when the final selling price, set by its distributors, deviates very little from the estimated price established at the start of the selling cycle, which management claims is supportable on an historical basis.  Management further states that when accounting for deferred revenues, they provide for a 5% allowance to capture any possible dilution related to the final selling price and/or returns -- which they believe is very conservative.  As a result of this disagreement, management has since decided to change accounting firms for 2007, and will be using BDO McCable, a BDO International member firm.  Management hasn’t disclosed if this change will alter how revenues are accounted for.
   Deloitte Touche is currently working on completing Origin’s delayed 2006 fiscal year end audit.  Much of the delay, it appears, stems from the Denong acquisition made earlier in the year.  Apparently, the hold up is due to indecisiveness on the part of the auditor in deciding which year Denong’s revenues should be recognized in, based on its calendar 2005 results, as Origin is on a fiscal year.  With Origin’s recently re-affirmed guidance for fiscal 2006, it appears that Denong’s revenues will be excluded from Origin’s year end numbers.  With this apparently resolved, Origin has now confirmed that the audit will be completed before the end of December.
  Conclusion:
  From a risk/return profile, I believe the investment case for Origin breaks down very simply: The upside opportunity outweighs the downside risk.   To recap:
  ·        Origin at its current enterprise value is trading at 14x – 18x expected 2007 earnings, with an anticipated growth rate in excess of 30%, in a fragmented, yet consolidating, industry, with very favorable economics, not only in China, but globally as well.
  ·         Origin’s core business currently accounts for 2% of the Chinese seed market, increasing to 3% in 2007 and a projected 6% by 2009 – not unreasonable when one considers that only three companies -- Monsanto, Pioneer and Syngenta -- account for most of the seed sales that occur outside of China.    
  ·        Management and shareholders have aligned interests with management owning 37% of Origin’s stock.
  ·        Management is well incentivised to achieve its projections with their rich earn-out plan.
  There are many more highlights that could be included but these four appear to standout.  Now to recap several of the risks:
  ·        Execution risk is of some concern, but at Origin’s current valuation the downside appears limited.
  ·        Political risk is obviously a concern, but with large foreign investments being made in China’s banking industry -- its most regulated industry -- I’m less concerned with an investment in a hybrid seed company.
  ·        Further accounting risk is of marginal concern, but it still exists.
  In general, the opportunity to invest in what could potentially be the next Monsanto of China certainly compensates for any of the associated risks one could encounter investing in China, especially at Origin’s discounted valuation.
    Catalyst
Origin Agritech Limited, I believe, is one of the more interesting, long-term, investment opportunities I’ve come across to date. Currently trading at a multiple of fiscal 2006 (yr. end Sept. 30) sales of 4.6x and an estimated 2.75x 2007 sales, Origin is conservatively priced based on its growth potential within an industry where acquisition multiples for market leaders have been between 2.9x to 3.3x sales. As one of the first privately held and now premier, branded, hybrid, seed, companies in China, Origin is positioned to capitalize on this very fragmented, highly profitable, high barrier to entry, regulated market.",-33.761328556548456,-39.72809159330577,-53.39878881627518,-49.848939133794005,4.225637537375045,8.896820820131204,3.6165672555560517,0.1813665878257765

Thesis
SELL.  BKE is a broken growth story trading at $54, or almost 16x FYE Jan. 2014 P/E and 8.2x FY’14 EV/EBITDA.  Declining comparable store sales and sales per square ft., lack of store growth opportunities, increasing competition, peak margins and a declining macro environment for mall based apparel retailers lend this stock to be worth closer to 12x FY2014 $3.47 (essentially flat eps growth) or about $41 (24% downside).  There are a number of issues facing BKE that are unlikely to be resolved in the next few quarters including continued margin deterioration as the ability to raise AUR declines, increased competition, and  weakening macro environment which is further hurting sales.  Like its other mall-based teen peers, BKE will in the long term see a permanent decline in its OPM as current margins are just not sustainable.  Assuming a decline in OPM to 18% (which I believe is generous) and still significantly above its peer group including URBN (now at 13% but once at 20%), EPS drops to $2.82. A weaker margin profile would lower the multiple, putting BKE more inline w/ peers such as AEO and ANF. At 12x that new EPS, BKE would be a $33 stock, almost 40% downside from today’s levels.
Investment Highlights
Maturing Domestic Retail Business:
BKE has few opportunities to grow its store base given that it has almost 500 locations
While management claims to have not studied its store productivity, it appears that the newer locations in the NE area have not gained traction forcing them to depend on their core Midwest business
In the last five years, store base has gone from 387 to 440. Within the last two years, BKE has only had square footage growth of 2%.
No new concepts in the works – and any new concepts would clearly come with risk
Extremely Weak Social Media Presence and Ecommerce Channel:
For most retailers, ecommerce is a huge driver (at least double digit growth), especially as most are growing off a low base but BKE is seeing very weak ecommerce sales. Growth of only 6% in Q1 on top of a meager 15%.
Ecommerce growth peaked in FY10 at 45% and has then been in the low 20s and now single digits
Ecommerce is the highest margin business in retail and BKE is unable to capitalize on it versus peers such as URBN where ecommerce is a huge sales and margin driver
The next generation is all about mobile and e-commerce and in the long run without a strong e-commerce presence, this does not bode well for the company’s future
Google trends for Buckle store peaked in December 2010 and is going nowhere to down versus up and over for strong growth brand such as kate spade or Michael Kors
Only 356k likes on Facebook vs. 9.1M for AEO, 7.7m for ANF, 1.8M for URBN
Target demographic is 18-25 y.o. – yet internet/social media presence is extremely weak 
Deteriorating Comparable Store Sales and Margins:
Comparable Store Sales
Comparable Store Sales (SSS) have been very inconsistent the last 12-18 months essentially peaking in February 2012 (at the high single digits) to a low single digits ever since with even a few negative months.  Should this trend continue which we think it will, it will eventually hit GM as BKE needs at least a msd sss to leverage buying and occupancy costs.
Margins
BKE is at peak OPM in the low 20s vs. most peers in the mid-teens or even hsd
About 1/3 of the business is private label, helping to drive margin improvement but also increasing fashion, design and manufacturing risk; however when compared to other mall-based peers (ANF, AEO, ARO, CHS, ANN – etc. are all 100% private label and have lower operating margins)
BKE has managed to maintain GM through increases in merchandise margins and by reductions in incentive compensation.  Most of the increase in merchandise margins has come from increasing AUR, with msd to even low dd increases at the end of CY2011 and into CY12.  Now going CY13, we are seeing that trend decrease AUR’s flat to even down in the last couple of months. 
Margins also benefited in the fall of 2012 from the steep reduction in cotton costs on a year over year basis from 2011. Since denim is 45% of BKE’s sales, they were one of the greatest beneficiaries of this product cost decrease. However, going into fall of 2013, the cost benefit will anniversary and we are starting to see a slow rise in cotton prices again.
A quick analysis of BKE’s margin profile indicates that if its OPM falls to even 18% (significantly higher than well run operator URBN (13.4% FYE Jan 2013) and almost double other specialty retailers such as ANF (8.3% FYE Jan 2013), EPS would drop $2.82 to for FYE Jan 2014 vs. $3.47, an almost 20% drop   
Other Warning Signs:
Management does not give guidance and provides very little information on its conference call.
Management’s answers to questions, particularly about store productivity are vague and dismissive. What management team in the retail business hasn’t studied it store productivity, product costs or has really tried to figure out why its ecommerce business is lagging? If management hasn’t taken the time to study it, it’s likely they won’t be able to fix it either.
   On Nov. 2012 Q3’12 earnings conference call, analyst Paul Alexander asked a question about productivity of retail stores separate from online and again management answered, “I can’t say that I’ve studied that well enough to be able to give a good comment on that.”
   On March 2013 Q4’12 earnings conference call, again sell-side analyst Paul Alexander asked how much of the 20bps improvement in merchandise margin was from lower product costs.  Management’s answer was “I don’t know that I’ve studied it well enough to say…”
Insiders continue to sell the stock in droves – obviously this does not show confidence
Competition is growing:
BKE is facing an increasing competitive environment.
Other Specialty Retailers:  
Specialty retailers like AEO, ANF and URBN are actively marketing and competing w/ the BKE for market share and share of wallet. This often includes steep discounting and markdowns.  The mall “being on sale” makes it difficult for any one player, especially in the key 18-22 y.o. demographic to continue to play without offering competitive pricing.
Fast Fashion:
New fast fashion players like H&M, Zara, Forever 21, and Uniqlo are continuing to build out their store bases and able to offer trend-right fashion at entry-level opening price points that specialty retailers such as BKE cannot match.  This teen demographic is extremely fickle and trying to get the most bang for its buck. 
Ecommerce
As mentioned above, ecommerce is the future of retail and seemingly all retail players are working on building out there ecommerce/Omni channel platforms. Even the worst players are seeing strong growth in ecommerce except for BKE.  Competitors such as URBN have made ecommerce a keen focus on their future growth and believe it will eventually be larger than its brick and mortar store business.
Outlets
Outlets used to be located far away from the cities – maybe 45-60 miles away.  Increasingly outlets are moving closer to cities and regional malls, placing increased competition on typical mall-based retailers who are competing with themselves at the outlet channel as well as high end retailers with stronger brands and steeper discounts to full price.
Why now?
Continued weak comparable store sales, slow store growth, increased competition and weak ecommerce sales
Valuation
Almost 16x FYE Jan 14 EPS of $3.47 is too expensive for company with slowing growth/(actually no growth), potentially weakening margins and the headwind of weaker mall traffic.  BKE’s cash balance and one-time special dividends are not enough to justify a premium valuation to the group as peers such as AEO and ARO are also sitting on almost half their market caps in cash and are trading at 12x.   BKE should get a multiple more in line with its current growth rate or 13x FYE 13 or about $41 per share.  The downside could be considerably more in the longer run as we believe operating margins will normalize at much lower levels.
Risks
Large cash balance – could do special dividend, increase regular dividend or a share repurchase; although they had done a larger than unusual special div last year ahead of changes to tax law
Heavily shorted name (20% of float); could result in short squeeze in spite of poor financial performance
I do not hold a position of employment, directorship, or consultancy with the issuer.
Neither I nor others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

2019-11-20,NPComplete,CMPR,Cimpress,https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/Cimpress/7952839007,3900000000.0,137.0,"Description
Executive Summary: Cimpress (NASDAQ: CMPR) is an extremely compelling short with 50% downside from today’s level of ~$137/sh, just a couple percent off its 52-wk high. Competition has significantly increased in the last couple of years as barriers to entry have been removed and the Company has failed to invest in technology and innovation to keep up. This is demonstrated in all-time high costs for SEM, credit card data showing CMPR new customer growth -30% yoy, and Google Trends indicating considerable loss of interest from consumers relative to competitors. The stock has increased >50% over the last few months on negligible incremental news, all because the Company has been in the open market every day buying almost 20% of the daily liquidity indiscriminately. The #1 shareholder (15% ownership, Board seat) sold $100m of stock in recent weeks, calling into question how much higher insiders think the stock can run ahead of underlying fundamentals. The Company is overearning today (margins >40% higher than well-funded competitors) and drastically cutting marketing spend, which will soon translate into an evaporating topline. Finally, after the massive buybacks, leverage levels are now less than 1x from breaching their covenant and will become an issue as EBITDA peaks this year (from lapping the advertising cuts) and starts to decline thereafter.
Description: Cimpress created the online mass customization printing space, targeting SMBs in the United States. It has since expanded to Europe and other countries and grown from its core business card offering to brochures, pamphlets, invitations, calendars, signage, etc. CMPR remains the largest player, but the space has become highly competitive with several well-funded competitors including 4Imprint, Minted, and Zazzle among others.
Insider Signals: The crux of this short thesis is around competition, but there are several other factors that make this a very attractive entry point, including the largest shareholder selling $100m worth of stock in recent weeks for the first meaningful sale in the 8yrs that they have been a holder (also have a Board seat on the 5-person Board). This is a signal we have found to be quite meaningful in other stocks we have taken positions in. The top 5 shareholders (including the CEO with 12%) control 60% of the stock and the Board, and operate the Company as a semi-private entity (no quarterly earnings calls, very limited sell-side coverage).
The stock went from $120 to $80 in January ’19 as the Company missed expectations with Vistaprint (>50% of revs / core U.S. SMB online customization platform) organic growth slowing from LDD/HSD in prior years to 3% in their FQ2’19. The Company announced a restructuring/transformation program with severe cuts to advertising/marketing expenses and a focus on the core business after several acquisitions. The stock languished in the $80-$100 range until CMPR initiated (we found out in their FQ1’20 filing on 10/31/19) a huge buyback program, swallowing almost 10% of shares outstanding / 15% of actual float (>2.5m shs) in the open market in a matter of 3mths (August-October). It is no coincidence that the stock went from $100 to $140 over the exact same time frame with no incremental news about the Company given this means that the Company’s buybacks accounted for 18% of the average daily trading volume in an already illiquid stock. According to the 2019 Proxy, management’s long-term incentive plan is solely based on stock price appreciation (not tied to any fundamental metrics). Beginning this year, the CEO receives no cash salary (except for legal minimum) or cash bonus and is now solely compensated on the performance of the stock price.
Competition: Overall industry growth has been and will continue to be +LSD-MSD as price competition offsets volume growth that is supported by low unemployment and a long-running bull market. There are legitimate and well-funded competitors in the space: Moo.com (~$200m sales), Minted (Forbes, Jan. ‘19 – “annual revenues are increasing 39% year-over-year, into the low hundreds of millions… In December, T. Rowe Price and the European private equity firm Permira ploughed an additional $208 million into Minted, bringing its total money raised to nearly $300 million. The company’s valuation is $733 million”), and 4Imprint (LSE: FOUR; $800m sales, growing high-teens) and are all growing topline +high-teens. Highly correlated with gross adds, Google Search trends are +HSD-20% for each of these competitors versus CMPR down -MSD-HSD.
  Credit card data shows CMPR’s new customer growth fell off a cliff when they stepped off the gas on advertising spend and are currently running down >-30% yoy. Sales per customer have increased in the same time frame, but at less than half the rate of new customer declines.
   Since CMPR first defined the space and enjoyed low SEM / search advertising costs, widely available capital has lowered the barriers to entry and e-commerce standards have risen significantly. From CMPR’s 2019 Annual Report (Risk Factor Section): “The use of mobile devices skyrocketed, but customization on small screens is difficult, hurting our conversion rates. Competitive pressure has increased steadily for both price levels and advertising. The economic expansion that has continued for the last ten years has increased input costs for paper and shipping services.”
 4Imprint Case Study: There is a little-known public competitor called 4Imprint listed in London ($1bn mkt cap) although the business is overwhelmingly derived from North America. Four sales have consistently been growing >mid-teens. They reported 1H ’19 +17% vs. their call-out of the US market growing 4-5%, so they are very clearly taking share. They reported orders +14% yoy, implying pricing down ~3% yoy. An analyst who covers them: “The Company looks to maintain margins in a comparatively tight band underpinned by its considerable ability to set prices appropriately; at the same time using analytic tools to determine the best use of marketing investment, maximizing its ability to grow sales strongly.” FOUR’s shareholder letter also laid out the case for increasing marketing spend: “…We were confident in our direction, but uncertain of the timeframe over which brand based advertising would produce meaningful revenue benefits… In addition, we were careful to point out that this investment would be incremental and as such would not involve a re-allocation of funds away from our existing, proven marketing engine. In consequence, we guided to 2018 numbers showing continued revenue growth but flat year-on-year operating profit…” Just as powerful, excess profits are reinvested to maintain 6-7% EBITA margins (vs. CMPR >10%):
  Contrary to the CMPR business trends, customers acquired at FOUR are up strongly yoy in Q1 & Q2 ‘19:
  Advertising Cuts: CMPR is overearning, at peak ROICs today driven by significant marketing spend cuts which have not had time to translate through to top-line and profit erosion. They were a first-mover and reaped the benefits of low-cost digital marketing, but those days are now over. Advertising spend is required to attract new customers to offset the high churn of existing microbusinesses, especially in a customer segment where there is full price transparency as all shopping is done online. This is a business with [Company-stated] a 30% annual retention rate, not an easy business from the start. From a former employee that we spoke with: “It is truly a risk if they cut that marketing too far because the space is very crowded. Quality of the product they produce isn’t that great that somebody else can't do the exact same thing… The nature of the marketplace points to the reality that Vistaprint will continue to decline. New players are coming in and people want something different.” The Company will not see the same growth and margins as a few years ago as the acquisition of customers has grown significantly more competitive. Bullish estimates call for FY20 to be the revenue trough and then re-accelerate to MSD+ with margin expansion. This makes little sense for anyone who is paying attention.
Q1FY20 (10/30/19) Takeaways: The Company just reported earnings that help solidify the short thesis:
1.      Growth in EBITDA driven by advertising cuts (will be a near/medium-term top-line headwind) and one-off benefits from (i) currency derivatives, (ii) restructuring addbacks, and (iii) M&A. Yet, still missed SunTrust estimate by -$12m / -13%:
2.      On a 2yr stack, organic growth decelerated in every single business line
3.      Vistaprint technology still a major work in progress: “Vistaprint's technology team is making steady progress on the multi-year project to rebuild Vistaprint's technology infrastructure… caution that we remain only in the very early stages of this technology development process, and we do not expect launch in our largest (U.S.) market prior to Q3 of FY2021.”
4.      Signs of concern about new customer growth: “In September 2019, Vistaprint tested and rolled out an offer of free standard shipping on all business card orders in the U.S. market…We expect to test similar offers in other geographies over the remainder of the fiscal year.”
5.      No intro needed: “We continue to see very aggressive price competition and online search competition in the upload and print space in Europe. We are committed to defending our price and marketing leadership positions, including continuing price reductions which we have implemented in the recent past. This negatively impacts our revenue and EBITDA, but we are prepared to maintain this defensive stance indefinitely because we believe that, over the long term, it is in the best interests of our customers and our cost structure should allow us to outlast the competition.”
Where we could be wrong: if the Company is able to scale back ad spend and also re-accelerate growth over a meaningful measurement period (~12mths), then we are wrong here. However, given what we know about the industry and how far behind CMPR is from a technology and innovation perspective, this is far more unlikely than a case of eroding margins and top-line accelerating negatively.
Valuation: The Company is really only covered on the sell side by one analyst and he allocates little to no time to this given that the analyst’s coverage includes Amazon, Alphabet, Uber, Peloton, Facebook, Snapchat, and 18 other tech companies that drive more investor interest. Despite the giant miss in FQ1, the review still labeled the quarter as an “operational improvement”. He has a legacy model and put his numbers under review after Q1. He brought down his 2021 EBITDA number by -9% last week.
With deteriorating topline and EBITDA declines after FY20, not to mention increasing competition and heightened execution risks after leveraging the Company up to buyback stock, this business does not deserve a double-digit earnings multiple. My base case has -37% downside and the Bear/Bull cases skew -3.5/1.
  Additionally, I ran two different DCFs to sanity check my assumptions. The first was my realistic base case for the Company. Note that they did $210m of normalized FCF in FY19, so my Yr10 of $227m is conservative in my opinion (including assigning them a positive perpetual growth rate), and I still think there is 50% downside:
My second DCF was a WYNTB [“What you need to believe”] to back into today’s price (frequently advocated by the widely respected Michael Mauboussin). The market is pricing in +2-3% topline growth and expanding margins from ~14% today to high-teens a few years out, not to mention more efficient capex spending. Head-scratching.
I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.
Catalyst
Top-line accelerates negatively as the credit card data and google search trends indicate. 
The Company re-invests in marketing and margins subsequently fall to the industry-level (-40% below CMPR today) at which point leverage becomes a real issue (~2.4x today versus 3.25x Sr Lvg covenant and ~3.3x today versus 4.75x Total Lvg covenant).",-15.076589991347788,-41.6192579487603,-37.709702608329046,-24.82859739569989,8.423144625161362,-4.971916986877106,16.678675539880928,32.30024036596197

Short Seaboard Corp
Originally written up by Mark778 in August 2005 (which I highly recommend reading as well ), Seaboard Corp owns a wide variety of businesses including pork production/processing in the US, container shipping in Latin America, commodity milling and trading in Africa, sugar and citrus production in Argentina, electric power in the Dominican Republic, and jalapeno peppers in Honduras. While the variety businesses looks intimidating from an analytical perpective, pork and marine are the critical divisions to understand as together they comprise 82% of the 2006 EBIT and their strong results have been the major drivers of the company’s recent outperformance. For the last 3 years, margins in both the pork and marine business have been far above the trend for the rest of the last decade. If one believed that current results were sustainable, then SEB would probably be fairly valued at 8x current EBITDA. However, I believe it is likely that both pork and marine margins are unsustainable. Furthermore, I believe that pork margins will decline significantly in 2007, driven by rapidly increasing feed costs (corn). This pork margin decline should lead to a drop in overall earnings, removing the earnings momentum from the stock and driving it to a more appropriate valuation, even if marine earnings stay strong. Assuming only my expected decline in pork profitability and continued strong marine performance, I would argue that the stock is worth no more than $1,850 at 12x EPS, a 28% decline from today. However, if the marine business also reverts back towards normal profitability, then I would argue that SEB is worth $1,390, a 46% decline from the current share price.
Short Positives
- Major businesses are extremely cyclical commodity businesses that have recently operated well above historical norms. Normalization should bring significant margin downside
o Pork and marine division operating margins far above historical norms during last 3 years.

- Valuation ludicrous on previous margin achievements. If margins normalize, downside could be significant.

BUSINESS DESCRIPTIONS
Pork
Seaboard’s pork division is a vertically integrated pork producer (=raise) and processor (=kill). The company produces and sells fresh, frozen, and processed pork products to further processors, foodservice operators, retail outlets, and distributors throughout the US and internationally. SEB owns hog breeding and production facilities in OK, KS, TX and CO and can produce approximately 3.8mln hogs annually, internally supplying 80% of the company’s processing needs. For processing SEB can process 16k hogs in its core Guymon, OK facility and owns two bacon processing plants in UT and MT. SEB also markets related pork products for Triumph Foods LLC for a per head fee.

Competition
Seaboard is the #3 pork producer and #7 pork processor in the nation with ~4% mkt share in each segment. Pork production is a very fragmented industry with the top ten producers controlling only 1/3 of the market. This fragmentation (combined with the high fertility rate of hogs) has led to significant pricing volatility and cyclicality in this industry. Pork processing is a more stable and concentrated market (although lower margin) with the top ten processors handling over 90% of pork in the US. Smithfield Foods is the mkt leader in both pork production and processing and has widened its mkt lead by buying competitor Premium Standard recently.

Outlook
The pork business has been extremely strong during 2004-6, driven by a booming export market. According to the US Meat export federation (www.usmef.org), US pork exports have increased at an 67% from 2003-6, driven by strong demand from Mexico, (28% of exports, up 62% 2003-06) South Korea (9% of exports, up 378%) and Japan (27% of exports, up 25%) as those countries dramatically decreased their beef consumption (US beef exports down 49% 2003-6) following the outbreak of mad cow disease in the US. In 2007, Japanese and Korean export demand for US pork has remained strong. However, in recent weeks, both Japan and Korea have begun to take steps towards easing their restrictions on US beef, suggesting that the continued substitution of pork for beef may have less of an impact on exports going forward. Furthermore, pork export tons fell 2.4% in February 2007, only the second month to be below the year earlier since August 2003, suggesting that previous surges in pork exports may not continue.
More importantly, the pork business faces a significant threat from the recent large, ethanol-driven increase in corn prices. As corn equals ~50% of the total costs of raising a hog (feed costs= ~75% and corn is 66% of feed costs), the almost doubling of corn prices in early 2007 should dramatically pressure prices. This theory has been supported by agricultural economists who worry that rising corn prices will dramatically hurt pork producer profitability.  (http://www.farmdoc.uiuc.edu/marketing/livestockoutlook/html/041007/041007.html)
SEB will gain some relief from increasing hog prices, but according to the USDA, live hog prices have only increased 8% in Q1 07 vs. Q1 06, not enough to offset the dramatic increase in corn prices. Furthermore, hog producers continue to increase production (USDA expects pork production to increase 2% in 2007, limiting pricing gains.
While SEB does not break out hog production and hog processing separately, by looking at competitor Smithfield’s breakdown, it becomes quite apparent that a large driver of pork division margin outperformance over the last few years is due to the hog production division (SFD hog production has generated OPMs from the high teens to the low 20s over the last 10 quarters while processing margins have been low to mid single digits). However, hog production margins should decline significantly due to the significant increase in raising costs driven by dramatic increases in corn prices. Competitor Premium Standard Foods (recently acquired by Smithfield), said that hog production operating margins declined from 12.2% to 3.9% for Dec qtr 06 vs. Dec 05, primarily due to a 31.5% increase in the cost of corn. Smithfield’s margins declined to 1.1% in the Jan 07 qtr vs. 14.9% in the Jan qtr 2006 and management commented on the most recent CC that high corn prices were going to pressure future margins. During Q1 07, SEB’s pork margins declined from 12.3% to 8.7%, with the company blaming high corn prices for the drop in margins. I believe that this margin decline will continue throughout 2007.

Marine
SEB’s marine division provides containerized shipping between 25 countries in the US, Caribbean, and Central and South America. The company’s fleet consists of 11 owned and 28 chartered vessels. The segment time charters or the majority of its fleet and is profitability is impacted by containership rates, charter hire rates and fuel costs, among other things.
While not much information exists about the company’s marine segment Mgmt has commented on the likely unsustainable profitability in the Marine segment:
“Although management cannot predict changes in future
cargo rates, fuel related costs, charter hire expenses or to what
extent changes in competition and economic conditions will impact
net sales or operating income, it does expect this segment to
remain profitable in 2007 although lower than 2006.”
Furthermore, given the expected 15% increase in containership capacity for 2007, it is quite possible that container shipping rates will weaken going forward. However, I have not assumed any significant weakness in marine margins going forward as I do not believe I have enough information to forecast a margin decline in this business.

Commodity Milling
SEB markets grain and oilseed products mainly in Africa, South America, and the Caribbean with locations in 15 countries. The division sources, transports and markets over 3mln tons of wheat, corn, soybean meal, and other related commodities for use as food and animal feed. SEB also owns 25 grain processing locations capable of producing 1.5mln tons of finished product/yr.
As segment sales are significantly affected by fluctuating prices for various commodities including wheat, corn and soybean meal, a dramatic increase in the price of grains could hurt the company’s sales and or margins as the company attempts to pass on these higher input costs. Thus, I would argue that rising grain prices could lead to lower 2007 operating profit in the commodity milling division.

Other Businesses
Sugar and Citrus-SEB is also involved in the production and refining of sugar and the production and processing of citrus products in Argentina and markets these products mainly locally with some exports to the US, South America, and Europe. SEB’s mill currently has processing capacity of 200k metric tons of sugar and 4mln gallongs of alcohol per year. The company also owns 50k acres of sugar cane and 3k acres used for orange trees. During 2006, SEB benefited from rising global sugar prices, which more than offset the loss making citrus operations. This division is significantly impacted by local and global sugar prices. I expect continued strong performance out of this division as sugar prices are likely to remain high driven by ethanol demand.
Electric Power-SEB owns two floating electric diesel power generating facilities in the Dominican Republic with 112 megawatts of rated capacity. The company operates as an IPP sells electricity with 50% under contract to large commercial users under LT contracts and on the spot market to 3 govt controlled distribution companies as well as other customers. During 2006, SEB’s power production was restricted by the DR regulatory authorities, which schedule power production based on the amt of funds available to pay for the power produced and the costs of that power. SEB is also part of a consortium to build two coal-fired 305mw electricity generating plants in the DR. SEB has a less than 50% interest and expects to spend between 25 and 75mln.
Others- SEB produces jalapeno peppers in Honduras and has a equity investment in a Bulgarian wine business. These businesses are not that meaningful for overall results.

Mgmt
SEB is controlled by the secretive Bresky family through their private Seaboard Flour company. The family makes ever effort who make every attempt to avoid publicity. However, a 1998 Time article (also noted by Mark) suggests that their level of ethics is not the highest. Most notable from the article, is the information about a 1990 lawsuit by shareholder Alfred Kahn, which alleges a high level of self dealing between Seaboard Corp and privately traded Seaboard Flour. “Robohm was subpoenaed in the Kahn lawsuit, and he recited a litany of business dealings in which, he said, Bresky had interests in companies that profited from inflated contracts with Seaboard Corp. According to his deposition, kickbacks were paid to officials in foreign governments; contracts were padded, with the excess money diverted to Swiss bank accounts; management fees were inflated; brokerage commissions ran 2 1/2 to five times the usual rate. And in the case of one Seaboard subsidiary, ""there was a great deal of cash that was...unaccounted for."" The Breskys settled the Kahn lawsuit for $10.8mln without admitting any wrongdoing.[i]
Conclusion
I think its best to give the CEO of SEB the last word about the cyclicality of the company’s operations:
“Since 2004, we have cautioned that these operating results are
extraordinary, and that going forward, we expect to return to
normalized levels of profitability which are more in line with
our commodity-driven businesses.”
“We have had a remarkable run over the last three years…since the beginning of 2004, our combined operating income has exceed our previous 25 years combined… and our stock price has appreciated over 500%. It would be nice to consider these highlights as reflecting a trend, but, realistically, it is more likely that they reflect a spike within a trend.”[ii]

Goodyear is a global leader of automobile tyre manufacturer with a new management team that took over in 2003 and has been doing a terrific job of cutting cost and turning despite difficult raw material cost challenges. If the management just modestly succeeds in improving its North America operating margin to 3.5% (vs. the management target @4-5%) by '07 from today's just under 2.5%, which would be still well below the peer group average of 6%, based on my conservative '07 NA revenue estimate of roughly $9BN, Goodyear could produce an incremental pretax earnings of over $135mm [=NA revenue @$9BN x margin improvement btw. 05-07 @ 100BP => $90 mm], or approximately $0.40+ per share (no tax due to $1BN NOL and on 215mm shrs o/s est. by 07). Added onto '05 EPS estimate of $1.60-1.70, it would produce '07 earnings power estimate of at minimum $2.00 per share. At a reasonable P/E multiple of 12-13x, the stock could rise to low-20 to mid-20 in 12 months. Each 10bp further margin improvement beyond the level I've assumed could drive incremental EPS of 4-5c/shr, or $0.5-1.0/shr incremental value.

I'll save the details about the industry and competitive landscape as such info can be easily available in GT's and its competitors' regulatory filings. Main competitors are Michellin and Bridgestone. Nevetheless, it's important to point out more than 70% of total demand is driven by replacement tires. Replacement demand is relatively stable as it is impacted by driving mileages. The rule of thumb is, since avg. life of a tire is four years old, each car need to replace one tire each year. Higher gasoline price could hurt replacement demand as people drive less but there has yet been any evidence proving that even during the most recent hurricane season that drove up retail gasoline price above $4/gallon in NE.


Good management/sound strategy

· During my most recent visit to their HQ in I met Bob Keegan (Chairman & CEO), Richard Kramer (EVP & CFO), Jon Rich (President of NA Tire) – all very impressive; honest and smart guys.
· At heart of GT’s turnaround strategy is marketing, which is be executing by a group of competent managers who all have consumer marketing background
o Key managers all have consumer product background
§ CEO – Eastman Kodak consumer product group
§ President of NA Tire operation – GE
§ President of Europe & Latin America – both from consumer product companies like P&G

· A big culture change within the organization since 2001 has led to

1) a strategy that is focused on winning share in targeted market;
2) a business portfolio whose mix is increasingly shifting towards high-end/high-performance tires;
3) a renewed focus of R&D effort that is accelerating new product rollout pace even though total R&D spending has not risen as much as its competitors have
o Previously, like every other tire company, GT just wanted to fill its capacity by producing as much as it can but paid no attention to customer needs. Dealers once complained GT had no new product and its marketing campaign had no impact on sales.
o Now, GT only participates in the categories that are identified to have profitable growth prospect and/or provide differentiating characteristics => sustained growth platform and opportunity to improve margin.
§ For example, in the OEM business, GT has intentionally exited from some businesses. The percentage of OEM business as of the total portfolio is now down to 28-29% from 32% five years ago. The remaining OEM contracts are all required to bring in significant replacement revenue, which is a more profitable business. DCX is now the largest OEM customer, followed by Ford and GM. But GM exposure is believed to be not significant.
§ Another example: truck business was ignored by the old management but now it has become an important pillar to GT’s growth story
o Trucks currently account for only 8% of volume but represent 20% of revenue
o Due to mining and construction boom worldwide, truck capacity is currently maxed out for both GT and its competitors, therefore giving GT tremendous pricing power in this category – each 10% truck tire price increase => 2% overall price increase eve with flat prices for the rest 80% of revenue, a very important piece of GT’s pricing increases.
· CEO’s own assessment of GT’s turnaround effort so far
o At a scale from 0 to 10, GT has come back from probably negative 2 (meaning previously bad enough to be even below 0 or the lowest-end of a normal range) to currently 4-5;
o CEO doesn’t believe to get to 10 from here is more difficult than getting to 4-5 from 0
§ The key reason is people
· Management change has been completed on all the levels
· Positive momentum is built and accelerating and team spirit is high
· By contrast, back in 2001 morale was low and negative issues such as liquidity problems needed to be addressed
· Indication of next step restructuring (details could be found on the company's website from its September analyst meeting presentation)
o More cost cutting in NA and in Europe
o More working capital reduction via portfolio mix optimization
o Selling non-core engineering business (my est.: $100mm EBIT @ 6-7x = > $600-700mm) to accelerate debt repayment and reduce SG&A
§ Engineering business has grown into $100mm EBIT from $10mm just 4 years ago, making it a more attractive selling candidate
o The renegotiation of NA labor contracts will start in July ’06 and the recent events at GM, Delphi and other sunset industries could actually enhance GT's position when dealing with union


Pricing flexibility

· NA
o Volume mix

OEM: 30mm
Private label (replacement): 30mm
Branded (replacement): 40mm
Total 100mm
o OEM: price might not be able to rise if OEM volume declines
o Private label: represented by WalMart – not easy to get price increase
o Branded: also include some value brands like Kelly
o Overall, pricing increase will likely be just enough to offset raw material cost
§ So far, it’s been demonstrated that competitors are having the same cost problems as GT has, and everybody is raising prices
§ However, to what extent pricing increase can continue if raw material cost rises further is an open question.
§ We notice that even WalMart is raising prices on some products.

· Europe
o No private label business
o Predominantly high-performance tire
o As a result, pricing increases are relatively easier in Europe

GT initiated +5-8% pricing increase in NA in September 2005, which was subsequently followed by most competitors - therefore these pricing increases are sticky.


The following earnings sensitivity analysis shows that in '06 and in '07 energy cost will be THE most important driver behind GT's earnings swing.

I. Each 1% rise in oil-related raw material cost (w/o offseting price increase)

Total raw material cost
NA $3.0 bn
Int'l $2.0 bn
Total $5 bn

Oil-dependent raw material (synthetic rubber, carbon black, fabrics & others): 70%
NA $2.1 bn
Int'l $1.4 bn
Total $3.5 bn

Each 1% rise
NA $21 mm
Int'l $14 mm
Total $35 mm

After tax
NA (0% tax rate) 21 mm
Int'l (35% tax rate) 9.1 mm
Total 30.1 mm

Per share
NA $0.10
Int'l $0.04
Total $0.14


II. Each 1% margin improvement from restructuring in NA

’05 Revenue base in NA $9.11 bn
1% margin improvement $91 mm

After tax $91 mm
Per share $0.44



III. Each 1% OEM volume decline (with replacement market flat)

Volume mix
OEM 30%
Replacement 70%
Total 100%

Volume change
OEM -1%
Replacement 0.0%
Combined average -0.3%

Earnings impact

Total NA volume 100 mm
Volume decline 0.3 mm
Avg. price ticket $77.5 mm
Revenue impact $23.25 mm
Incremental margin 37.50%
Incremental profit loss $8.72 mm

Per share $0.04

Implication:
1) Volume is not a significant concern. In a reasonable worst scenario in which NA OEM volume would drop by 10% while NA replacement volume is flat , earnings impact would be only 40c/shr – a manageable number to GT.
2) Further rise in raw material cost, particularly oil price, and GT’s ability to continually raise price to offset such cost increase, will be THE key to an investment in GT. In 2005, raw material cost is expected to rise by 10%. In my current model, I’ve assumed GT to be able to raise price to offset raw material cost, therefore net net no impact on margin. However, if GT is unable to raise price further or raw material price rises far beyond GT’s capability to raise price fast enough to fully offset cost increase, the negative impact on earnings will be significant. Each 3% rise in oil-dependent raw material cost, net of any offsetting price increase, could be approximately equal to 1% margin benefit from GT’s restructuring effort – a big headwind ahead if it really occurs.
3) Nevertheless, with oil already trading above $60/bbl, its impact on consumer economy has started to be felt. As a result, demand response could finally play a counterbalancing role in limiting oil price’s further rise, at least over the next 6 to 12 months. If this turns out to be true, a normal inflation environment could bode well for Goodyear’s pricing increase and margin expansion.


Risk:
1) Drop in NA and global automobile OEM production: OEM represents 30% of total volume, which is not making money (just breakeven) anyway. If OEM demand drops by 5-10%, which could prove to be an exaggerated concern, should have minimal impact on the profitability.
2) Irrational competitive behavior/pricing war: doesn't appear likely given the fact that top three manufacturers (Michellin/Bridgestone/Goodyear) control 55% of global market, and all of them have demonstrated the willingness to protect margin rather than compete for market share.
3) Rising raw material cost: $5BN raw material cost for GT per year, representing 35% of total cost. Key raw materials include synthetic rubber (25% of raw material), natural rubber (20%), carbon black (11%), steel, fabric, etc. However, GT has demonstrated during the last several quarters that they are capable of raising prices fast enough to offset raw material cost increase.
4) Competition from Asian cheaper supply: unlikely be significant given the difficulty of Asian players to penetrate NA dealership system with lack of saftety reporting capability.
5) Pension underfunded by $3.1Bn. Currently all the free cash flow is expected to be spent on contribution to pension funds. The firm is also contemplating a secondary equity offering to further enhance its pension fund but the management indicated that it will only do so at a stock price much higher than the current level.
6) Earnings dilution from a divestiure of engineering business: depending on how GT is going to spend the proceeds ($600-700mm as per my estimate), earnings dilution could be anywhere between 15-25c/shr as compared to the current 2006 st. consensus EPS est. of $1.65 (before adj. for divestiture).

2021-08-17,miser861,MEGACPO.MX,Megacable Holdings,https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/Megacable_Holdings/5450997592,59000000000.0,69.0,"Description
Megacable has been written up here twice. Each of these writeups provides great background and other information, and is highly recommended reading. While subscribers, revenue, and EBITDA have improved every year, the stock price is lower today than at the time of these writeups by Par03 in 2017 and goirish in 2019. As a result the valuation is compellingly cheap now, and already reflects a significant discount for any real or perceived threats facing the company. 
Then and Now
   Main Thesis
The cable and broadband industries have created very significant shareholder wealth in the US and elsewhere, and continue to do so. As demand for high speed internet increases in Mexico, the benefits of Megacable’s newly improved network should become apparent and allow the company to increase earnings as well as cash flows. Capex is peaking out as the company completes its network evolution, and will decline as a percent of revenue in the foreseeable future. Higher cash flows on decreasing capital intensity, combined with higher dividends and potential for M&A, should cause the multiple to move higher and narrow down the valuation gap with US peers. 
Operating Metrics
Even as the stock has treaded water, operating metrics have continued to improve. Homes passed and network kilometers continue to increase. Bundling continues to drive RGU’s per Unique, which reached 2.46 in June 2021. Broadband subscribers increased 13% yoy and 2% sequentially in Q2, and internet penetration at ~40% of homes passed leaves room to grow even as homes passed grow in low single digits.
   Bundling and ARPUs through the cycle
The company’s focus is on triple play and higher, with X-view streaming, HD and Mobile now forming important building blocks of the bundles on offer. One disappointment thus far has been pricing - ARPUs haven't really gained traction in a long time, despite meaningful improvements in these offerings from Megacable. Part of the reason is having to offer compelling bundles to upgrade legacy video subs into the triple play. However, that should change and APRUs should increase once the improved network’s advantage becomes clear in tandem with subscribers’ increasing need for high speed internet.
Video has historically dominated the economic pie for cable companies in Mexico. With cord cutting and streaming, that is set to change. In 2020, for the first time internet subs outnumbered video subs for Megacable. While historically it hasn’t been possible to raise prices on video subs given alternatives that subscribers could churn away to, it would be a mistake to model that same trend far into the future. As the likes of Charter/Spectrum have shown in the US, high speed internet is an entirely different game and price rises will eventually follow.
To obtain a sense of where Megacable is in the cycle, consider that until June 2020 only 35% of subs were receiving speeds of 30 megs or had fiber services. With the rollout of the network evolution discussed below, in June 2021 that number reached 60% and continues to grow. This is laying the groundwork for meaningful speed and price increases in future.
  Some Risks
Risks are mostly already priced in, IMHO. As mentioned in the previous writeups, these risks include regulation, FX exposure, political risk, and the widely known risk of America Movil getting a pay TV license that will enable it to create bundles. While this license may be closer now, most of the Telmex network is still copper with all the disadvantages that come with ADSL. Another competitor worth mentioning is TotalPlay, the cable company owned by billionaire Ricardo Salinas. While TotalPlay has historically not competed in Megacable’s markets, it continues to grow fast and poses an increasing threat. 
GPON and Capex
Looking to the future and in order to address these competitive threats, Megacable has embarked upon a meaningful upgrade of its network. The company is currently spending over 30% of revenue as capex, with most of the money going to convert a significant portion of its network to a Gigabit Passive Optical Network (GPON) that will provide long term benefits.
They have already migrated 500,000 of the 1.3 million planned subs onto GPON, as they roll it out to 12 cities. Hence 40% of the planned GPON project is done, with completion by the end of this year. They intend to take some of the displaced HFC network and redeploy it to other markets. They’re spending $400 million on capex this year, and this is currently putting a dent in free cash flow.
Until last year, Megacable had maintained that capex would come down significantly following the end of the GPON project at the end of 2021. More recently the company has stated that capex will continue at a higher level and they will continue to roll out upgrades to more cities. Capex ran at a high 33.5% of revenue in 2021Q2. The company is now guiding to capex declining to mid 20’s% of revenue by 2024 and low 20% by 2026. This target of ~20% was supposed to be reached earlier, and the delay seems to be part of the reason for the severely depressed stock. The majority of capex will be for GPON. No doubt these network evolution announcements also serve as signalling to competitors eyeing Megacable’s markets. 
FCF inflection coming
With EBITDA margins running in the healthy 50% range, once GPON is complete and capex comes down to low 20% of revenue, free cash flow should improve significantly. As demand for speeds increases, the GPON network which will be capable of 500 Mbps to 1 Gbps should be seen as differentiated and begin to fetch higher ARPUs even as expenses stay relatively flat. Low maintenance capex thereafter should cause FCF to inflect upwards.
This upgraded network should provide a moat worth a higher multiple than the old network. Looking out a couple of years, it is not difficult to see 30+ billion of revenue, 15+ billion of EBITDA and only 6 billion of capex once the GPON upgrade is finally behind them. Approaching 10 billion in EBITDA - Capex, the stock could double from here even in the absence of significant M&A or stock buybacks. Potential M&A could accelerate the upside. There is still a compelling case for combining with Televisa’s cable subs, especially since that company is now separating out and contributing its content assets into the new Televisa-Univision. Liberty Latin America remains another potential M&A candidate, since Mexico should be a valuable addition to their portfolio. 
I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise do not hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.
Catalyst
As stated above, the valuation in terms of EV/LTM EBITDA has come down from 9.7x to 6.3x to the current 5.5x. Unfortunately we don’t have stock buybacks as a big catalyst, but there is still a limit to how cheap Megacable can get. M&A remains a potential catalyst. If M&A does not occur, time will be the catalyst. As capex declines and higher speeds translate to traction in pricing, dividend payouts could increase sharply forcing the stock to be revalued. Meanwhile we already get paid a 3.75% dividend yield to wait, one suspects not for too long.",-17.984700897033733,-14.866787327244758,-26.61757642993843,-9.31119268301088,5.276877269292361,-1.0433750165209095,-3.77534066005479,-7.4238819680365955
2018-01-16,go2bl93,CALX,CALIX INC,https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/CALIX_INC/7213706684,302000000.0,5.95,"Description
I believe Calix, Inc (CALX) represents a compelling long opportunity at current levels. The story here is relatively straight-forward. The stock is currently trading near historic low valuation levels in terms of EV/S due to extremely depressed bottom line results YTD in 2017 caused by several factors that should reverse moving forward, and more recently by a negative pre-announcement from their primary competitor. While the stock does not currently appear cheap on bottom line metrics (they’re generating losses), I believe they will return to profitability in 2H18 and their significant earnings power (relative to the current valuation) will become apparent over the next 12-18 months. Trading at just 0.5x EV/Sales, the valuation is compelling for a company that has grown its top line at a respectable 9% CAGR over the past 5 years (since 2012), was consistently profitable on a full year basis from 2010-2015, and has a target operating model of double digit operating margins. As they return to profitability and show progress towards their target operating model, I would expect the valuation to move closer to its nearest comp (ADTN) at about 1.2x Sales, representing a more than doubling in the stock from here.  
  What do they do?
CALX is a supplier of hardware/software to Communications Service Providers (CSPs). They are focused on the access (or last mile) piece of the telecom network. Their offerings enable CSPs to provision a wide range of service offerings to end customers through packet-based technologies over diverse types of physical networks (DSL, DOCSIS, GPON, etc). Basically CALX products allow their CSP customers to increase offerings to their end customers while reducing investment in physical networks and with lower operating costs. Their customer base is primarily telcos (as opposed to cable) in North America and they’ve historically served Tier 2/3 operators. While they have about 1300 customers, they do have some customer concentration, with CTL being their largest at 21% of sales in 2016 (and likely somewhat more than that YTD in 2017). 
  Historical Results
    As one can see, the recent poor operating results are not at all consistent with their historical profitability levels. 
  Verizon opportunity
Before getting into a discussion of CALX’s recent results and my forecasts, I’ll briefly discuss what is likely the company’s biggest top line growth driver moving forward, namely VZ’s NG-PON2 rollout. By way of background, both ADTN and a CALX/Ericsson partnership were selected in mid-2016 for initial lab trials. ADTN specifically press-released their participation in mid-2016, while CALX did not. However, ADTN has referred to being one of two vendors in the trial, and CALX on their Q217 earnings call talked about beginning field trials for NG-PON2 with a ‘large North American Tier 1’. This can only refer to VZ. CALX on the same call stated “this customer can and we believe will become a greater than 10% customer. There's no question in our minds about that.”
It is believed that VZ will end up using both ADTN and CALX/Ericsson in their NG-PON2 rollout. This article discusses VZ’s goal of using multiple vendors and interoperability amongst vendors:
http://www.lightreading.com/gigabit/fttx/verizon-proves-ng-pon2-interoperability/d/d-id/729487
…while this blog indicates a belief that CALX/Ericsson will be the “primary beneficiary” of VZ’s NG-PON2 (albeit they speculate at poor margins):
https://www.fibereality.com/blog/ericssoncalix-de-facto-ng-pon2-model
The timing of the ramp is certainly still an open question. ADTN stated recently that they don’t see a ramp from VZ before 2H18, though VZ (speaking at CALX’s annual user conference in October ‘17) said the following:
""If everything goes correctly... by the end of the year it should be in a state that's a deployable state from Verizon's perspective,"" said Verizon Director of Technology Vincent O'Byrne, speaking at the 2017 Calix Connexions Innovation and User Conference here. ""[We will then] start deploying probably in the first quarter of next year.""
http://www.lightreading.com/gigabit/fttx/verizon-preps-ng-pon2-rollout-for-q1/d/d-id/737807
In summary, I assume that CALX is involved here and that VZ likely becomes very material to revenues over time. As discussed more below, I assume some upward inflection in growth in 2H18 due to VZ.
  Recent results/model
    While CALX’s recent top line growth has been strong at 14% YTD in 2017 (relative to its 5-year CAGR of 9% since 2012), this has been entirely driven by significant growth in its recently negative GM services business, which has been the primary factor driving bottom line losses recently. Focusing specifically on the services business, a couple factors have been responsible for significantly dragging down GMs here, namely their taking on (or perhaps being forced by large customers to take on) significant structurally low margin ‘development services’ business, poorly priced contracts (with poorly defined project scopes) signed in 2016 that largely have been recognized in 2017, and poor internal management/cost controls. 2017 YTD service GMs are -17% and were -27% in Q317. There are a number of reasons to believe this drag reverses moving forward:
They have guided service GMs to breakeven in Q417 and to reach 30%-40% over the course of 2018.
Historically, they have done 30%+ service GMs as recently as Q415 and 20%+ in 1H16 before the significant ramp in low-margin, poorly priced/scoped projects signed in 2016.
They brought on a new Head of Services in December 2016, who previously held a similar role at both Motorola Solutions and Avaya, under whom new projects signed have had positive GMs according to management due to better defined project scopes and internal cost controls. These are still significantly being masked overall by the bad projects.
They’ve stated that many of these bad projects that have revenue’d this year have year-end deadlines for completion. 
Moving forward they have stated they plan to outsource more of the low-margin development services work to partners, while focusing on higher value-add consulting services engagements.
  The other significant factor driving losses recently has been a big ramp in R&D spending, as they’ve invested significantly in 1) their software-defined networking (SDN) platform called AXOS which they believe will be accretive to product GMs over time, and 2) investment in projects for new customers (I believe significantly related to VZ). Non-GAAP R&D expense increased nearly $10M from $21.7M in Q116 to $32.5M in Q117 (a 50% Y/Y increase), but has trended down slightly since then and has been guided to continue to trend down in $ terms moving forward as the incremental spend for investment in the AXOS platform is largely finished at this point. 
  Finally, I’d note that product revenues will likely grow sub-1% in 2017, substantially lower than in prior years. This also likely has been a drag on sentiment recently. I think this re-accelerates in 2018. While the company did not historically break out product revenue versus service revenue, the disclosures in 2017 included 2016 splits and indicate that product revenues were well over 90% of their business through Q316 (but had fallen to 83% of revenues in Q317 due to the 200%+ growth in services revenues). I think the 5 year revenue CAGR of 9% is generally representative of their product revenue growth rate over that period, given how immaterial services revenue had been before 2017. I believe the biggest reason for this slowdown in 2017 is a tough Y/Y comp (when revenues grew 13% in 2016), while management also attributes it somewhat to a shift in spending by their customers towards services. I find the latter explanation a bit questionable to be honest. Nevertheless, I believe that product revenue growth should move back towards the historical trend for a couple reasons:
Lapping the tougher comps from 2016
Much of their growth in services revenue has been in development services (as noted above) for CAF (Connect America Fund) II projects (https://www.fcc.gov/connect-america-fund-phase-ii-auction ). CAF is a program that provides carriers federal funding for providing broadband service to higher cost rural areas. As the name ‘development’ services would suggest, these service engagements are done early in the deployment cycle and are likely a leading indicator for product sales, as CAF II projects move from the development stage to deployment. Carriers first were awarded funding under CAF II in 2015.
Ramp up of NG-PON2 business with VZ beginning in 2018 
  In the model above, the key assumptions I’ve made for 2018 are:
Product revenue returns to growth in 2018, particularly in 2H18 as they begin to see some meaningful contribution from VZ.
Service revenues decline somewhat as I assume they outsource some development services to partners.
Product GMs stay at 48%, inline with CY16 and Q317, but below CY15 levels and their target model of 50%+ overall GMs. I assume some margin benefit from their AXOS SDN platform, but also assume it is offset by likely lower than corporate average margins with VZ. Net/net my product GMs could be conservative given I model them at a $600M+ annualized revenue run-rate in Q418, the level at which they target overall GMs of 50%+.
Service GMs turn positive, but only reach 25% by YE18 (versus company guidance for returning to 30%-40% service GMs over the course of the year). This is purely conservatism as they obviously have shown awful (much worse than expected) GMs this year, so I choose to be significantly below management here.
Total OpEx approaches their 40% of revenue target model by Q418. Guidance for Q417 actually already implies sub-42% of revenues, so with more revenue scale and the dialing back of R&D, I’m comfortable that they can hit 40% before too long.
Minimal taxes: these are just foreign taxes. They have a $240M deferred tax asset from NOLs as of YE16, so they will not be a domestic taxpayer for a very long time. I’d note that I expect they will mark down the value of this off-balance sheet deferred tax asset due to the lowering of the corporate tax rate, but that doesn’t change the fact that they will not be a cash taxpayer domestically for a very long time.
Under these assumptions, their operating margins approach 5% in Q418 (and annualized EPS approaches $0.50), putting them well on their way towards their target 10%+ operating model ($1+ in EPS) with continued revenue growth.
  Current opportunity
In addition to the factors discussed above that have dinged profitability (and the stock) that I believe will reverse moving forward, most recently competitor ADTN pre-announced a big miss on revenues in Q417. On 12/28/17 after the close, they announced that revenue would come in at $125M versus prior guidance of ~$160M, a miss of over 20%. (on a side note, a nice gift to their institutional shareholders on the last trading day of the year!) 
They blamed merger-integration related spending delays at a ‘domestic tier 1 customer’. This customer is CTL, who acquired LVLT during the quarter. In addition the being CALX’s largest customer, I believe CTL is also ADTN’s largest customer at 24% of 2016 revenues. ADTN’s stock has predictably sold off (~11%) since the announcement. CALX’s stock has also been hit – it’s currently down over 6% since ADTN’s pre-announcement (after selling off as much as 12%). This is despite CALX announcing their earnings date this past week without themselves pre-announcing. My discussions with the sell-side in the immediate aftermath of ADTN’s pre-announcement led me to believe that it was one particular program at CTL where ADTN was the sole supplier that was the culprit. That said, given the magnitude of the miss, I believe ADTN must have seen weakness elsewhere beyond CTL given the magnitude of the miss (unless CTL essentially went to zero for them, which seems unlikely). We’ll know more about ADTN when they report this coming Wednesday, Jan 17. But the fact that CALX did not pre-announce only strengthened my view that this was ADTN-specific. While I can’t rule out that some CTL-related weakness could show up for CALX, the stock has already been marked down, which I believe is likely presenting an opportunity here. 
  Valuation
Given that CALX has recently been unprofitable and I expect it to stay so for a few more quarters, the most tangible valuation metric we currently have to look at is EV/Sales. CALX currently trades at ~0.5x Sales, which is very low relative to:
It’s historical mean EV/S of 0.9x
Its nearest comp ADTN at 1.2x (similar revenue scale as CALX) 
Its target operating model of 10%+ EBIT margins
Its all-time low valuation of ~0.4x
  Insider ownership/buying
CEO Carl Russo has significant equity ownership at 13% of S/O, while officers and directors in aggregate (including Russo) own 16.5% (both as of 2017 proxy statement date in March 2017)
The CFO bought $75k of stock at the end of November at an average price of $6.84 (15% higher than where it is today). Another data point that suggests they likely didn’t see CTL-related weakness developing in the quarter.
  Risks
CTL merger-related weakness
VZ opportunity doesn’t develop as expected or is at awful GMs (and/or OpEx needs to ramp substantially to support a revenue ramp there)
Service margins stay very low/zero/negative
Currently net cash is healthy at $41M, but continued large operating losses could start to eat away at that
I model revenues below consensus in 2018. I believe this is almost certainly due to the street assuming higher service revenues than I do. I don’t view this as all that important as I believe investors will focus more on product revenue growth and my EPS numbers are also well ahead of consensus.
 I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

Plains Resources is (1) a holding company with ownership interests in a pipeline-based master limited partnership (Plains All-American) and a California based exploration and development company (Plains Exploration: PXP); (2) deeply undervalued; (3) run by management that has made money for investors in the past, and have made substantial, personal investments in the stock; and (4) in the middle of engineering a catalyst that should lead to value recognition. Imminent time pressure compresses this submission, feel free please to follow up with questions.

(1) Asset Base: PLX owns 4 main assets. (A) 12.4mm LP units in Plains All-American, ticker is PAA. PAA owns a mix of mostly regulated pipeline assets, pays dividends at an annual rate of 2.12 off of the mostly regulated cash flows its pipelines and marketing operations earn, and trades publicly for 22.75 per share. (B) 44% of the GP interest in PAA. The GP has tiered, incentive based claims on the cash flows of PAA. As those cash flows grow, the GP gets an increasing share of them. (C) 100% of Plains Exploration, which has 239mm BOE of proven reserves, mostly onshore, mostly in California. Plains runs a low risk e&p operation (58% success rate on wells drilled over past 5 years), it hedges 75% of its production 12 months forward, takes oil out of the ground at less than $11.00 per barrel (last 5 years data, versus comparable company production costs of $2.00 higher or more), and earns its spread. The company is pursuing a couple of longer dated, home run potential development projects, but these are not material to the current investment case. Consider them upside. (D) PLX owns 25mm BOE of proven oil reserves in FL. I value these at a low price of $1.00 per barrel, or $1.00 per share.

(2) Valuation: (A) Let's value the LP units at the market price. I could write about MLP valuations at length, and this topic has gotten some solid recent press attention in the WSJ. I am not a bull on the MLPs, but these assets do trade, and can be hedged out, so to speak (although the dividend is a clear issue). If you buy the public valuation, the units PLX owns are worth $282mm. (B) The GP is going to get get 5-5.5mm in free cash flow in 02, up from 3.5mm in 01. 10x FCF suggests 50-55mm valuation. There is potential for free cash flow growth exists, as PAA has recently completed equity and debt offerings that should enable acquisitions by the MLP of comparable, regulated pipeline assets. The other 56% of the GP was sold to an investor group (which includes PLX management--this is unfortunate, but my concerns are greatly soothed by the far more significant investments management has made in PLX stock, more below) in early 01 at an implied valuation of the 44% that PLX owns of 32mm. Call a fair price for the 44% GP interest conservatively 30mm (no growth since 01 despite the cash flow growth, 10x FCF multiple). (C) PXP will produce 100mm EBITDA in 02, 110mm in 03. 5.5-6.0x is at the lower end of comparable company valuations. You need to look at oily, California focused companies like Nuevo Energy & Berry Petroleum. These companies operate at higher costs, with more exploration risk, and more commodity price sensitivity. Reference also needs to be made to the 3.25-3.50 per proven barrel that NEV & BRY trade at. 3.25-3.50 per barrel implies 775mm valuation for PXP. There are counter arguments, most of which speak to the longer reserve life of PXP's reserves, compared to NEV's & BRY's. That PXP's projects are low risk, and that its operators are good, mitigates this concern. Putting a per barrel valuation of lower than 2.75 on the reserves is just too low. 2.75 implies 650mm, or 5.9xx EBITDA. PLX has 280mm in net debt, and 25.5mm shares. It's market cap is 525mm. (A)+(B)+(C)+(D) is 987mm, less 280mm in debt, is 707mm, or $27.70 per share. This inherent value estimate is more than 25% higher than the share price, assumes the barrels in the ground at PXP are worth 18% less than their best comparables, and values the GP interest conservatively.

(C) PLX is run by Jim Flores, who founded Flores & Ruxton, and sold it to Ocean Energy for a bundle in the late 90s. Jim bought 1mm shares at $25 on joining the company in 2001. PLX's COO is John Raymond, who also has made a substantial personal investment in the stock. These guys eat their own cooking. And Jim has an established track record as a money maker.

(D) Why is PLX down 15-20% in the past 2 weeks? It tried to accomplish an IPO on PXP in mid-October at an enterprise value of 660mm, could not get it done, and pulled the deal. The issues surrounding the failed underwriting were the market, the size of the deal (280mm debt, 380mm market cap, 70mm offering), and the fact that management did not want to sell stock at an IPO discount. Rather, they are spinning PXP to PLX shareholders, 100%, in the next 3 months. The catalyst is the spin. After some time for the price to settle, I cannot believe PXP is valued as low on a reserve basis as the current price implies. The current EV is 840mm, take out 280mm for the LPs, 30mm for the GP, 25mm for the FL assets (which lie outside PXP) are you get 511mm, or $2.13 per proven barrel, for oil that they take out for 11.00 cash, and sell for 17.00-18.00, assuming the commodity declines in price substantially. After the spin, PLX will be a leveraged play on the MLP, will be unleveraged, have substantial free cash flow, and be an active buyer of its stock.

Attention VIC shoppers: BCE Emergis (IFM - TSX) is on sale now. $3.10 gets you about $2.50 in net cash and securities, plus a business worth another $3 to $5. This is a turnaround situation in which a new management team & board have done a very good job thus far righting the ship. The new Chairman just bought $9.5M worth of stock, and numerous other insiders have loaded up as well. Plus, two reputable value investors with a history of activism have just bought a combined 23.4% of the shares. One of them – Crescendo Partners – has taken a seat on the board. Emergis recently paid a $1.45 special dividend and I would not be surprised if they paid another within a year. I would also not be surprised if this company eventually got sold.

All figures in Canadian $.

BCE Emergis supplies eBusiness solutions to the North American financial services and Canadian health care industries. Bell Canada Enterprises (BCE) invested in them as part of its bubble-era diworsification program back in 1998. But in a story that is all too familiar, diversification did not work out well for this incumbent telco and a chastened BCE is now divesting non-core assets. Their 64% stake in Emergis was sold via underwriting syndicate in June at a dividend-adjusted $3.95 per share, and the sale apparently spooked the market and accounts for the first leg down you see on the price chart (the second leg simply reflects the dividend).

These fears are overdone. First off, I highly doubt BCE sold because they know something we don’t. They’d have to disclose it in the offering docs, first of all. Also, big, lumbering low-growth businesses like BCE are rarely good buyers or sellers of assets. They sold their yellow pages business a few years back for a song to a group led by KKR which converted it to an income trust and flipped shortly thereafter for a huge profit. BCE is under pressure to refocus and Emergis is a rounding-error that has required much more attention than makes sense for anyone running a 19B revenue business.

Secondly, Emergis should do just fine without BCE. BCE hasn’t put any new money into them in years, and frankly they don’t need money because they’re FCF positive and have about $240M in the bank. The BCE name has probably been helpful in closing big deals in the past, but this company has basically left the nest already and has plenty of blue-chip customers/partners who are happy with them. And get this – 84% of revenues are recurring, so they don’t have to win a ton of new business to show growth. Two projects (w/ Freddie Mac and Visa) could start to generate meaningful revenues toward late 04/2005.

But it’s not just the BCE thing that has been weighing on the stock. Divestitures and a major contract expiry have lowered revenues and obscured the progress they’ve made in improving margins at the remaining units, leading some to believe that the remaining Emergis is a collection of dying businesses. That’s just not true – this company is growing, margins are improving, and it’s just starting to throw off cash – but you’ve got to peel back the onion a bit to realize it.

Finally, some of the selling pressure could be simply due to the fact that this recently dropped below $5, meaning some folks can’t own it anymore. To borrow a phrase from Zeke375, some of this might be the standard ‘$5 to $3’ swoon.

Emergis has two businesses: eHealth and eFinance. eHealth addresses the Canadian health market by enabling web-based processing of claims for insurance companies and workers’ compensation boards and provides related security services. Its network reaches 99% of all pharmacies and 65% of all dentist offices in Canada. Revenues were 56.2M in 03 and should be 72.1M in 04. 98% of these are recurring. Since Emergis overhauled its management team about a year and a half ago, they’ve brought EBITDA margins from negative territory in 02 to 18% as of last quarter. So, it’s a nice business to be in.

eFinance is a bit more troubled, but the problems are being fixed. It’s a collection of e-business that automate finance-related processes, some of which are growing, some of which are not. This includes eInvoicing, point-of-sale transaction processing, business-to-business e-payments, web-based tax filing for businesses, etc. Revenues appear to have bottomed and should show a little growth in the second half. EBITDA margins just turned positive. As I mentioned, two major projects with Freddie Mac and Visa should start to gain traction in the next few quarters. Hard to say what the upside is on those but they’re definitely a plus.

Emergis recently made some tiny acquisitions to bolster its eFinance offerings, and they appear to be working out. They make more, which I expect to also be small. They’ll probably also sell some of the non-growing units, so in terms of cash usage I think of it as a wash. I think any cash spent on acquisitions will likely have a quick payback due to the investors I mentioned above.

The contract I referred to is dubbed the Bell Canada Legacy contract – a large, profitable piece of business with BCE that just went away. I won’t dwell on it because it’s no longer a factor. I haven’t included it in any of the figures you’ll see in this writeup.

So what you’re left with is a company with run-rate sales and EBITDA margins of about 200M and 10%, respectively. I think they’ll achieve a 15% EBITDA margin simply by finishing the restructuring program. No Herculean feats required. For what it’s worth, Eric Rosenfeld (the head honcho over at Crescendo) was on ROB TV (the Canadian CNBC) shortly after taking his position and expressed a similar view on margins.

Backing out the net cash of 240M and about 16M of securities (options related to another public company which they got as part of a past acquisition), I get an EV of about 63M. With 15% margins, EBITDA will be over 30M. So, EV/EBITDA is a paltry 2X. EV/sales is 0.4. Meanwhile, publicly traded comps average around 13X EV/EBITDA and 2.3X EV/sales. Private market transactions seem to be in the neighborhood of 2-3X sales.
Even if you penalized them for the turnaround nature of this story, you could still drive a truck through that spread.

Let’s say you put a 10X EV/EBITDA multiple on Emergis. Relative values aside, would that make sense on an absolute basis? Yes – EBITDA is growing rapidly due to top line growth in eHealth and due to the fact that margins are at an inflection point at eFinance (and going in the right direction). Importantly, a big % of EBITDA turns into FCF because capex is far below D&A and because this company has tax assets that will shield almost all of its pretax income for a long, long time. Specifically, they’ll be able to shield over 250M of pretax income.

A 10X multiple on EBITDA of 30M gets you $300M for the core business, or close to $3/share with 103M shares out. Alternatively, a 2.3X EV/sales multiple on 200M sale plus a smidgen of growth gets you close to $5/share. Add that to the $2.50 of net cash and securities and you’re looking at a $5.50 to $7.00 stock price.

Regarding those two investors, Crescendo bought 13.4% of the shares at an average cost of about $3.40 after backing out the dividend. Though they’re based in NYC, Crescendo has a history of taking an active role in Canadian companies and seems to surface value most of the time. They were the catalyst at another Canadian public company - Spar Aerospace - which was sold to L-3 Communications in 2001, for a gain of around 150% in 2 years. With their foot in the door at Emergis, I wouldn't be surprised to see another significant dividend, or perhaps a buyback if prices stay at this level. A good chunk of cash is tied up due to reps & warranties related to a recent divestiture, but this requirement goes away around Feb ’05.

The other large investor (10%) is Letko, Brosseau & Associates. I confess to not be familiar with them, but my Canadian buddies tell me they are a “very good value manager” based out of Montreal. Here’s one heartwarming tale:

“I met them when I owned Ford Canada, they were the driving force behind pushing for a higher value for the take out of the minority shares. They both came from CN pension. They are very good thinkers, and have great integrity. I bailed from the stock prior to the litigation, they held and fought the case through to completion.”

To sum up, given the investors, insider ownership, and management track record, it’s safe to say this company is batting on your team. I think you’re looking at a potential double or better, with downside limited by the huge net cash position. I’ll take those odds all day long.

I’m not affiliated with anyone mentioned in this report.

While I’m not adamant about it, I would recommend that U.S. investors not hedge the currency if they buy this. I am wary of the U.S. Dollar for all the reasons that WEB cites, and I view the Canadian Dollar as a “less bad” currency. As they say, if you choose not to decide, you’ve still made a choice, and I’d rather not choose the Buck over the Loonie at the moment.

Intro
Photocure is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the bladder cancer market. Its main commercial product, Hexvix (called Cysview in the US), improves the diagnosis of the disease by causing tumor cells to glow under blue light. The current standard of care uses white light and can miss 25-35% of cancer tumors. The company is commercial stage with its product approved and sold globally. Geographic expansion represents a material growth opportunity for the company. Its products are used in 5% of cystoscopies in the US versus 65%+ in Norway and Denmark. In 2018, the drug received favorable a reimbursement ruling which should set the stage for accelerating growth over the next few years. 2020 was impacted by COVID but the company still managed to grow unit sales in the US. I expect growth to accelerate considerably next year. The management team is targeting revenue in the range of NOK 1 billion and EBITDA margins at 40% in 2023 vs a current EV of 2,820 NOK. If the company comes close to those targets the stock should at least be a double with potential for upside beyond that.
  Bladder Cancer Market
Bladder cancer ranks as the sixth most common cancer worldwide with 1,650,000 prevalent cases (5-year prevalence rate), 550,000 new cases and almost 200,000 deaths annually in 2018. Bladder cancer has the highest lifetime treatment costs per patient of all cancers. Patients have to undergo multiple cystoscopies due to the high risk of recurrence. There is a need to improve both the diagnosis and the management of bladder cancer for the benefit of patients and healthcare systems alike. 
Bladder cancer is classified into two types, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), depending on the depth of invasion in the bladder wall. NMIBC are the most common (75%) of all bladder cancer cases. In MIBC the cancer has grown into deeper layers of the bladder wall and is more likely to spread and harder to treat. It is important to catch the disease before it has progressed to MIBC.
  Hexvix
Photocure’s drug Hexvix improves the diagnostic process by causing cancer cells to glow under blue light. Traditionally, bladder cancer diagnosis was conducted through white light cystoscopy where a urologist uses a cystoscope with a lens and a white light to identify suspicious lesions. Once lesions are identified, the urologists can surgically remove cancerous tissues, through a procedure called a transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT). However, there is a risk of missing tumors, (estimated to be as many as 25-35%) especially the flat and aggressive carcinoma in situ (CIS) lesions. The blue light cystoscopy (BLC) technology allows one to easily detect tumors that would otherwise be ignored under the white light cystoscopy. These overlooked CIS lesions are often the culprit for progressing non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) to muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). The below image shows the same bladder and lesions with white light and blue light with Hexvix. 
  A 2018 study of blue light cystoscopy in surveillance of intermediate and high risk NMIBC showed that 20.6% of malignancies were identified only by blue light cystoscopy. An additional study demonstrated that recurrence rates for patients that were evaluated with BLC were considerably lower than white light.

  Growth Runway
The product has been around since 2004 which naturally begs the question of “why now?”. In early 2018 the company received a positive reimbursement change which has been an important factor in accelerating the business in the US. The company’s current CEO also joined in 2018 and has taken a number of steps to improve the growth profile of the business. He has professionalized the sales organization and emphasized a consultative approach with doctors to drive blue light adoption. Although Hexvix is a pharmaceutical, it is sold very much like a medical device given its use is dependent on the availability of a blue light cystoscope. As the below graphic demonstrates blue light tower installations have grown significantly in the last three years setting the stage for Hexvix volume growth in the coming years. COVID impacted 2020 but the total number of BLC towers placed will still be higher than any year prior to 2018. 
  The US remains very under-penetrated should provide a long growth runway. Prior to the pandemic, the company was growing 30-40% in the US. I think the company can accelerate this growth over the next few years given the step up in BLC placements and improved sales focus. 
  Europe
Last spring the company announced that it had bought back the distribution rights for Hexvix in Europe from Ipsen. Partner revenue from Ipsen over the past few years has been stagnant and the number of BLCs placed in Europe has not grown in a decade. I think Photocure taking control of the sales activity in Europe represents a material opportunity to reaccelerate growth. Relative to its total revenue base, Hexvix was immaterial to Ipsen and likely did not receive the type of focus needed to realize its growth potential. By implementing a similar consultative sales approach that has been effective in the US, I think Photocure can begin to close the penetration gap in Europe vs its home territories in the Nordics.
  Valuation
Given the rapid growth profile, valuation is much more art than science. Shares currently trade at 16x consensus 2022 EV/EBITDA. On management’s 2023 targets, shares trade at 7x EBITDA. I think this is too cheap given the growth runway.

High Level View
CIR is a downside protected call option on the European Long-term Care (“LTC”) sector (as CIR has a 371mm euro net cash balance compared to 513mm euro market cap) . Despite 2020 being a horrific year for the LTC industry, I expect most of the Coronavirus-related headwinds to reverse in 2021+ due to the aging European population and critical nature of LTC. I value CIR’s stake in KOS (its LTC business) at ~400mm euros based on a 5% 2022 FCF yield discounted to today. Additionally, CIR is trading at a ~45% discount to NAV (highest in 6 years) despite management taking a notably more shareholder friendly approaching over the last year. I see ~40% upside to CIR based on 20% discount to the sum of 1) its stake in KOS, 2) the value of CIR’s other smaller business investments (18% of NAV) and 3) its net cash position (net of holding company costs). 
  Company Overview
CIR is a holding company that currently owns a 1) ~60% stake in KOS, a long-term care facility operator, and 2) a ~57% stake in Sogefi, an auto OEM. As you can see below, CIR's LTC asset and net cash make up ~80% of NAV.
KOS
Historically, KOS has been an Italian LTC operator (~97% of revenues) with 8,510 beds currently. 
Italian market is highly fragmented and regulated. KOS has been able to grow bed count by 400-500 beds per year with stable EBITDAR margins. 
KOS owns ~25% of its real estate 
On October 30, 2019, KOS entered the German LTC market via an acquisition Charleston Holding from EQT for 92mm euros. Charleston has 47 residential facilities/4,050 beds in Germany
In 2018, Charleston generated 152mm euros of revenue (estimated 30.4mm euros EBITDAR, estimated purchase multiple of ~13x 2018 EBITDAR)
…as you can see below KOS revenue/bed and EBITDAR margins have been expanding over time
Other assets
KOS owns a hodgepodge of other (lower quality) assets. For example, Sogefi supplies filtration systems, air management and engine cooling systems and suspension components to the automotive sector. It’s a low margin (<5% EBIT) business that is highly cyclical. 
CIR also owned a large stake in a publishing company (Gedi). However, CIR sold most of its stake in Gedi to Exor for ~90mm euros (6.5x fwd EBITDA). A 60% premium to the pre-merger share price. 
Net Cash – CIR is trading at a very modest premium to its net cash position today (lowest level in 6 years)
  Italian LTC Market has been Highly Attractive
Italian market has incredibly high barriers to entry for private operators. As Korian (a large European LTC operator) notes below, regulatory authorization for new beds is very hard to come by in Italy. KOS is the largest publically traded operator in Italy and grows bed count ~4.5% per year.
KOS is also focused on Northern Italy where demand for LTC per 65+ resident is highest.
  Strong Italian LTC fundamentals are also reflected in KOS's financials, which reflect consistently rising revenue/bed, EBITDAR margin and ROE.
  …with next 10 years set to be better for Italy LTC than prior 10
Italy’s population is aging faster than almost anywhere else in Europe with bed penetration well below that of peer countries. Therefore, as Korian notes below, waitlists for beds in Northern Italy are long and the Italian government is actively saying it is increasing its share of spend on LTC. 
  German Market (which CIR/Korian just entered) is also attractive with lots of high IRR rollup opportunities
All of Europe is set to see dependency ratios rise in coming years and the German market has lots of small, private operators
  Korian provided a breakout of its acquired facility EBITDAR margin vs core EBITDAR margin in 2010. You can see private operators in Germany run at ~half the EBITDAR margin of larger players. This is mostly attributed to 1) complex German reimbursement system, 2) frequent government care inspections and 3) tight labor markets.  


I estimate that unlevered IRRs on nursing home rollups exceeds 20%.
  Coronavirus likely to cut EBITDAR in half for LTC in 2020…but I expect most of this to reverse in 2021+
Occupancy (30% EBITDAR reduction in 2020)- likely down ~2-3% per month based on commentary from US operators (CSU, Welltower, Healthpeak). This makes sense given the 30 month average stay of a LTC occupant (so you lose 3.33% of your occupants every month assuming no new check ins). If you expect this quarantine lasts from March thru June, you come out to around an 8% decline in occupancy assuming we hold occupancy at June levels). Notably, the European operators have been a bit more bullish. Orpea (reported 3/17/2020) actually reaffirmed their 8% YoY 2020 revenue growth guidance.  
I broadly expect a near complete reversal of this occupancy loss…Nursing homes are not hotels or casinos. They provide an essential service (Orpea grew volumes organically during the GFC) and occupancy in Europe was already incredibly high going into the Coronavirus.


Costs (20% EBITDAR reduction in 2020)- There are two buckets of cost inflation. 1) PPE, which Healthpeak says is 2% of LTC facility costs, has tripled in price and 2) Labor, which is 50% of a nursing home costs, has gone up 5-15% in the US according to Healthpeak. 
I expect PPE inflation to completely reverse given commoditized nature of the product. 
Labor cost inflation could be stickier (maybe nursing homes are less attractive to work at than in the past). However, I expect the European market to be less impacted than the US market given 1) labor markets in the US are a lot tigher than in places like Italy and 2) KOS average staff cost is ~35k/year (compared to US nursing assistant average salary of $19k)
Notably, Korian/Orpea have both noted limited employee absenteeism and have soft guided to only a 1-2% increase in labor pay. 
I use Korian’s income statement to illustrate impact of Corona (tho Orpea has near identical cost structure…KOS doesn’t provide granular cost buckets). I only expect ~11% reduction in EBITDAR from staff costs to potentially be sticky into 2021+ as discussed above


KOS Valuation 
KOS FCF in 2019 was 45mm euros. Note: they acquired Charleston (Germany LTC business) at end of October 2019 (in 2018, that business did 152mm euros of revenue/~30mm euros of EBITDAR).
I model 1) a reversal in occupancy declines from 2020 over 2021/2022, 2) a reversal in PPE cost inflation by mid 2021 and 3) German margin improvement from 20% EBITDAR margins to 25% EBITDAR margins by 2024 (in line with Korian/Orpea). 
I don’t think my numbers are particularly aggressive. I still have 2022E FCF at $38mm euros (WITH Charleston), which is below their Italy-only FCF in 2019.
  I value KOS at end of 2021 at a 5% Fwd FCF yield and then discount back to today. This values CIR’s stake in KOS at ~400mm euros


Company appears to be doing more for its shareholders and simplifying its corp structure
  In February 2020, CIR merged into Cofide with the new company named CIR S.p.A. – Compagnie Industriali Riunite
This obviously simplified their corp structure and dramatically improved the float of the business (went from trading 60k euros/day to 600k euros/day)
In April 2020, CIR sold its 45.8% publishing business stake to EXOR for euro 102.4mm
Further simplifies the company and gives them ~92mm euros of cash (post 5% reinvestment) 
Sold secularly declining business at a 60% premium to its trading price prior to acquisition (sold at 6.5x Fwd EBITDA…when US advertising centered companies like PUB and MDP trade at 5x fwd EBITDA)
Rodolfo De Benedetti took over as Chairman of CIR in April 2013. He and his two brothers are controlling stakeholders of CIR
While Rodolfo has said he will not use the excess cash for dividends (said before CIR shares sold off on Corona), he is likely to reinvest in KOS (high returns business)
  While SOTP stories are always seductive, this one seems interesting given most of the value comes from either KOS (secularly attractive business) or net cash (which is likely to get reinvested into KOS). I see 40% upside to the stock given my value of KOS, public market values for other notable investments and a 20% conglomerate discount. 
Note: to get hurt on this investment, you really need to believe either 1) KOS is a zero (which I strongly do not believe) or 2) the company will do something reckless with their cash…which is possible but seems unlikely given the shareholder friendly actions taken to date

I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise do not hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

  I. Summary
Brunswick Corporation (“BC”, “Brunswick”, or the “Company”) is a leading global designer and manufacturer of recreation products including marine engines, boats, and fitness equipment.
At $52, BC is offering investors compelling absolute value with the stock trading at 12x 2018 EPS and compounding earnings at a mid-double-digit CAGR through 2020.  
From here, there is >50% upside in the stock as investors can get paid on earnings growth in the core business driven by new product launches, accretive deployment of significant balance sheet capacity, a re-rating of the stock as investors figure out that parts & accessories story, a separation of the business to realize the sum of the parts, and/or a change in the management team that has seen multiple years of de-rating and stock underperformance.
Thesis detail:
      i.         The parts and accessories (P&A) business within Marine Engine is misunderstood and undervalued;
     ii.         Investors are getting the Fitness business for free on a reasonable sum-of-the-parts; upside from a cardio equipment refresh that is written off for dead by Mr. Market; optionality from a spin or divestiture
   iii.         New outboard engine launch will drive upside to consensus 2018 estimates of at least ~$0.20
    iv.         Balance sheet optionality and optionality on a change in management as stock has derated significantly and not performed

      II. Company Overview
a. Corporate History
Brunswick was founded by John Moses Brunswick as a manufacturer of billiard tables in Cincinnati in 1845. The company soon expanded into making a number of other products, including bowling equipment (balls, pins, etc.), and other diverse products such as toilet seats, automobile tires, and phonographs. While the Bowling and Gaming businesses are largely gone from Brunswick’s current corporate profile, the Company introduced innovations to the world through products such as the magic eight ball and air hockey, both of which were invented by Brunswick.
In 1960, the Company entered the marine industry through the acquisitions of two boat manufacturers, Owen Yachts (sold in 1970) and Larson Boat Works (sold in 1964). Brunswick subsequently acquired Keikhaefer Corporation, the predecessor of Mercury Marine (rebranded in 1971). In 1974, Mercury Marine introduced their outboard engine in Australia, and in the U.S. and Europe in 1974. In the 1980s, through several acquisitions, Brunswick became a major maker of yachts and pleasure boats, whose brands include Bayliner (1986), Boston Whaler (1996), Maxum (1988, organic), Sea Ray (1986), and Trophy (1988, organic). In 1993, Brunswick acquired Swivl-Eze, a fishing seat pedestal manufacturer, marking its first entry into the parts & accessories segment. In 2001, Brunswick increased its exposure to large luxury boats with its acquisition of Hatteras Yachts, as well as Sealine, and Princecraft. In 2004, Mercury introduced the Verado engine, a technologically advanced four stroke outboard engine, the only supercharged outboard in its class.
In 1997, Brunswick acquired Life Fitness, a manufacturer of strength and cardio fitness equipment, marking its first foray into the fitness. Later in 1997, Brunswick acquired Hammer Strength, adding to its offering of strength training to the professional segment of the market (health clubs, colleges, pro sports, etc.) .
Share Price History
  b. Business Summary
Brunswick operates in two segments: Marine and Recreation. Within Marine, sales are broken down by Marine Engine (core engine / parts & accessories), and Boats. Recreation is entirely comprised of the Fitness business (Brunswick sold its retail bowling business in 2014 – the company still manufacturers lines of billiards, air hockey, and other gaming tables under the Fitness segment).

The Boat Group also includes a commercial and governmental sales unit that sells products to commercial customers, as well as to the United States government and state, local and foreign governments. The Boat Group procures most of its outboard engines, gasoline sterndrive engines and gasoline inboard engines from Brunswick's Marine Engine segment.
The Boat Group sells its products through a global network of approximately 3,000 dealer and distributor locations, which may carry more than one of Brunswick's boat brands. Sales to the Boat Group's largest dealer, MarineMax, Inc., which has multiple locations and carries a number of the Boat Group's product lines, represented ~24% of Boat Group sales in 2016.

  Fitness
Brunswick’s Fitness segment is comprised of the Fitness division (Fitness), which designs, manufactures and markets a full line of cardiovascular fitness equipment (including treadmills, total body cross-trainers, stair climbers and stationary exercise bicycles) and strength-training equipment under the Life Fitness, Hammer Strength, Cybex, Indoor Cycling Group and SCIFIT brands. The Fitness segment also includes Brunswick’s active recreation business, including billiards tables, accessories and game room furniture.
Fitness' commercial customers include health clubs, corporations, schools and universities, hotels, professional and collegiate sports teams, retirement and assisted living facilities and the military and governmental agencies. Planet Fitness Inc. is the segment's most significant customer (estimated at anywhere from 10-20% of the segment’s sales). Fitness makes commercial sales through its direct sales force, domestic dealers and international distributors.

Previously, he served as Vice President and Treasurer of Brunswick from 2001 to 2013 and in a number of positions of increasing responsibility since his employment with Brunswick began in 1987.
d. Marine Market Overview
Below are the six most important charts that summarize the state of the marine market in 2017. They are summarized as follows:
      i.         New boat sales remain well below prior peaks
     ii.         Outboard boats (and engines) are taking share from sterndrive and inboard – this trend will continue
   iii.         Outboard engine attach rate (engines per boat) have been steadily climbing from 1.1 to 1.6, as a) boats are sold with more engines on them, and b) boats are “repowered” with new engines
    iv.         Boating participation and interest among adults remains healthy
     v.         Dealer inventory is healthy
    vi.         New boat sales are not keeping pace with obsolescence – a bullish indicator for future new boat demand
(i) New / Used Boat Sales
  New and used sales are 43/7% off prior peaks
 
  (ii) Marine Engine Market Share by Type
  Outboard engines have continued to take share from sterndrive / inboard
 
  (iii) Outboard Engine Sales per Outboard Boat Sold (attachment)
  Outboard engine attachment rates have increased from 1.1 to 1.6 per outboard boat
 
  (iv) Boating Participation Among Adults (mm, %)
  Boating participation remains healthy
 
  (v) Supply Chain
(vi) Obsolescence
      Channel is healthy
       
  Obsolescence should support new sales
        The Setup
As discussed in Marine Market Overview, the marine business is healthy – we have had five years of M/HSD unit growth and MDD average retail sales growth. In 2017, we have seen softness in the large boat category (65’+). No one in the industry has a good answer as to what is driving the large boat softness – the most common response is that “dysfunction in Washington is causing small/medium business owners to hold off on discretionary spending”. Whether this is true or not is irrelevant given a) Brunswick’s exposure to engines is more affected by unit sales than dollar sales, and b) large boats are historically not an indicator of the health of the boating cycle. However, given the large ticket of yachts, MarineMax (HZO-USAA, the largest boat dealer in the U.S.), printed an ugly Q3 (July) and missed their comp badly. While units were up HSD (arguably a more important read-through for BC), mix weighed by double digits. This caused a panic selloff in Brunswick’s stock (see chart below, 7/20/2017). Brunswick’s boat segment was not immune from this softness and they saw a weak print in Q2 from the loss of these large ticket boats. In response to this large boat softness, Brunswick decided to furlough some capacity and to clean up the channel (allow inventories to normalize). We could see some further softness in Q3 on a wholesale level, but a) this is now much better understood, and b) retail sales have already picked back up. One last thing worth pointing out is the fact that the sample size in question is extremely small – for context, total U.S. Yacht sales in 3Q17 were 176 – so the “-10%” we saw in August, for example, was a decline of six boats. Again, the impact to sales is meaningful (these boats can cost anywhere from $1-500mm), but on a unit basis, it is almost irrelevant.
Additionally, in Q3 BC reported a $0.10 EPS miss and cut 2018 EPS guidance by 10% on continued large boat softness and increased competitiveness in the Fitness business in Europe. The Fitness performance was a disappointment, but as discussed further in the Thesis section below, this kind of lumpiness in Fitness sales is common especially ahead of a large equipment refresh, which is occurring late 2017/early 2018. The large selloff in the stock post Q3 was a result of poor communication by management as well as a mismatch of investor expectations in terms of when the sales of new equipment would start showing up. This has created a very attractive entry point for investors that understand the real earnings power of this business.

      III. Investment Thesis
a. Misunderstood value in parts & accessories
Brunswick is seen as a boat manufacturer; the profitability of the business actually comes primarily from engines, and more specifically parts and accessories – the defensiveness and recurring revenue of the engine and parts business makes the company much higher quality than the stock is given credit for.
It is important to illustrate how misunderstood this stock is – many investors think of Brunswick as a boat company, but boats are actually only 12% of the Company’s profitability. Management has never quantified the profit margins of the parts and accessories business, but have indicated they are meaningfully above the corporate average. Conversations with formers and industry contacts reveal that P&A is at minimum 10% higher margin than core engines – assuming a 15% premium implies P&A margins are ~23% and engines are ~8%. These assumptions drive the profitability breakdown below:
Revenue Breakdown (2016)
Est. of Profitability Breakdown (2016)
      While the engine business is obviously levered to the health of the boating cycle (although it is secularly growing, as discussed in Marine Market Overview), P&A is actually quite defensive. The P&A business is roughly broken down into 80% aftermarket and 20% OEM. Brunswick’s CFO notes that P&A OEM sales will cycle with engine sales, but the aftermarket piece is very steady – in the 2008 financial crisis, aftermarket sales contracted by less than 5%.
The table below is another way to think about how the P&A business is being undervalued. Assuming 8x EBITDA on the boat and core engine businesses, 12x on the fitness business and 10x on corporate expenses (see comps in Exhibit 4), the current stock price is implying the P&A business is trading for ~4.5x. Given the high quality nature of this business, this is unjustifiably low. It can be debated what multiple this business should trade at, but every turn drives $4.30 per share of value (or ~8% upside):
P&A Implied Multiple
 
    Growing the P&A business is BC’s top priority for capital deployment – since 2014, BC has acquired 150mm+ worth of P&A sales, and has a stated goal to acquire 350mm through 2018. As of 3Q17, BC’s balance sheet was essentially untapped (~50mm net debt). Assuming the Company has a leverage limit of 2x EBITDA, it has ~1.2bn of dry powder. Further assuming a 10x multiple paid for P&A businesses, BC can acquire at least 120mm of EBITDA. Not only will these acquisitions be accretive, they will serve to further diversify the business into a more defensive segment which should drive the multiple higher.
b. Misunderstood fitness business; you are getting this piece for free
Under a similar framework, using reasonable valuation assumptions on the non-Fitness segments, investors are buying the Fitness business for less than nothing. As per comps (see Exhibit 4), a reasonable multiple for this business is more like 12x – not -4.5x. 
Fitness Implied Multiple
  See table above as this did not transfer/format corrrectly
    As discussed in The Setup, the fitness business has essentially been written off for dead. From conversations with industry contacts, including the former head of the Fitness segment, as well as analysis of the historical performance of this segment, it is immediately obvious that this kind of volatility is par for the course in fitness equipment. Management noted competition in Europe that drove some pricing softness – everyone seems to be forgetting that this is a very common pattern – this kind of promotional intensity comes and goes all the time. In fact, now that Technogym is a public company (the manufacturer that is reportedly causing the disruption), this has been happening with less regulatory than it once did. While it is not pleasant to see pricing pressure in a particular geography, there is no reason to think there is a structural change occurring.
Fitness Organic Growth
 
    There is no rationale as to why the Fitness business belongs under the same parent company as the Marine business. Management acknowledges there are no synergies, procurement or otherwise, and the businesses operate as completely standalone entities.
There are subtle reasons to believe that we may be closer to monetizing this business than many think. When Dusty McCoy was CEO, management were generally staunch defenders of the Fitness business – they would argue that it provided diversification away from the cyclical marine business and that it was a core part of the Brunswick portfolio.
“You're going to see that we're talking about fitness still and we will; it's our core business.”
  – Brunswick Corporation, Analyst Day 2015
Today, management is upfront about the fact that they are not getting appropriate credit for Fitness (or P&A for that matter) and that all options were on the table in terms of realizing that value. In addition, BC hired a new President of Fitness in January 2017 – Jaime Irick – who was the former Chief Commercial Officer of GE Lighting, a ~$3.5bn business with 17k employees. Jaime replaced Chris Clawson, who was a lifer from Life Fitness. Feedback on Chris was that he was doing a great job growing this business – while it cannot be proven, Jaime’s hire could have been part of the new BC CEO’s strategy of preparing this business to operate as a standalone company.
Cardio Refresh
Brunswick is launching a complete refresh of its cardio equipment in 2018, with a focus on connectedness and integration with the cloud, smart devices, etc. PLNT has been proactively bringing up the launch in investor meetings and indicating their anticipation of a meaningful improvement to the quality of their clubs.
In 2016, cardio sales represented ~55% of Fitness topline. Cardio equipment has higher margins by “at least double digits” as compared to strength equipment. It is important to note that the majority of Fitness profitability is housed within cardio equipment – highlighting how impactful sales growth in this segment is.
Fitness Revenue Breakdown (2016)
Est. of Fitness Profitability Breakdown (2016)
      The table below is self-explanatory – the last two cardio refreshed in 2004/2005 and 2010/2011 saw three year margin expansions of 400/900bps, respectively, and three year topline growth of 22/28%, respectively. While management is not forthcoming with details around the launch, management highlights that the 2010-2012 timeframe was a reasonable proxy to think about for the launch in 2018.

·       2012: Life Fitness introduces Synrgy360, a system that combines several weight training machines into one, geared toward the personal training market


    While the Q3 softness in Fitness looked scary on the surface, it is important to note that the softness was driven a) by European competitiveness, which as discussed has waxed and waned over time, and b) was on old equipment, not new. The new equipment began shipping late in Q3 and several products are still being released. Conversations with the former head of the Fitness segment indicate that this is a common occurrence – clubs will often delay purchasing until the full refreshed product suite has been made available. It is worth noting the soft organic growth in 2004 before the 2005/2006 refreshes (we see some softness in 2009/2010 but it is hard to disentangle from broad economic weakness).
Planet Fitness Vitality Upside
While the cardio refresh discussed above should drive upside to margins and topline over the next 2-3 years, there is another dynamic at play that is not fully appreciated by the market. As discussed, PLNT represents anywhere from 10-18% of Fitness segment sales. In 2015, Planet Fitness began enforcing strict vitality rules – clubs that operated with equipment that was of a certain age were mandated to order refreshes (from Life Fitness). Cardio equipment is mandated to be refreshed every 4-5 years, strength every 6-7 years. The chart below illustrates the tailwind from aging PLNT stores – from 2012 through 2015, PLNT locations essentially doubled. These stores will be forced to refresh their cardio equipment in 2017-2020, providing a nice tailwind for Fitness revenue. Assuming a 40% incremental on these sales, and using street estimates for net new PLNT stores, this drives an incremental 6% and 4% EBIT growth in 2018/2019. This analysis also conservatively assumes PLNT is 10% of Fitness sales – if the number is closer to 20%, those growth numbers will double.

    c. Misunderstood value in engine business; 2018 product launch and share opportunities
Mercury is launching a new class of engines for the 2018 season. While management has been reluctant to release any details to the public, management’s excitement is very self-evident:
“But it's no secret, we're investing significantly in a product program. And we get -- Bill and I get really excited about our opportunity there. But no, I can't really talk about it yet…   We want to talk about it, but we can't talk about it.”
– 3Q17 BC Earnings Call
Looking at the years with engine launches there is a clear correlation b/w an engine refresh and Marine Engine margin expansion. Management has indicated that this launch should be no different than year’s past – in other words, a 100bps lift to Marine Engine margins is a conservative assumption. A 100bps increase in margin will drive upside of $0.20-0.25 of eps vs. consensus estimates.
Engine Margin Expansion [platform refresh years in red]
 
    Channel checks have revealed speculation that Mercury may be planning to launch 200/250HP four-stroke outboards – while Mercury currently manufactures 200-250HP outboards, they only make a two-stroke model. Two-stroke engines have been steadily losing share to four-stroke: (see chart above - formatting doesn't work)
Market share by two vs. four-stroke and different horsepower are difficult to discern – however, a reasonable guess is the 200-250HP four-stroke product is ~5-10% of the outboard engine market (currently dominated by Yamaha), and if Mercury’s average market share in outboard is 30-35%, this could be a market share opportunity of 150-350bps. Orders for 2018 boats should start hitting BC’s books in the fall – in theory, management should have a reasonable line of sight on orders and be able to present some degree of confidence at the Miami Boat Show in February.
d. Underperformance Since Management Change
It is notable that BC has had significant multiple compression since 2015 – BC has gone from ~18x forward P/E in 2015 down to ~12x today. Over the same time period, BC has grown EPS by ~50%. From the post-recovery period through late-2015, the stock traded consistently above 16x. Since then, the stock has traded pretty much under 14x, which coincidentally or not, coincided with the appointment of the new CEO Mark Schwabero, who took the reins in early 2016.
Some investors argue that the compression in multiple is a result of the aging marine cycle, but that is simply not the case when you look at the valuation of marine-related peers – multiples have actually expanded by 8% over the same time period (see below).
Of course, the compression in BC valuation cannot be solely attributed to the new CEO, but the sentiment is consistently negative and growing more so on the management team – a change at the top would be very well received. 
P/E Compression vs. Peers (indexed 08/2015)
  IV. Risks
a. Consumer Cyclical
Boats are a cyclical good and a recession would have a direct impact on Brunswick’s sales and profitability. While the P&A business does provide some protection, as discussed earlier, the majority of Brunswick’s sales and operating profit are driven by highly discretionary consumer product. During the Great Recession, the Marine Engine, Boat, and Fitness business saw sales declines of -40%, -75%, and -25%, respectively.
For context, the P&A business was virtually non-existent during the 2001 recession – a year in which Brunswick’s total sales declined by 12%. If the aftermarket component of P&A is 20% of today’s sales, and would have declined 3% in the 2001 recession (sales declined MSD in 2008), that would mean the sales decline on the business with today’s mix would have been 10%. In other words, the P&A segment today makes Brunswick ~20% less cyclical. This is arguably understated given the relatively modest decline in 2001.
Like most big ticket consumer discretionary products, the majority of boat sales are made on credit. If credit should cease to be available, or rates rise meaningfully, we could see a decrease in demand for boats and engines.
b. Yamaha Product Launch
Yamaha has not done a real outboard refresh in several years – engine refreshes are a significant driver of engine sales. Channel checks reveal Yamaha plans to launch a 400HP F series to compete directly with Mercury’s 400HP Verado – currently Yamaha only has a 350HP offering. While Mercury engines have been taking share from Yamaha in saltwater markets, Yamaha’s refresh could in theory slow that trend. However, channel checks also reveal a generally more positive view towards Mercury products in general given quietness, reliability and lower replacement/maintenance costs.
It should also be noted that fulfillment is a concern for Yamaha product; multiple sources have confirmed that there is a delivery backlog through January on the Yamaha 350s, and that other products are unavailable for order given supply chain issues.
c. Planet Fitness Contract
Brunswick is the exclusive supplier of fitness equipment to Planet Fitness, which represents somewhere from 10-18% of the segments sales (management says 10%, others in the industry indicate it could be higher). This exclusive contract is coming up for renewal in 2018 – the loss of this contract, or the loss of exclusivity, could have a material impact on Brunswick’s Fitness sales. On PLNT’s latest conference call, they indicated they have RFPs out with the three main equipment OEMs: Life Fitness (BC), Technogym, and Matrix.
From conversations with industry contacts and channel checks, it appears the risk of BC actually losing the contract is fairly low. PLNT has been forthcoming with their excitement in several public forums throughout the year. While there could arise the situation where PLNT is able to negotiate more favorable terms to PLNT given a formal bidding process is underway (which is how PLNT 3Q17 commentary should be interpreted), this should be more than offset by the launches discussed earlier in this write-up.
In a worst case scenario, even if the entire PLNT contract is lost, that would only be a ~3.5% hit to consensus EBITDA in 2018.

Description
Belden is a cabling and connectivity company that serves two primary end markets: Enterprise and Industrial.  Within the Enterprise market the company provides cabling and connectors for non-residential construction and residential construction / service installation, as well as media production equipment for live sports and news production.  Within the Industrial market the company provides similar cabling and connectivity products as the enterprise segment, as well  as some networking and software products, primarily for discrete manufacturing automation.  The Enterprise segment is roughly $1.5b in revenues and the Industrial segment is roughly $1b in revenues.  The company’s largest distributor is Anixter (12% of revenues in 2018), and the company’s main Enterprise customers are MSOs like Comcast, and main Industrial customers are automated discrete manufacturing solution providers like Rockwell and Siemens.  The company is headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri.
  Executive Summary
The short thesis on Belden is that while the company pitches itself as a high quality connectivity company powered by strong secular trends, it is in fact mainly a copper-based cabling and connectivity company with no growth / secular headwinds.  Additionally, I think there is an underappreciation for a) the poor quality of earnings, and b) how the company has had to steadily add leverage in order to grow the company at just a LSD-MSD inorganic rate over the past several years.  While Belden would like to be compared to companies like Commscope and Amphenol, I believe that the differences in growth rates and margins results in a significantly lower deserved multiple.
   Business Quality
In their marketing materials, Belden pitches themselves as being exposed to positive secular trends like Industrial Automation, Smart Buildings, Bandwidth, and Video Consumption, and suggests these trends have been the forces behind their >6% revenue CAGR and increase in reported EBITDA margins.  I believe this is a disingenuous representation of the company.  I believe the strongest headwinds for the company are in the Enterprise segment.  In that segment the company breaks down their “key markets” to the attractive-sounding segments of “Smart Buildings”, “Final Mile Broadband” and “Live Media Production”.  The reality is that the company is primarily providing copper-based cabling and connectivity equipment to these markets which is in secular decline.  For example, when you talk to them the company admits that their “Smart Buildings” growth has under-indexed non-resi construction spend because copper-based products that connect phones and desktops to jacks in the walls are in secular decline.  There is a similar discussion to be had regarding the “Final Mile Broadband” segment where the company will admit that the fact that fewer set-top boxers are being installed in homes, as a result of cord-cutting, is a headwind.  Lastly, in the “Live Media Production” market customers are being pressured by cord-cutting and OTT services, in the context of a competitive environment full of private sub-scale players; the company is exploring the sale of this business but given that competitive landscape, this sounds challenging.
  Re: copper exposure, while the company suggests in public that it has substantially diversified away from copper through acquisitions and divestitures, one can look at the 10-K’s over the last decade to see that the level of copper purchase obligations has been a slow and steady bleed and is still substantial; i.e. much of this business is copper-based cabling and connectivity products that are in secular decline.  The result is that the organic growth rate of Belden has substantially lagged that of both it’s largest distributor Anixter, as well as its peers like Amphenol, Commscope, TE Connectivity, etc.  In the table below you can see that in a strong economic environment over the past three years, while the peer group has averaged 5% YoY organic growth each Q, BDC’s average rate is barely above zero and lags the competitive set in >80% of the last 12 Qs.  I think that a quote from the recent 10-K sums up BDC’s growth rate perfectly: “Since 2014, we have grown revenues by 12%, from $2.3b to $2.6b in 2018, representing a 2.3% compounded annual growth rate for that period.  The majority of our revenue growth has been the result of our inorganic initiatives”.  Basically, the company has no organic growth, has grown more recently at rates less than half of peer organic growth, despite that all being generated by substantial spend on M&A.

  Furthermore, that margin performance is with the benefit of consistent restructuring charges at the company being excluded.  As you can see in the table below, the margin gap grows wider when including the restructuring charges in EBITDA, and more importantly the restructuring charges are fairly consistent in terms of timing and size, vs sporadic M&A, suggesting they should be considered ongoing operating costs rather than one-off expenses.

  One exercise that I think is useful to do to put BDC’s growth, margins and M&A in perspective, is to look at leverage over the last decade while the company has grown at a total (including M&A) compounded rate in the low to mid-single digits.  Including recurring restructuring charges and the company’s 2016 issuance of convertible preferred stock (realize this is mandatory conversion to equity this summer, but I include it in net debt in this exercise to see the “cost” to the company’s balance sheet of funding pretty mediocre growth), net leverage has gone from around 1x to 3.5x.  Going forward I believe the outlook for this business is that they have less capacity to do deals, those deals will continue to be expensive (they want to do small fiber deals, but admit the price tags are high), and that this business will become more clearly viewed as a mediocre, levered business facing secular headwinds.
  Valuation
I look at BDC on their 2018 recurring/cash EBITDA – i.e. reported EBITDA with restructuring charges subtracted.  I think that on growth disappointments the stock can trade at 7-8x that number, representing ~20-35% downside back towards the 52wk low.

The One Group Hospitality (STKS) reminds us of Jason Industries which we wrote up earlier.  Both were spacs, where management did not perform, investors and sell-side analysts bailed and the stock plummeted, driving the company deeper into microcap land.  Then new management came in and made significant changes but it took a while for the investment community to notice/care.  Investors are starting to notice STKS.  The stock is now up 44% YTD and there are several recent 13D filers (including another one today).  This is an illiquid stock that is moving quickly so we’d suggest anyone genuinely interested in the name contact the CEO (Manny) who is very responsive to investors. 
STKS operates upscale, high energy steakhouses that “cool” people such as VIC members frequent.  STKS has approximately 34 venues which include 29 restaurants and 5 hospitality services (for hotels/casinos).  The units are located in premier locations such as  NYC, South Beach, Orlando, Chicago, Atlanta, Denver, LA , Vegas, San Diego, Toronto, Londo, Ibiiza, Dubai, Mexico City and Milan.  We believe there are significant opportunities to grow the footprint (without much capex) since there are plenty of cities throughout the world that might be interested in having an STK restaurant since relative to other traditional steakhouses, STK is more female friendly and has a more social vibe with music, etc. 
Last October the Board appointed Manny Hilario, a Board Director, to CEO, replacing Jonathan Segal who became Executive Chairman.  Manny is a true operator (as opposed to his predecessor who was more into the “scene” and less into the numbers).  Manny had most recently been CFO of Sizzling Platter, a restaurant platform focused on adding and scaling segment leading brands.   Before joining Sizzling Platter, Mr. Hilario served as COO for Einstein Noah. He previously had served as CFO for Einstein Noah Restaurant Group, Inc., McCormick & Schmick’s Seafood Restaurants, Inc., and Angelo and Maxie’s.
The company is in the process of transforming into an asset-light company with the goal of owning fewer restaurants and managing/licensing more restaurants.  Manny has also done a very good job of improving the performance of the existing units, reducing corporate overhead and preparing the company for growth.

      STKS’s growth will come in four forms:
1)       Opening 3-5 new restaurants per year (mostly non-company owned) to capitalize on an expected short term 150 unit market opportunity.  The economics of opening a new unit are very attractive and are laid out in the investor presentation.
2)       Increasing hospitality business as hotels and casinos are increasingly looking to exit that business and have another party take responsibility for it.  STKS is targeting 1-2 new agreements per year.
3)       Operational improvements – Increasing SSS (volume and pricing), increasing store efficiency, buying better (now that the company is de-levered) it can get better terms from vendors.
4)       Other – The company has a HQ in an expensive NYC market and may ultimately move to a cheaper location.  In addition, the company will likely refinance some of its expensive debt ($6mm at 10%).
  The company expects Adjusted EBITDA of $10 – 10.5  million this year (growing significantly next year) derived from

    Based on our conversations with management, we conservatively believe free cash flow for 2019 should approximate:
Adj Ebitda                              $13 million
Interest                                    (1)

Taxes                           (1)
Free Cash Flow           9
  For an equity market cap of only $85 million dollars , this seems cheap on an ebitda or free cash flow basis.  (note there are some warrants/options not included in my calculations that I can’t calculate as I sit on this delayed airplane)
This ebitda/free cash flow number may be quite conservative since it doesn’t include much benefit from a debt refi or from some potential cost savings.  EBITDA will increase in 2019 from improving restaurant operations, the full year contribution of units opened in 2018 and new unit openings in 2019.

2010-11-26,Siren81,LNG,CHENIERE ENERGY INC,https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/CHENIERE_ENERGY_INC/3356625538,345000000.0,6.2,"Description
  Cheniere Energy, Inc., common stock is a likely terminal short with identified catalysts and multiple ways to win. A borrow is available in reasonable size at rates of about 4-5%.
By the company's own estimates, cash burn is $50mm/yr, total liquidity is $80mm and there is over $750mm of secured debt due in the next two years. Cheniere's stock has more than doubled in the last month on the hope that the company can build a plant to export liquefied natural gas (LNG). However, even if Cheniere can somehow restructure the $750mm of debt and obtain the required permits, contracts and over $3b of financing required to build export capacity, there is still little value left for common stock holders.
Company description
Cheniere Energy, Inc., owns 41% of the common interests and 100% of GP and subordinated equity of Cheniere Energy Partners, as well as the Creole Trail gas pipeline. Cheniere Energy Partners is a publicly traded (AMEX: CQP) MLP that owns the Sabine Pass LNG facility. Sabine Pass is the largest LNG receiving terminal in the US, with regasification (import) capacity of 4.0 Bcf/d and LNG storage capacity of 16.9 Bcf. Creole Trail is a 94-mile gas pipeline that connects to Sabine Pass and is effectively dormant. At current gas prices it is not economical for the US to import LNG, so CQP's only income is derived from capacity contracts with Chevron and Total, which require payment regardless of usage. These contracts provide for ≈$250mm of revenue per year.
Liquefaction
When Sabine Pass was conceived several years ago, most people assumed that the US would always need to import natural gas in order to meet the country's energy needs. Fast forward to today and this is clearly not the case. Rather, the US has an excess supply of gas, making LNG imports uneconomical. In response to this problem, Cheniere has proposed building a facility to turn natural gas produced in the US into LNG (a process called liquefaction) for export to Europe and Asia, where gas prices are higher and are linked to oil costs. Liquefaction is a complex process that requires purifying natural gas and cooling it to -161 °C. As such, permitting and construction of these facilities takes about 5yrs and costs several billion dollars.
Cash flow from a possible liquefaction project would accrue to the Cheniere Energy Partner's subordinated equity and thus create value for Cheniere Energy, Inc. The market is clearly excited about the liquefaction project, as evidenced by the recent stock price movement. However, a closer look at the numbers shows that the value of this project is not nearly as great as market prices imply. As shown in figure 1 below, even using rather aggressive assumptions the unlevered liquefaction project barley generates a positive NPV at a 10% cost of capital.

              Of course this all assumes that Cheniere can actually complete this project. Thus far, Cheniere does not have FERC approval, does not have contracts with customers and has not given any indication how they plan to raise $3 + billion.  A recent Citigroup report stated: ""ENN seems skeptical about if an agreement can be reached. The concern is that the PRC Government, which has planned over 10 LNG terminals... might be reluctant to approve other import sources.""  I think its important to remember just how far in the future this project truly is and that signing a MOU is much different than a true contract.
Capital Structure / Cash Flow
Cheniere's capital structure is complex. I would refer you to page 30 of the company' recent investor presentation (link below) for an illustration.
http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9NDAxMzg1fENoaWxkSUQ9NDA4Nzk4fFR5cGU9MQ==&t=1
As shown on page 28 of this presentation, Cheniere Energy, Inc., burns $45-$55mm per year. As of September, there is about $82mm of cash at the parent. The company's 12% convertible PIK notes are putable in August 2011 when the face value will be about $275mm. These notes are secured by Cheniere's CQP common stock. Even if Cheniere can redeem the PIK notes with remaining liquidity and a sale of the CQP shares, the company would be left with no cash flow or liquidity to deal with the $502mm of debt due in 2012. Thus creditors will likely end up owning the remaining assets, leaving nothing for equity.
As a side note: On Thursday, Moody's downgraded the Sabine Pass (""OpCo"") bonds to B2 and placed the credit on review. A central reason given for this downgrade was the high risk of default at Cheniere Energy, Inc. when the PIK notes become putable.
Even in a ""best case""... this stock is overvalued
So let's assume everything goes right for Cheniere; operationally, the liquefaction project is built on time, at a cost on the low end of estimates, and the company signs contracts at the high end of projections. On the financing side, the company retires the PIK notes with the CQP shares and remaining cash and raises $500mm of equity (85mm shares) to retire remaining debt on terms that are not punitive to current equity holders. In this highly unlikely case, the value of the liquefaction project would be split among 141mm shares, creating a fair value of ≈$4/share. This scenario is detailed in figure 2 below.

    Management
Cheniere is effectively controlled by Chairman/Founder/CEO Charif Souki. Mr. Souki is a former investment banker (perhaps not surprising after looking at the capital structure) described by many in the industry as a better salesmen and financial engineer than businessman. Certainly, much of Cheniere's communication surrounding the liquefaction project is aggressive and potentially misleading (although not to the point of being dishonest). Given that the liquefaction retrofit is the only source of equity value for Cheniere Energy, Inc., and the company needs to raise equity to survive, it is not surprising that management would aggressively ""sell"" this project.
Other risks
Cheniere has 2Bcf/d of unused import capacity. Given the industry utilization rate of <10% and the historically wide spread between US and European gas prices (currently about $4/mmBTU), it is reasonable to assume this capacity is worthless for the foreseeable future. That said, gas markets are highly volatile and the risk of this capacity becoming valuable is >0%. However, any ""tail risk"" here can be cheaply hedged using US/UK gas swap futures, or deep out-of-the-money calls on gas prices, or by the owning of other stocks that would benefit from higher US gas prices.

This stock price is highly volatile. It is highly possible that Cheniere could announce more progress toward the liquefaction expansion which sends the shares temporarily higher.
  Appendix A- What will the Liquefaction Plan Cost?
I believe the capital cost of Cheniere's liquefaction facility is about $3-$4B (≈$400-$500/ton), based on conversations with experts in the industry and comparable projects. A number of government and private reports cite capex requirements of about $600-$700/ton.1,3 The projection for InterOil's Papua New Guinea plant of a similar size to Cheniere's is $6B.4 Cheniere's retrofit could cost less, however, as certain storage and marine infrastructure is already in place. However, these costs represent less than 25% of total project costs and Cheniere's project will have much higher labor costs than those of comparable plants in developing economies.2
In company presentations, Cheniere shows ""comparable"" projects in the $200-$300/ton range. However, such comparisons are not appropriate, as these projects were started nearly 10yrs ago5 when capital costs were about half what they are now.1 Costs today are largely unchanged from 20082.
The Freeport, TX terminal undertaking a similar (if slightly larger) retrofit to Cheniere. In a press release announcing the project the Freeport cited ""over $2 billion of direct investment"".  Some have interpreted this to mean that the total project will cost $2b. However, I believe there is some confusion between total capex and ""direct investment"" which refers to only a portion of total costs.

A reasonable range of costs for these projects in a year 2000 construction environment might have been $250 to $300 and with the 2007 costs utilized in this study $450 to $575. (After completion of this report for the Energy Commission, Jensen Associates updated their cost estimates as part of their ongoing consulting work.

Thought this was timely so apologize if organization of the writeup is less than optimal.
  Investment Framing
If debt issuance makes you cash flow positive, then Pop4Pres is opening up a bunch of credit card accounts, maxing them out, and then IPO’ing himself.  Who wants to invest? 
  Kidding aside, RUN called itself “structurally cash flow positive” in 2017.  Cash and restricted cash increased $43m YoY “adjusted for one-time items including accelerated inventory purchasing (approximately $20 million) and $8.8 million related to a prior business acquisition” (so really $14m) AND its debt increased by $389m.  Therefore, excluding debt issuance, cash burn was ~$375m.  That is not “structurally cash flow positive”; in fact, that is exactly the opposite and 100% dependent on capital markets.
  Business Description
What RUN is not: an innovative solar company with some sort of proprietary energy technology 
What RUN is: a combination roofing company, marketing organization, and financial engineer entirely dependent on debt 
  Financials
Back to basics - what are returns on capital?
Numerator
Pre-tax lease gross margin as the numerator (i.e., ignoring all corporate costs)
Very generous definition of ROIC
Company has plenty of NOLs so in fairness wouldn’t be a taxpayer for a while
Denominator
80% of B/S in on B/S systems as mentioned aboveImplies most of the B/S is for the lease business 
90% of MW deployed are leased x remaining 10% of assets
90% of MW deployed are leased so those stay on the balance sheet as “Solar Energy Systems, Net” which itself is 80% of assets
View lease margin over the entire balance sheet
Treat panel sales separately
No matter how you measure returns, they’re low
Reviewed a handful of capital-intense lease/rental businesses and almost none have gross margins that high (e.g., autos, railcars, equipment rental companies, etc.)
Typically 25%-40% 
RUN business is arguably lower maintenance once the panels are installed so if all the stars align maybe they get above 40%
Sub-2% on an actual basis
~5% assuming lease business gets to 60% gross margin from 20% today
    Blended cost of debt is 4.5%, although cash interest over average debt was higher (~4.9%) last quarter and income statement interest is higher (although looks like this is largely accounting conventions)
If the business triples lease margin and has zero opex it barely earns its cost of capital at the gross margin level
  “Cash Flow Positive” Claim
Company made the claim of being “structurally cash flow positive” last year
Does not provide bridges from GAAP numbers
The footnote is easy enough to understand
But investors don’t know all the adjustments that would have to be made and hence would have to just take management’s word for the claim rather than deciding for themselves what really is “cash flow.”
Almost feels as if the company knows the SEC wouldn’t be happy about the claims
Does not disclose this “cash flow” number in press releases or even a consistent non-GAAP table
Nonchalantly displays it on a slide like the above
And calls out that the company is “cash flow positive” at the top of the first page of its quarterly earnings release without providing the number
Re-arranging the cash flow statement is helpful
Clearly the company is not “structurally cash flow positive”
The company burned $100m in cash from operations in the last twelve months and $394m in FCF
MW deployed was down YoY, but cash burn was up YoY in Q1
Panel costs are only part of the equation and are not falling much anymore
Management will probably say that it’s gearing up for Q2
The bigger piece is labor, racking, etc. (i.e., laying the roof)
Bull case says look at PPA math, ignore today; but if RUN grows deployments, it burns more cash.  Apparently if it shrinks deployments, it burns more cash too...
The business had more cumulative MW deployed than it did last year (i.e., more leases generating revenue), but should have had lower install costs / equipment capex for the period due to the lower deployments
“Payments for the Cost of Solar Energy Systems, Leased and to be Leased” was +2% YoY even though MW deployed was -7% YoY
Semantics
The bull rationale for including this line in operating cash flow is that RUN is monetizing a valuable asset, the tax equity credit by getting proceeds to fund installs
That is the also the problem though. The bulk of these cash flows only occur when RUN spends a ridiculous amount of capex to install new systems and gets the funding up front...therefore, the inflows don’t continue if installs stop.  So if installs cease then capex disappears, contributions received disappear and reported operating cash flow would still be massively negative in that situation - what gives?
Only a small portion is related to payments received by RUN from the leases, because the tax equity holders get an outsized portion in the early years.  My guess is less than 5% of this line is recurring income to RUN
These outflows are actually more ongoing in nature because they are covering expenses / are shares of income attributable to JV partners rather than up front financing
Distributions paid are $57m LTM vs. contributions received of $575m, so including both categories (as I have) flatters RUN’s metrics
Bulls would probably argue that what I’ve labelled “non-controlling structures” is operational cash flow; but I wouldn’t.  Included in this line is 1) “Contributions received from noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests”, 2) “Distributions paid to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests” and 3) “Acquisition of Non Controlling Interest.”  I don’t show each individually in the cash flow above, but provide some context below on the first two, which are the largest - you can see the disaggregated amounts in the cash flow statement
“Contributions received” - “The owner partnership uses the cash contributions received from the tenant partnership to purchase systems from us and/or fund installation of such systems.” 10-K
“Distributions paid” - “Customer payments made to the tenant partnership are used to pay expenses (including fees to us), make master lease rent payments and pay preferred return distributions to the fund investor.” 10-K
  General Thoughts on Economics / Other
Economics
6% discount seems aggressive
Long-dated, subordinated cash flows in a debt-laden structure
Very rate sensitive analysis - going to an 8% discount rate can reduce NPV/watt by >60%, 10% would make NPVs negative without making any other adjustments
90% renewals at year 20 for an additional 10 years on rates that grow at 2.5% inflation seems...optimistic
Solar cannibalizes itself at ~15% penetration
Driving power prices down may undermine the economics of the PPAs - are customers really going to pay 2.5% more / year for years on end if the supply of solar generation is increasing and feeding more power back into the grid?
Is this a case of losing the forest for the trees - i.e., you can model out all the PPA math, but do supply/demand and market dynamics support the mechanical inputs?  What happens if customers think PPA rates are unfavorable? Etc.?
Doesn’t look like creation costs are coming down much
Most of this cost is sales and marketing and installation
Unlikely to get much more leverage here in my opinion
Will competition force RUN’s hand into more panel sales than leases?
Likely better for the consumer, can pay in installments and benefit from not being locked into escalating power agreement
Not a good business - basically like selling TVs
We could debate PPAs all day, but a few thoughts:
Germany Example
Has moved aggressively towards renewables, yet German CO2 emissions per person have been flat to up as renewables’ share increases.  Have to keep dirty coal plants running because they are most cost effective to turn on/off to deal with intermittency of renewables
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2017/10/10/why-arent-renewables-decreasing-germanys-carbon-emissions/#aeadf8b68e15
California Example
http://environmentalprogress.org/big-news/2018/2/12/electricity-prices-rose-three-times-more-in-california-than-in-rest-of-us-in-2017
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-09/think-solar-is-upending-california-s-power-grid-now-just-wait
Is seen as an energy leader, but benefits disproportionately accrue to the wealthy and power costs go up for everyone else
Glut of power also causes issues on the grid, which is another concern for governments
New rule will potentially exacerbate home price issues
  Why Now?
News flows have been a positive tailwind and shares are up 100% in the last year
California solar mandate
Florida will allow leasing
Bullish sellside sentiment
Q1 2018
The bull case is don’t pay attention to today’s cash flows, do your PPA math, and you get positive NPV
However, Q1 = fewer deployments and higher burn - does that make sense?
Another part of the bull case on RUN is that it will take share as others pull back from leasing
Maybe owners are seeing more value in buying and the market goes in that direction instead
Solarcity, which is owned by TSLA, which has no problem burning cash, says that the lease model is too much of a burden…
http://buffalonews.com/2017/04/28/solarcity-move-away-leases-loans/
Management previously gave investors the heads up on a soft Q1 due to a pull forward in demand related to changes in AZ policy, caution around tax policy and tariffs, etc. - the deployments being down wasn’t a surprise
However, the company stopped disclosing MW booked and MW deployed saying that the two were converging.  Maybe, or maybe they don’t want investors looking at the order book if it gets weaker?
MW deployed were down YoY but FCF was worse as discussed above
Leased MW deployed was down more than total
With interest rates rising, funding costs are likely to go up, and the company’s returns at the gross margin level are below the cost of debt before any rate increase
  Miscellaneous
Executive/Board Turnover (might not be anything but two President/COO figures in two years, a GC this past month, and a member of audit committee)
Mina Kim, General Counsel and Secretary - resigned Apr 2018
Jameson McJunkin, Board Member on audit committee - resigned Mar 2017
Paul Winnowski, President and Chief Operating Officer - retired Dec 2017, no new job?
Tom Holland, President - retired Dec 2015, only with company two years, went on sabbatical after leaving (aka left without a job lined up)
Teamwork makes the dream work!
Former CS analyst covering RUN was hired to head IR.  New CS team initiated with extremely bullish report a couple of months ago
  Valuation
I think that RUN will go bankrupt at some point
Some really quick and dirty math for triangulation
Invested Capital = ~$3b x 0.5x MOIC (earns well below cost of capital at gross margin level...) = $1.5b
Panel business = $320m in LTM sales x 5% assumed EBIT margin for retail/distribution business x 8x multiple = $130m
Net debt = $1.2b
Minorities (i.e. financing vehicles) = $490m
  Upside Risks / Bull Case
High short interest
Counter: uh huh...
Price can remain irrational
Counter: at some point fundamentals still matter, size appropriately
Will take leasing share as SCTY reduces leasing
Counter: let them, when ROIC
Solar panel costs will fall
80% of the industry is imports.  5 suppliers = $185m in RUN purchases vs. COGS of $239m last year  
For 2016 contracted minimum of 120MW and up to 150MW from REC, which manufactures in Singapore Link
A Chinese co bought REC Solar in ""a move that may help circumvent trade disputes in the U.S. and Europe."" Link
Up to 135MW from Hanwha Q Cells, which is based in Korea and manufacturers in Malaysia and Korea Link
Canadian Solar supply of 112MW in 2016 Link
Counter: panel costs have already fallen and the efficiency and price is not changing that rapidly anymore.  If panels were such a large component then tariffs would be a killer (see suppliers below). Reality is most of the cost is manual labor of delivery and install and sales/marketing
I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

2021-03-31,Thor25,DSP,VIANT TECHNOLOGY INC -REDH,https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/VIANT_TECHNOLOGY_INC_-REDH/5341824750,2870000000.0,50.4,"Description
Without a doubt, the programmatic advertising technology (""AdTech"") sector has been on fire in the public markets lately, and for some very good reasons: COVID-19 accelerated the secular shift to digital advertising as marketers funelled ad dollars to the best performing return-on-ad-spend (ROAAS) channels, eCommerce sales surged and stimulus payments buyoed consumers, and after a terrible March - May for the space, budgets quickly recovered and in many cases surpassed initial 2020 targets. 2021 appears to be set up as a recovery year with some very easy ""comps"" in Q1 and Q2 and continued secular tailwinds, particularly in areas of surging spend like connected TV (""CTV""). The confluence of these bullish factors has seen tier-1 AdTech assets like Pinterest, Snap, Trade Desk and Magnite (formerly Rubicon) trade up by between 2-4x from pre-pandemic levels. 
Unsurprisingly, bankers have not wasted this moment to bring lower tier AdTech assets to market, most notably with the IPO of supply side platform (""SSP"") Pubmatic (PUBM) in December and now the IPO of demand side platform (""DSP"") Viant (DSP) this February. Whereas the aforementioned tier-1 companies have durable moats related either to user base / 1P data (PINS, SNAP), or product and technology leadership (MGNI, TTD), we believe neither PUBM nor DSP have particularly strong technology and believe each company's extremely low level of R&D spend at ~2.5m per quarter to be reflective of such (for comparison, MGNI spends ~15m and TTD spends ~50m quarterly on R&D). Yet, while PUBM is at least outgrowing the industry (materially, its Q1 guide that is quite conservative was still set for ~40% yoy growth) on the back of what we believe to be a strong set of short-term tailwinds and robust execution, DSP is not (with a Q1 guide of 11-14% growth ""ex-TAC"" and 0-1% inclusive of TAC or traffic acquisition costs).
DSP's disclosures are also anemic compared to peers and its valuation is exorbitant and highly unjustified at nearly 20x ex-TAC revenues and 100x EBITDA, versus PUBM (who we believe has sandbagged to a much greater degree) at 13x / 45x and MGNI which we have trading at 15x / 50x for a much higher quality asset than Viant. Furthermore, DSP's ""story"" (we know that every 20x sales IPO needs one and has one), is highly dubious when compared against that of other AdTech players:
PINS has access to a coveted demographic of in-market shoppers that are essentially building shopping lists, so costs per thousand impressions (""CPM"") should be structurally high. 
SNAP has similar access and dominates mindshare along with TikTok and IG in an extremely difficult to access demographic, and has made substantial investments in its programmatic AdTech stack that appear to be paying off. Both SNAP and PINS obviously have robust 1P data sets.
After merging with CTV platforms Telaria and SpotX, Magnite is positioned to be the go-to source of programmatic CTV ad inventory for marketers, and is also run by one of the best CEOs in the industry in Michael Barrett. MGNI is also investing extensively in audience / ID capabilities to cope with cookie-less by leveraging the datasets of its publisher partners.
Trade Desk has THE best CEO in the industry in Jeff Green, and is the go-to DSP of choice for all ad agencies and brands looking to transact programmatically. TTD has also built out robust identification capabilities that will prove useful in a cookie-less world and is evangelizing its universal ID, which has gained widespread acceptance by SSPs. 
PUBM has a capable management team, is focused on the ""long tail"" of smaller publishers not served by Google / Facebook / Magnite and is pushing a narrative of bringing header bidding to CTV as a means to penetrate that vertical (we are skeptical).
So what is DSP / Viant's story? In a nutshell, DSP claims to have developed a superior user targeting solution as compared to TTD, LiveRamp and others that will perform well once IDFA goes into effect and cookies / mobile ID go away. Given Viant's lack of investment in R&D (again, just $2.5m / quarter) and low brand awareness of its product (branded ""Adelphic"") throughout the industry, we are very skeptical of these claims. TTD's universal ID and LiveRamp IdentityLink are backed by years and tens of millions of dollars of investment, and command partnerships throughout the industry, and we hear good feedback on Magnite's publisher-based audience solution too. Meanwhile the Viant / Adelphic identity solution is unproven and a version 1.0, all hype and no substance. Worse still, in dozens of industry calls and channel checks, we have never once heard of DSP or Adelphic mentioned as a leader in the industry. We have invested in this sector for a long time and track it actively (see our prior comments on the timely write-up of another VIC member on RUBI / MGNI last year), so the lack of feedback we have received on DSP for a $2.6 billion EV company is noteworthy.
The reality of DSP's business as we piece it together is (much) less exciting and warrants a far lower multiple: We believe Adelphic is a tier-2 DSP with perhaps 1 - 2 points of market share, drastically subscale as compared to Google / Amazon / Facebook and Trade Desk all of whom command double digit market shares. DSP performs well in mobile and provides good client service to smaller agencies and brands, and has a modest presence in CTV by virtue of its affiliation with streaming service Xumo, which it sold to Comcast in 2020. However, despite this connection to Comcast and we believe contrary to sell-side beliefs, DSP is not an integrated partner of Comcast's Freewheel SSP, meaning DSP is likely to actually lose share in CTV over the course of 2021.
In direct contradiction to its claims about its identity solution, our checks suggest DSP is actually overindexed to the areas of spend MOST reliant on cookies, including mobile web and app, where mobile device IDs are likely to be phased out for advertising purposes while chrome is eliminating cookies. DSP even acknowledges the risks of cookie and mobile ID deprecation in its 10-K and S-1, all while boasting that this industry shift is a positive for its business.
Lastly, while DSP called out 70% growth from CTV in Q4, the company does not break out absolute CTV revenue, so we can't even attempt an SOTP on that basis. However, the fact that DSP's CTV grew 70% in Q4 but total revenue grew only 19% ex-TAC implies that it must not be very large and / or the base business is struggling. Guidance for Q1 of 11 - 14% is, again, exceedingly poor compared to competitors. DSP wants to be compared to TTD, but TTD's business grew 48% YoY in Q4 and its CTV grew 100% on a much larger base. 
Valuation: We think Street FY22 is not far off what DSP may actually do if the identity environment does not deteriorate too rapidly (245m in headline revenues and 166m ex-TAC, with EBITDA in the $30 - $40m range). We strongly believe this asset should trade at a discount to other AdTech assets for slower growth, higher competitive risks, and lack of differentiated technology or usage. Applying 5x forward revs / 25x EBITDA gets us to $19 / share, however if DSP misses numbers at any point all bets are off. Management (CEO and COO Vanderhook brothers) also owns more than 50% of shares and are highly likely to be sellers after the 180 lock-up ends in August. 
Risk factors:
Only ~10m shares out of 60 outstanding are floated making the stock a volatile and illiquid trader and 10% moves are not uncommon. S3 short interest is currently very low however at <5% of the float and <1% of true shares outstanding. The insiders / Vanderhooks have a strong motive to keep the shares trading at high levels until they can sell in August, so that is something to be cognizant of. 
Bill Hwang could get a capital infusion and vwap the stock to $100 (somebody was definitely moving it up on no volume yesterday to paint the tape). If Nomura, Credit Suisse and Goldman file 13-Gs, consider covering the short until his next margin call. 
                                         I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

Overview:
  Mueller Water Products, Inc. (“Mueller,” “MWA,” or “the Company”) is an under the radar and misunderstood pure play water infrastructure company trading at a nearly 50% discount to peers. The water industry is an attractive business and Mueller has an extremely strong competitive position with the #1 or #2 market position in its key product categories. In our view, Mueller will be the beneficiary of several multi-decade tailwinds including the increasing failure rates of public water infrastructure (water main breaks, etc.) due to an aging water infrastructure and the ongoing digitization of water infrastructure, which is likely to accelerate in a post-pandemic environment due to municipalities’ increased desire/need to monitor their assets remotely. In addition to significant long term growth drivers, Mueller should be aided in the near/intermediate term by the potential for increased federal spending associated with water infrastructure projects (spending on water projects is a key component of the proposed federal stimulus) and residential construction, which is experiencing strong growth following 10+ years of residential housing underbuilding in the wake of the Great Recession. 


Company Description and Background:
  Mueller is a leading manufacturer and marketer of products and services used to transmit, distribute, and measure water in North America. We see Mueller as well positioned in this attractive industry (repair and replacement comprise ~two thirds of its net sales), with more than 75% of its net sales generated from products that hold the #1 or #2 market share position in their respective categories. During FY 2020, MWA generated $964 million in net sales: $886 million (or 92%) from its Infrastructure segment (hydrants, valves, etc.) and $79 million (or 8%) from its Technologies segment (digital meters, pipe assessment and leak detection products, etc.).
  Mueller was founded in 1857 in Decatur, Illinois, by Hieronymus Mueller, a German immigrant who built a career as an inventor and entrepreneur. During the Company‘s early years, Mr. Mueller and his sons created a number of products ranging from sporting goods to faucets and obtained over 500 patents for their various inventions. They eventually began focusing on water distribution products, having invented water pressure regulators, the first sanitary drinking fountain, and a method for “hot tapping” pressurized water and gas lines using a machine that remains the industry standard to this day with only slight modifications. 
  Mueller has been shaped by a number of acquisitions since its founding. In 1933, Mueller acquired Columbia Iron Works, which produced fire hydrants and large gate valves, and by 1955 it changed the Columbia name to Mueller. In 1996, Mueller, then a subsidiary of Tyco International, acquired Henry Pratt (valves, valve actuators, and control systems) and the James Jones Company (fire hydrants and valves). In 2001, the Company acquired Hydro Gate (sluice gate valve manufacturer), which it followed with the 2003 acquisition of Milliken Valve, a plug manufacturer. 
  The business that constitutes Mueller has changed hands a number of times over the past ~30 years. In 1998, industrial conglomerate Tyco paid $350 million for Mueller Company, making Tyco a leading player in flow control products. In 1999, DLJ‘s merchant banking unit acquired portions of Tyco‘s flow control division, including the Mueller Company, Grinnell Supply Sales, Grinnell Manufacturing, and Henry Pratt Company, from Tyco for $938 million. Under the auspices of DLJ, Mueller took a number of actions to increase its manufacturing capacity, reduce operating costs, enhance operating efficiencies, and boost overall profitability. Seeking an exit from its investment, DLJ considered several monetization events for its Mueller stake and even considered taking the Company public, filing an S-1 for the business in 2004. However, Walter Industries emerged as an acquirer in 2005, paying $1.9 billion for Mueller, which then consisted of the Mueller and Anvil divisions. These businesses were combined with Walter Industries‘ existing U.S. Pipe operations to form Mueller Water Products. In May 2006, Walter Industries completed a partial IPO (~25% stake) for the Mueller business at $16 per share and then distributed the remaining Mueller shares to its existing Walter Industries shareholders in December 2006. 


Why Does This Opportunity Exist?:
  Significant capital investment: Mueller is currently in the midst of a heavy capital investment cycle intended to drive growth and improve profitability. Mueller arguably underinvested in its business in the first ~10 years after its 2006 IPO as it was primarily focused on delevering, paying down more than $1 billion in debt. Under the leadership of MWA’s CEO Scott Hall who joined the Company in 2017 from Textron, the Company has pivoted from debt pay down to improving profitability by upgrading its facilities that will enable the Company to consolidate its manufacturing footprint, improve its market position in a key valve category (where it currently has the #2 market position) and realize other efficiencies. The modernization is expected to generate an incremental $30 million annual gross profit improvement from both revenue and cost synergies by ~FY 2023. However, the upgrade is not without its costs and capex has been elevated in recent years.  Following the modernization initiative, capex is expected to decline to less than 4% of sales (vs. ~7% in FY 2021) when its new brass foundry in Decatur, IL is completed in ~FY 2022/FY 2023
  Unprofitable technologies segment: Mueller has been investing heavily within its Technologies segment to develop products that utilities can use to monitor their systems. MWA’s fledgling Sentryx platform (SaaS revenue component) is a promising new platform with significant growth potential that enables utilities to monitor their entire water infrastructure. Mueller’s tech investments have masked its true level of profitability, with ~$67 million in cumulative segment operating losses over the past 4 fiscal years (FY 2017-FY 2020). However, with the segment on the cusp of sustained profitability, MWA should experience improved free cash flow generation. Although COVID-19 is pressuring MWA’s digital businesses in the near term (through an inability to install meters at customers’ homes), the pandemic could accelerate future digital adoption, as water utilities will likely desire to have greater resilience against future shocks (so that remote monitoring capabilities, etc., are in greater demand). 
  Misunderstood: Shortly after its 2006 IPO, the residential construction market accounted for ~50% of Mueller’s business. In addition to its residential construction exposure, Mueller had exposure to a number of other cyclical end markets (oil and gas, etc.). However, following the 2012 divestitures including U.S. Pipe (2012: Non residential construction) and Anvil (2017: oil and gas, among others) coupled with the acquisition of Singer Valve (2017: automatic control valves for the water industry) and Krausz (2018: repair tools for the water industry) Mueller has narrowed its focus on the water industry while retaining a less cyclical and more profitable business. 
  Overlooked: Mueller is not included in any of the major S&P indices. However, we see no rationale for the exclusion and believe that the prospect for inclusion could enable the Company to attract a wider investor base and therefore the potential to garner a higher multiple, closing the valuation gap with its peers. 
  Pensions and tax overhangs: Mueller has successfully resolved meaningful tax and pension issues in recent years, which previously served as a significant overhang for the shares. It’s possible that the resolution of these items is still not appreciated by investors. 


Competitive Advantages:
  Strong brands and large and growing installed base: Mueller is the most recognized brand in the North American water infrastructure market. As already noted, Mueller boasts the #1 or #2 market share position in all its key product categories. The Company has also built a leading install base of its products, with many of its brands having 100 years of history or more. The Company‘s 2006 S-1 filing stated that over 3 million fire hydrants and 9 million iron gate valves bore one of the company‘s brand names, and we suspect that industry penetration has risen even higher since the IPO (~15 years ago) due to the Company‘s leading market share. The following statement from Mueller‘s 10-K filing helps reinforce the importance of the Company‘s install base: “Most municipalities have approved a limited number of fire hydrant brands for installation within their systems due to their desires to use the same tools and operating instructions across their systems and to minimize inventories of spare parts.” Accordingly, it is extremely difficult for a new entrant to make inroads in this mature industry, and brand recognition is very important: customers are very slow to transition to brands other than their historically preferred brand. As a result of these dynamics, and the favorable industry landscape (discussed later) Mueller enjoys good pricing power with its utility customers. 
  Advanced/low-cost manufacturing: During the early 2000s, Mueller invested heavily in its manufacturing, seeking to become the industry‘s low-cost provider. Between 2000 and 2002 Mueller invested $124 million to implement low-cost manufacturing technologies, including the lost foam casting process used to manufacture its hydrants and many other products. In addition to the favorable cost benefits (reduced need for machining operations), this process also offers favorable performance attributes (production of high-quality products) and environmental attributes (reduced water usage and energy usage, etc.). Notably, MWA is the only company in the industry with lost foam technology capabilities. 
  Customer relationships and product specifications: MWA boasts long-term relationships with its key customers. A number of these relationships have been in existence for a very long time. For example, New York City has used the Company‘s products for over 150 years, and cities such as Boston and Chicago have been using them for over 100 years. A key factor in sustaining these long-term customer relationships is product specifications. It generally takes 1 year to receive product specifications from a municipality, though in some cases securing customer approval for a particular product has taken more than 5 years. With 50,000 water utilities and more than 14,000 wastewater utilities in the U.S. and Canada, the approval process is a cumbersome one that any new entrant would find daunting. Although a 1-year approval period is clearly not an insurmountable barrier to entry, the existing players, which have already received their product specifications and have a large installed base, enjoy certain benefits. During a 2018 investor conference, MWA CFO Marietta Zakas stated that once a municipality adopts a product, “they‘ll tend to replace it with like for like.” MWA‘s most recent 10-K filing notes that Mueller‘s iron gate valve or fire hydrant products are specified for use in the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the United States. During FY 2019, the Company‘s valves and hydrant products represented ~80% of the Company‘s FY 2019 sales. 


Key Investment Considerations:
  Favorable competitive landscape: Mueller’s infrastructure segment operates in an industry whose favorable competitive landscape offers several long-term tailwinds. The oligopoly composition of the water infrastructure market in which MWA competes has resulted in a rational pricing environment and has enabled MWA to command good pricing power and generate strong margins (FY 2020 Adj. EBITDA margin: 19.8%). Mueller has a large install base (over 3 million hydrants and 9 million gate valves), and its customers, a number of which have been using MWA’s products for over 100 years, are unlikely to switch manufacturers after products are installed, lest doing so require new tools and spare parts. In addition to the moat established from its large install base, the nature of the Company’s products (bulky, heavy, etc.) helps to insulate it from foreign competition. 
  Aging water Infrastructure: In the U.S., more than 2 trillion gallons of treated water is lost annually, for reasons ranging from leaks to water main breaks. The average age of water pipes in the U.S. has increased to 45 years in 2020, up from 25 years in 1970. According to a study by the American Water Works Association, restoring the existing water systems and expanding them to serve a growing population through 2050 will require a $1.7 trillion investment. We believe that Mueller will be a beneficiary of this potential industry spending given its strong competitive position.The prospect for approval of a federal stimulus to address the industry’s problems could also provide a nice tailwind for the Company although this would not be something that should be counted on for an immediate financial impact (delay in deploying funds to states, etc.).
  Increasing failure rates: Water infrastructure spending is typically not a discretionary item, especially if the infrastructure fails or is unable to deliver safe, clean drinking water to a municipality‘s consumers. The number of failures per 100 miles of infrastructure has increased by 27%, from 11 breaks per 100 miles in 2014 to 14 breaks per 100 miles in 2018. Perhaps more troubling, the breakage rates of cast iron and asbestos cement pipe, which constitute 41% of the installed water mains in the U.S. and Canada, have increased by more than 40% over the 2012-2018 time frame. The average ages of a failing water main (~50 years) and of the water infrastructure (45 years) suggest that failures will continue to increase going forward.
  Residential housing growth: In the wake of the housing crisis, new construction has not kept up with demand. According to Realtor.com, just 5.9 million single-family homes were built between 2012 and 2019, well below the 9.8 million household formations over that time frame. Such underbuilding, coupled with record low interest rates, has created significant pent-up demand for housing, which should drive strong levels of new construction going forward (more housing communities, more hydrants, valves, etc.). According to a recent report by the National Association of Realtors, new home construction in the past 20 years was 5.5 million units below long-term historic levels. The low current housing inventory reinforces the view of the significant underbuilding. At the end of May 2021, there was just a 2.5 month supply of homes on the market (at current sales pace), well below the typical 6-9 months supply. 
  Digitization of water infrastructure: We believe the ongoing digitization of the water utility industry will accelerate in the wake of the pandemic and Mueller is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this trend. Mueller has been investing heavily within its technology segment to develop products that utilities can use to monitor their systems. MWA’s fledgling Sentryx platform (SaaS revenue component) is a promising new platform with significant growth potential that enables utilities to monitor their entire water infrastructure. Mueller noted recently that it continues to convert existing customers to its Sentryx software platform, which is expected to facilitate additional digital sales to existing customers. Although COVID-19 is pressuring MWA’s digital businesses in the near term (through an inability to install meters at customers’ homes), the pandemic could accelerate future digital adoption, as water utilities will likely desire to have greater resilience against future shocks. A 2019 report by industry researcher Bluefield Research projected that the digital water market will increase at a 6.5% annual rate between 2019 and 2030. However, Bluefield noted in April 2020 that COVID-19 will likely pull forward the digital transition by ~2-3 years (despite some near-term pressure on digital revenues as a result of the pandemic, such as delay in installing/adopting meters that require access to consumers‘ homes), resulting in annual growth rate of 8.7% through 2030, compared with its prior projection of 6.5% growth. Although MWA’s cost structure has benefited from lower travel related expenses, trade shows and the like remain a key component of the sales process for Mueller, especially for digital technologies, as it provides an opportunity for water utilities to network with each, which ultimately tends to spur adoption of new technologies. Accordingly, the reopening of economies, and increased business travel that will likely occour as the pandemic fades, should have a favorable impact on future results. 
  Strong balance sheet and cash flow generating abilities: MWA boasts an extremely strong balance sheet, with leverage (net debt/Adj. EBITDA) of just 1.1x and no L-T debt maturities until 2026. Since its 2006 IPO, MWA has paid down over $1 billion in debt—a testament to MWA’s strong cash flow generating abilities. MWA has recently addressed two significant overhangs on its shares, including pension and tax liabilities. Its improved financial position has also given it the flexibility to pursue acquisitions, invest in the manufacturing capabilities needed to drive future growth, and return value to shareholders. MWA’s FY 2020 results were not immune to the pandemic but held up well, with FY 2020 net sales and adj. EBITDA declining by just 0.4% and 3.8%, respectively. (In 3Q FY 2020 net sales and adj. EBITDA were down 17% and 33%, respectively.) However, in November 2020 after a better than expected 4Q FY 2020 and a strong FY 2021 outlook for sales and adjusted EBITDA (net sales expected to be between flat and up 3% with adjusted EBITDA forecast to increase between 4% and 7%), MWA reinstated its share buyback program ($145 million outstanding) on the heels of a 5% dividend increase (yield: 1.6%) announced in October 2020. It should be noted that MWA has increased its FY 2021 outlook twice since initially communicating it in November 2021 with consolidated net sales now expected to increase by 8-10% and adjusted EBITDA to be up 9-12%. Although MWA has not repurchased any shares through the first six months of FY 2021, we would not be surprised to see MWA begin to repurchases shares aggressively and/or continue increasing its dividend, especially as the pandemic wanes.  


Valuation:
  At current levels, Mueller trades at ~12x trailing EBITDA, which is on par with recent precedent industry transactions, which have occurred at an average of 11.2x on an EV/EBITDA basis. However, MWA trades at a large discount to publicly traded peers, which sell for over 20x. It should be noted that Mueller’s trailing EBITDA represents somewhat of a depressed level as it includes pandemic related weakness. It should also be noted that Mueller‘s EBITDA margins (~20%) are in line with the average of its publicly traded peers‘. 


Risks and Mitigants:
  State and Local Government Pressures: The prospect for lower tax receipts and local water revenue could have an impact on the project-related portion of the municipal market (~10% of MWA's net sales). However, the strength of the residential housing market is expected to more than offset the pressure in the project portion of the market. Longer term, municipal water spending budgets are expected to increase meaningfully. During MWA’s 2Q FY 2021 earnings call, Mueller CEO Scott Hall stated, “But I still think in front of us the same thing I've been saying for the last three or four years is that budgets by necessity will have to increase. I think we'll have some timing bumps over the next 5 to 10-year horizon. But water infrastructure, wastewater, wastewater infrastructure, storm water and storm water management and retention of storm water all are going to face 100 basis points, 150 basis points, 200 basis points better than GDP spending into the foreseeable future to kind of fix the mass we created. And so, I think you'll see a dip in the near-term, but in the 5 to 10-year windows – 5 and 10-year windows, budgets have to increase in all three of those.”
  Unfavorable/large acquisition: Although the risk that MWA completes a pricey acquisition is possible, we note that management appears very disciplined in their approach to acquisitions. In 2018, Mueller CEO Scott Hall noted to industry publication Global Water Intelligence, “We‘ve seen some pretty crazy valuations in the technology space, but as a responsible player in the market, we‘re not just going to pay any multiple that somebody dreams up. You would have to believe in some fairly healthy adoption rates in what has been a traditionally slow-moving industry—as well as low interest rates for a very long time—to justify those sorts of valuations.” Subsequent to the end of 2Q FY 2021, MWA announced a small $20 million acquisition to bolster its digital capabilities. Although the multiple paid can’t be determined at this point, the acquired business looks complementary (pressure management solutions) to the Company’s portfolio and expands MWA’s digital monitoring capabilities. 
  Distributor concentration: Mueller derives a large percentage of its sales from its top distributors. In fact, the Company’s two largest distributors accounted for 35% of the Infrastructure segment gross sales in FY 2020. Although Mueller does not have long term contracts with its distributors, it has long term relationships with its partners spanning multiple decades. It’s also worth noting that the distributors have an interest in maintaining a relationship with Mueller in order to participate in future growth opportunities, especially in digital products. For example, Mueller recently worked with its top distributor Ferguson in securing a multi-year contract for an advanced metering infrastructure product. 
  Commodity Inflation: Mueller is currently dealing with commodity price inflation. However, the Company has recently implemented price increases across a majority of its products that are expected to more than offset the impact of inflation and aid margins.

2005-01-01,danarb860,IN,Infosys Technologies,https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/Infosys_Technologies/9938724715,12700000000.0,2089.0,"Description
My recommendation is setting up the Infosys Technologies share class arbitrage.

The $12.7bn capitalization for Infosys I have listed in the idea specifications is its capitalization in the Indian market. The capitalization in the US market as is $18.7bn.

The reason for this discrepancy is that the ADR is trading at just under a 45% premium to the underlying ordinary share equivalent. Naturally, one can freely convert ADR’s to ordinary shares (nobody would) but not the other way around.

The ordinary closed in India under ticker INFO IN at an Indian Rupee price of 2089 INR (INR being Indian Rupees). At a rupee dollar exchange rate of .0229 dollars to the rupee and 1 ADR/ordinary share, that equates to $47.83. INFY, the US ADR closed at $69.31.

My recommendation is to set up the share class trade, buying the Indian ordinary and shorting the ADR. As for the ratio, I will address that in further detail below. For the moment, I suggest trading it at a range between roughly equal dollar amount on the long and short to 5-10% net long market value.

Infosys is not the only Indian company where there is a big differential, and others are interesting as well. There is Wipro, Satyam, HDFC Bank, State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, plus other existing and future ones. As a general principle, over time, as the ADR’s and ordinaries are identical economic instruments, I believe they will inevitably gravitate to parity. This year alone, the INFY premium has ranged from 34% to 68%, and the range has been wider than that over time.

But I feel that the timing is right, and that INFY is the best name in which to invest.

Such market inefficiencies can exist for a long time and trade anywhere until their likely resting point of parity is reached. In addition to the lack of convertibility as listed above, there are a number of reasons for the difference in prices. 1) There is a limited supply of the ADRs, currently only $1bn worth of INFY at US dollar prices. This is a relatively small float in relation to the size of Infosys ($18bn) and the amount of capital available to invest in the company. For many investors, the US ADR is the only way to gain access to the company so the ADR has a scarcity value. Until recently, there were also foreign ownership ceilings in India for the company. Additionally, it is difficult, to own the local shares. Consequently, the ADRs and ordinaries do functionally trade to a certain extent as somewhat unrelated securities with different potential investors. A Goldman report earlier this year actually suggested that the ADRs should trade at a premium to the underlying ordinary shares as the cost of capital is lower in the US.

As for buying the ordinary share, in all Indian companies, to buy them directly, one needs to register as an FII, Foreign Institutional Investor. It is not easy to do, and it seems impossible to do if you are a Hedge Fund…. for now. Suffice to say that SEBI, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (their SEC) wrestles with the role of hedge funds in the market. Without going into too much detail, the issue has to do with the concern that Non-Resident Indians (NRI’s) would use their own created hedge funds which maintain their anonymity to funnel money back into the market, potentially in a manipulative fashion. So for all practical purposes, for the moment, the only way to buy the ordinary share is on swap (P-Notes as they are called in India, where P stands for Participating). This further weeds out potential buyers of the ordinary shares as not everybody can buy on swap. Finally, earlier this year, SEBI essentially ruled that in order to buy p-Notes, the fund, its GP, or Advisor had to be registered somewhere, even if only in its home jurisdiction, further weeding out potential buyers for ordinary shares. In short, there is a form of administrative geopolitical risk to owning the local shares as SEBI could always change the nature of the playing field.

The above factors seem to explain why the local and ADR shares have and continue to trade at such different values. But the situation is changing both on the short and long side of the trade.

First, on the short side, Indian companies are planning more ADR issuances. INFY is one of those companies that have announced one (more on this below). The companies are beginning to want to take advantage of the valuation discrepancies. Additionally, given the mechanics of the offerings, the offerings permit insiders to sell stock at a premium price. As managements of the companies are becoming more financially sophisticated, we believe that this trend will continue. Having a greater supply of ADR’s will tend to reduce the scarcity of the ADRs by increasing supply, which should help to reduce the premium. It also reduces the risk of a short squeeze and the premiums blowing out to further extreme levels (as was seen in the past).

Additionally, as these companies have greatly increased their market caps over the past two years, the risk of huge moves to the upside on the short side is reduced. It is harder for an $18bn company with real earnings to move to an extreme valuation as opposed to an earlier stage and smaller capitalization company.

On the long side of the trade for the local shares, it has been (although not in a straight line) and will likely become easier over time for foreigners to buy the local shares. Foreign ownership limits have been and continue to be raised. The government is working on starting to make it easier to get registered as an FII and has stated informally that over time that it expects to allow hedge funds to register. Big picture, over time, as in many other developing markets, financial markets will increasingly open. As does any developing and rapidly growing country, the need to drive the cost of capital as low as possible seems likely to inevitably lead to a more open market-- although this is clearly one of the risks on the long side of the trade and potentially the spread trade as well.

While it is unlikely that the shares will be fully fungible for quite some time, I believe that it will become increasingly easy to buy the local shares, and that as this happens, demand for the local shares will increase relative to the ADRs. I will point out that as an offset, while the long-term capital gains in India is 0, there is a 10% short-term capital gains tax. While one gets a credit on this, it is a disincentive to investing directly in India. There is no tax on the swaps as the counter-parties that own the securities are domiciled in Mauritius, which has a tax treaty with India.

Additionally, if one steps back and considers the situation from the vantage points of the company managements, particularly for information technology companies that have substantial customer bases, this kind of market price discrepancy is inefficient from a capital market point of view and does not necessarily project the kind of image that these companies want.

Turning to Infosys, this company has a blue-chip, world-wide customer base including very substantial business with US Fortune 500 corporations. It wants to raise capital as efficiently as possible and be perceived as an equal to its customers. The share structure is not consistent with this and should over time lead management to push for convergence. Reflecting this, as well as its apparent desire to join the NASDAQ 100, INFY is about to issue an extra $1bn of ADR’s doubling the float. Unless the ADR continues its substantial appreciation, it will likely have to issue another $1bn over the next 18 months to 2 years to get into the index.

Of all the companies, Infosys has been and seems to continue to be the company that is most aggressive in managing its capital structure. It is doing an issuance now, and it also did one in July of 2003. No other company has sold this much ADR value. Consequently, this company also has the biggest ADR float, and it also trades the highest volume. Combined with another potential issuance out a year to 18 months, this seems to be the safest ADR from the vantage point of not getting squeezed on the short side, and it is also the easiest to trade.

Neither Infosys’ 2003 offering nor this offering will increase the number of shares outstanding. What did and will actually happen is that ordinary holders in effect tender their ordinary shares into the ADR offering in exchange for ADRs and then sell the as ADRs through the offering. The end result will be more ADR and fewer ordinary shares outstanding, a good result if one is long ordinary shares and short ADRs. (Given that Infosys’ management is among the more financially sophisticated, and these offerings provide an opportunity to sell ordinary shares at a premium, management is likely motivated to continue these kinds of transactions.) Consequently, this trade could be timely since, if one owns the local shares before the Q1 offering, one can tender these shares into the offering. Hopefully, this result is not fully discounted by the market.

The mechanics of the offering are unclear and may not yield the same pro-rate for all investors. 6% of the local shares will be exchanged. In 2003, your pro-rate was determined by the total amount of your holdings, not what you tendered. For those owning shares on swap, it is the total holdings of the counter-party that count (assuming it is done the same way again this time). As such, it is not clear what one’s pro-rate will be, and it could be less than 6%, an atypical outcome.

Of course, some shares will certainly be sold. It is for this reason that I recommend setting up the trade slightly net long capital. Share class trades are generally set up somewhere between one share short for each share long (a net capital short position) to an equal dollar weighted, the latter being the pure way to invest in the percentage change of premium thesis. Given my view that Infosys has excellent long-term prospects, were there not a tender upcoming and then certainly post tender, I would suggest setting this trade up on an equal dollar basis. Historically, these trades tend to make the most money in weak tapes, and this has certainly been the case for the Indian ADR/ordinary trades. Stated differently, the ADR and local tend to move in the same direction even in the short term, but given the smaller float, the ADR tends to have bigger percentage moves. As the spread is volatile, I tend to like to trade the volatility for some portion of my position while not disturbing the core investment.

Infosys provides a full range of IT consulting and software services; essentially, it is one of the major outsourcers. INFO IN is trading at 21x projected 3/06 earnings and the INFY is trading at a nearly 32 PE. The company is growing rapidly and is substantially cash-flow positive. The one danger in setting the trade up and not being net short is the possibility that the stocks go down substantially, in which case no money will be made. The company is extremely well run and in a great space. As such, I don’t think there is a major risk of a large decline. On the other hand, I am cautious about being too much net long here as labor market competition in India is putting extraordinary pressure on wages, and the rise of the Indian Rupee against the dollar is also a headwind.

To answer an obvious question, Indian companies that buy back stock cannot reissue them for at least 12 months, thus precluding the company selling ADRs and buying back ordinary shares. (I would expect that over time, the companies will give more thought to this Western type of financial engineering, but based on conversations, it is not something to expect in the near-term.)

To summarize, here is an opportunity to buy and sell the same economic instrument at a price difference of about 45%. There is no apparent “economic risk” to the trade (although never say never). The risks are market, timing, legal, and technical. With patience, perhaps a lot, a substantially favorable outcome seems highly likely.

A stupid sounding company name/bobble head dolls/worst IPO in 17 years/class action lawsuit/microcap/”Up C” Structure/debt on the balance sheet.  Ugh! Run Away! Just hearing those things should have most investors ignoring this company. They have. That being said, Funko presents a compelling opportunity which is not easily appreciated.  
  Investment Summary
  Funko is a compelling opportunity as investors remain skeptical of the sustainability of their business, and some near term fears over the Toys R Us liquidation.  We feel the company is significantly undervalued and believe the shares to be worth $15/ share, nearly double from here.

Business Description
  Headquartered in Everett, Washington, Funko is a leading pop culture consumer products company. Funko designs, sources and distributes licensed pop culture products across multiple categories, including vinyl figures, action toys, plush, apparel, housewares and accessories for consumers who seek tangible ways to connect with their favorite pop culture brands and characters. 
  A Passing Fad or a Durable Business Model?
  Beanie Babies, Cabbage Patch Dolls, Fidget Spinners.  Fads come and go and they create enormous excitement and big ramp in sales.  But then after awhile, saturation occurs, consumer tastes change and sales become a small fraction of what they once were.  Funko has clearly demonstrated enormous sales growth which suggest its products are a fad. However, we believe that the products sold by Funko piggyback on a much broader and deeper secular trend in media and entertainment.


Pop Culture is evolving and growing
  One of the toughest concepts for investors to embrace in Funko is that the company is not a “one trick pony”.  About 60% of the company revenues comes from the sales of its Pop! Vinyl product line. They are similar in appearance to bobble heads (see below)
       With the proliferation and growth of digital entertainment content, such as Youtube, Netflix, Amazon, Facebook, multiplayer video games, there is a huge pool of entertainment properties for consumers, and consumers are embracing and are following their favorite brands more than ever.  Consumers can watch at home, on mobile devices any time of the day. They can follow their favorite shows or characters on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Following your favorite character or brand has never been easier or more socially acceptable. The collectibles market today is much more than geeks collecting batman figures.  It is much more mainstream.
  Not One Brand-Funko Leverages Broad Entertainment Content
  Another misconception about Funko is that this is not just about the Funko brand.  Funko leverages content across hundreds of brands through licensing contracts. Therefore its products don’t rely on one branded product to survive such as other toy properties, such at Barbie, Cabbage Patch, GI Joe etc. 
  Proven Expertise in Speed to Market
  One of the keys to Funko’s success is their ability to get the right products to market in a short time frame.  This is a key differentiator for the business. Due to its in-house capabilities, including design and prototyping, as well as significant leverage with 3rd party manufacturers, Funko is able to get products to market quicker than other competitors.  They have the ability to get a concept to a store shelf (virtual or bricks and mortar) in 70 days. This allows them to capture changing current events quickly and it helps avoid keeping large amounts of inventory in stock.
  No Brainer for Licensors
  Many licensors don’t have the interest or resources to pursue selling figurines for their developed content.  It is not their core competency. However, by partnering with Funko, they not only 1) receive cash (Funko pays licensors around 15% royalties on sales), but  they 2) further bolster their existing brand following and bring in new followers.  


Growth Opportunities
  Funko should benefit from additional shelf space from existing retailers due the recent success.
International Expansion.  Funko products are underselling outside the US.  While Funko generated only about 20% of its sales outside the US, its content partners generate 40% of its traditional merchandise outside the US, and 80% of movie receipts outside the US.  
New domestic distribution channels.  Funko has recently begun programs modestly with some drugstore and grocery store chains.  But there is huge opportunity to grow.
E-commerce or selling direct.  Currently Funko is generating just 6% of sales direct to consumer.  
New Licenses/New Products.  Though hard to forecast the growth from a new license partner can be substantial.  
  IPO Disaster
  It was a perfect storm of destruction that took the price down to these levels.  Initial price talk was $14-16/share, it ended up pricing at $12/ share and closed at $7.07, or over 50% down from its original price talk.  One of the reasons, was due to simply poor investment banking. But Funko was also subject to a hit piece during its IPO from the Bloomberg Gadfly entitled “Funko Extends its Playtime to Accounting-IPO Prospectus gives a lesson in Make Believe.  
  https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2017-11-02/funko-ipo-maker-of-dolls-extends-playtime-to-accounting
  The article as you can see is very cursory and takes shots at proforma one time costs, such as acquisition and corporate headquarters buildout.  It is very common for private companies to have proforma adjustments for an IPO. I agree that you shouldn’t take every adjustment that a company makes in their proforma financials.  But I think this article took adjustments that were somewhat normal, and had fun with them to an exaggerated effect with fun puns like “fun house accounting”. The net result was a total IPO disaster that Funko is fighting out of.

  Currently shares trade at about 6.1X 2018 EBITDA, and 5.1X 2019 EBITDA.  Our target price for the company is $15/share which is about 8X 2019 EBITDA.
  The closest comp in the space is Spinmaster  (TOY CN) in our opinion. Like Funko, it is a smaller growth oriented toy manufacturer.  It trades for about 12X EBITDA.

  While not the key driver of value for the company, it is worth pointing out the the company came public as an Up C structure which is designed to reduce taxes for both the private owners prior to the IPO and the company to a lesser degree.  While this writeup will not go into the details of the cash flow and tax structure of this arrangement, simply put, the company will make cash payments back to the private equity owners and in return, they will be able to shield itself from future taxable taxes that it would have had to pay.  Essentially, the company creates a deferred tax asset on the balance sheet. The upshot of this I believe has created additional noise to the detriment of valuation.



Risks
  -Dependence on the content of other companies’ brands.  Funko is susceptible to the changing popularity of its customers’ brands.  What might be hot one year might be not hot the next year. That being said Funko has relationships with over 125 content owners and has a library of over 1000 licensed products.   It largest relationships are with Warner Brothers, Marvel, Disney and Lucasfilm. Funko has never lost a license.
  -Royalty rates.  Funko May have to pay higher royalty rates for more popular content.
  -Brick and mortar traffic decline.  Currently approximately 80% of revenue is generated by physical store retailers.  32% of sales were made to specialty retail such as Gamestop, Hot Topic etc. While another 18% of sales are made to mass retail such as Walmart, Target etc.  One risk that should be kept in mind is that approximately 3% of sales is made to Toys R Us which is closing down. 
  -Sourcing and raw materials.  While Funko has demonstrated its adept ability in sourcing products quickly and efficiently, it is still subject to moving prices in labor and resin prices in Asia. Currently Funko sources about 50% of product from Vietnam and Funko is hedged in the berm term from resin fluctuation.
  Catalysts
  Execution of company estimates.  Because the IPO was such a bust, there is a low bar set for Funko.  Simply demonstrating that this is a real business that can be predictable will bolster the valuation of the company.
  New major license agreement.
  Acquisition by a larger toy company.  Funko is one of the few exceptions to an otherwise tougher environment for toy companies.

2010-04-09,lys615,KMX,CarMax,https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/CarMax/3116568530,5460000000.0,24.6,"Description
  Short - CarMax (KMX - $24.60)
How much should an investor pay for two spread businesses disguised as a used car retailer?  Below, we will attempt to show the case for a valuation substantially less than $24.60 and thus we present this idea as a short.
CarMax operates 100 used vehicle superstores primarily in the southern half of the United States.  The company was spun out of Circuit City in 2002 and has been operating a rapid store growth strategy since then (with the exception of FY2010 ending Feb28).  In fact, they've gone from 35 stores back then to the current store base of 100 units.  As you can imagine, sell-side analysts are impressed with the high growth rates.
Bull Case
CarMax has a unique set of competitive advantages because they have scale economics in an industry where the end product is not fungible (every used car is different) and with their small market share they could grow indefinitely.  If you need any proof of the growth obsession, check out the stock price after the latest earnings release in which they announced their planned store growth resumption after a near death experience in FY2009.  Indeed, the Merrill research report after the Q4 earnings was titled ""4Q blooms, growth is on the way"". 
Growth is great if you have a good business.  In this case, we argue that CarMax is a combination of two mediocre businesses. 
Used Car Business
New car dealers like the used car business because it allows them to make money on several transactions when a customer decides to buy a car.  They make a small profit on the new car, they make a profit on the customer's trade (used car), they line up a customer for the parts & service business, and they typically make money on the F&I business (selling warranties, providing financing, etc.).  CarMax has two of these pieces, they make money on the used car transaction and on financing (I'll discuss the financing later).  The trouble is that without the parts & service annuity that comes by operating a P&S business, selling cars just isn't that great.
Currently, three factors make the used car business look reasonably good.  First, there is an enormous volume lift from the depths of the Great Recession a year ago.  This higher traffic and still low SG&A costs are helping lift margins (SG&A as a % of gross profit dropped several percentage points in FY2010 setting an all-time low).  Second, there has been an increase in used car prices over the past year thanks to Cash for Clunkers.  A third factor driving rising used prices is the radical production cuts made by automakers last year.  Those production decisions have favorably impacted supply though I suspect that will be temporary given the global overcapacity of auto manufacturing.
Manheim Consulting publishes a monthly report on used car prices and they've enjoyed a tremendous spike of late though over time they've not moved much (I can't get the graph to paste -- the index stood at 115 in Feb 2002 and is at 118 now -- though it has risen 12% this past year).
This is important because the weakness of the used car business is the speed at which your inventory declines in value.  During the past year though, it has been a major tailwind.  Used car prices were up 12% in the latest fiscal year for CarMax, so their spread between acquisition cost and sales price has widened recently instead of getting smaller.  Of course the company must replenish their inventory with higher priced vehicles, so this tailwind will become a headwind at some point and will shrink margins.  The recent return of 0% financing among OEMs, and other incentives in the new car market likely provide a sign that used car prices will soon flatten.
The bottom line is that we would argue that the CarMax used car business is simply a spread business between used car acquisition and selling prices.  As such there are precious few long-term competitive advantages to be had in this business.
CarMax Auto Finance (CAF)
The second spread business is in the form of CarMax Auto Finance.  CarMax provides financing to potential customers using their own balance sheet, though they then securitize the loans.  When a customer decides they would like to buy a used car, CarMax takes the credit application and runs it through their internal underwriting platform.  Many customers who need loans are financed that way, with the remaining non-approved applications then farmed out to a group of third-party lenders (not sure exactly why you'd want to pick up the scraps here, but that's a different discussion).  CarMax benefits in two ways - first, the CAF division is incredibly profitable over time.  Second, they provide a way for their customers to fund their car purchase and thus can more easily drive volumes.
Let's spend time on CAF profitability.  Since CarMax was spun out of Circuit City in 2002, CAF has generated $830M of pretax income.  That represents 45% of all CarMax EBIT over that period.  During that same period, CAF has reported $521M of gain on sale income from the securitization of auto loans. (The $521M is included in the $830M figure.  The rest of the income from CAF comes from servicing loans, and from the interest spread between their cost of funds and the loan interest rates).
Over this same period, the average annual managed receivables have jumped from $1.4B to $4.0B (this $4.0B number is one year old since the FY2010 Annual Report has not yet been released, though we do know the FY2010 CAF income figures).  Similarly, the retained interest in the securitizations has risen from $121M to $552M.
What's it worth?
The used car business is mediocre judging by that segment's return on capital.  Since it is impossible to calculate the ROIC with precision, we must make some estimates.  If we assume that the balance sheet, excluding the retained interest, supports the car business than it appears to us as if pretax return on capital is just under 10%.  The CAF business generates much better returns on capital, though with a unique set of risks, risks that took the shares to $6 each in 2008.
We've decided to value the pieces separately despite the fact that CAF wouldn't exist without the car business.  Let's give CarMax the benefit of the doubt and throw out FY2009 (ending Feb 28, 2009) which was an awful year on a number of fronts.  If we use the three years FY2007, FY2008, and FY2010, it appears that the used car business generates average EBIT of $230M, or just north of $1/share of EBIT, or $0.60/share after tax.  CarMax can and will grow revenues with the resumption of their store growth.  However, we believe that the marginal return on capital is not very exciting and thus the company may be economically breaking even, or worse, on new used car stores excluding finance.  Let's be generous and value such a business at 15x earnings or $9/share .
Using that same time period, CAF generated $130M of EBIT on average, or just under $0.60/share per year, roughly $0.40/share after tax.  Clearly, CAF can grow rapidly if CarMax chooses to do so... they clearly have stepped on the accelerator in the past decade.  Also, as they add a handful of stores (they've committed to opening 3 more stores this fiscal year, and between three and five next fiscal year), they can grow the lending business.  The trouble is, we would contend that this type of business isn't worth all that much.  Captive financing companies with wholesale funding sources just don't get valued too highly.   There are dozens of spread businesses in finance with better funding sources than CAF.  That said, since it can grow more quickly than most, let's be generous and say that this business should be valued at 12x earnings or $4.80/share.
Add it up, and we think that CarMax is worth more like $14 than $24.

2018-03-22,ActII,AZZ,AZZ INC,https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/AZZ_INC/8402026345,1129000000.0,43.5,"Description
I think AZZ is a “B” business at a B+ cyclically-adjusted valuation with fundamentals that are about to ""stop getting worse."" While not a ""pound-the table"" endorsement, I thought it might be of value to some in the VIC community (it has never been written up on this forum). 
    Brief Business Description:  AZZ is country's largest non-captive galvanizer, a niche business that represents roughly 2/3rds of AZZ’s profits. The other 1/3rd of AZZ consists of a several small “electrical and industrial” businesses that primarily manufacture engineered products that help distribute electrical power between generators, transformers, and switching devices. The company has been profitable for ~30 consecutive years. 82% of revenue is derived from the United States (OUS is mostly Canada) and is headquartered in Fort Worth, TX.
  Investment thesis:
The galvanizing market has been sluggish (partially due to temporary hurricane impacts in TX) and zinc costs (which are passed through on a 30-90 day lag) have risen consistently & considerably over the past 12 months, depressing AZZ’s profitability. Over the next 24 months, I expect margins to revert back towards historical levels as (1) end markets improve (products that are galvanized are things like bridges, guardrails, cell towers, ladders, and boat trailers), (2) zinc costs subside (or are passed through), and (3) recent acquisitions are integrated. 
  The thesis can be boiled down into three pillars:
Consolidation = will industry-wide pricing stable, and perhaps improve competitive dynamics over time
Recent margin compression (due to rising zinc costs) is temporary
Favorable valuation & strong FCF
  The two major risks are:
Capacity growth could return to the galvanizing industry. Over the past several years, the # of galvanizing facilities in the US has remained constant ~140. 
Exposure to energy. While drilling related business only accounts for ~5% of AZZ’s revenue, AZZ’s galvanizing facilities index somewhat highly to states where the health of the energy business is key to industrial production. I believe the worst is behind us, as the ""petrochemical"" market declined from 14% of sales to 7% from FY16 to FY17. 
  I believe the 1YR risk/reward is favorable (~3:1). I expect AZZ to move higher with higher with >10% EPS growth ex deals (driven by end-market recovery + margin expansion via zinc cost pass through + self-help) coupled with upside from more tuck-in galvanizing deals. I believe the stock’s multiple is likely to expand from current levels as revenue and EPS growth re-accelerates after some acquisition indigestion and commodity issues.
  *Note, FY17 galvanizing margins include $7.3mn of realignment charges (~194bp headwind). Bear case essentially assumes no margin recovery from pro-forma FY17 levels. Additionally, electrical EBIT margins were 13% in FY17, excluding purchase accounting and the company has targeted 15% margins for this segment
  **DETAILS**
Investments Positives:
(+) The galvanizing segment provides a stable stream of income/FCF. This has helped the overall company generate $400mn in FCF over the past 5 years, equal to ~35% of the current market cap. 
Industry consolidation should lead to structurally stable/rising margins. As seen below, AZZ (~30% share) and VMI (~11% share) have both been buyers of galvanizing businesses over the past several years…The industry remains highly fragmented with ~50 single facility mom and pop players (140 facilities nationally).
Low value/weight = local pricing power. Similar to the aggregates industry (VMC), the amount of freight costs is relatively high vs. the value of the product being shipped. Therefore, galvanizing plants have significant pricing power for projects/customers in their immediate radius (it is hard for competitors 500+ miles away to undercut them on price).
  (+) Management has been dramatically upgraded over the past few years and has improved incentives across the organization. AZZ’s CEO Tom Ferguson spent 25 years with Flowserve where he oversaw $3bn in sales and 11,000 employees across 56 countries. He recruited several of his former colleagues to join him at AZZ. While Mr. Ferguson was President of Flow solutions (~36% of FLS’s EPS & the fastest growing segment during this tenure), Flowserve was a great stock, outperforming the S&P by >400%. FLS is regarded as a very well-run company. In a recent AZZ conference call, “We have converted our profit-sharing program to a performance-based bonus program. This program is designed predominantly around operating income cash flow, return on assets and productivity. To help drive results, every employee is now a participant in the incentive program. We have also extended equity-based compensation deeper into our management ranks.” 
  (+) Strong FCF profile and solid valuation. Over the past 6 years, FCF has been ~19% higher than net income. While AZZ trades at 25x consensus FY18 EPS, it only trades at 11.7x the average FCF generated in ‘15 & ‘16.
  Investment Negatives:
(-) Galvanizing is a competitive industry. If margins/returns get pushed too high, new supply is likely to come online. As seen in this Youtube video, there isn’t a ton of IP or value-add in this process. AZZ also faces competition from captive galvanizing facilities and alternative forms of corrosion protection (like paint).
  (-) There has been some modest capacity growth, which has impacted pricing in the gulf. While opening a new galvanizing plant from scratch is a difficult venture (low initial utilization vs. high initial cost of plant/chemicals), two new plants have recently opened in the United States in areas overlapping with AZZ plants. Metalplate announced a $10mn investment for a plant in Jennings Louisiana, and V&S recently opened a plant in Memphis.
  (-) Vulnerable to rising zinc costs (at least within 30-90 windows). Per KC Capital, “zinc is a key cost (30-40%) in the galvanizing process. Zinc prices have been relatively benign during the past two years, averaging about $1.00 per pound. However, zinc prices did rise sharply from about $0.60 per pound to over $2.00 per pound during 2006-2007.” During 2017, zinc costs have gone on a historic rise, as illustrated below. 
  (-) There is some cyclicality to the business. AZZ’s end markets generally follow the health of industrial production, which has slowed slightly of late. However, I feel as though we aren’t even in the sweet spot of the cycle. New power generation projects (a significant end market for AZZ), could remain depressed (though increased nuclear & coal/gas switching is a positive).  
  Business Details:
What is galvanizing? Hot dip galvanizing is a metallurgical process in which molten zinc is applied to steel. The zinc alloying renders corrosion protection to fabricated steel for extended periods of up to 50 years. Galvanizing is used in a wide variety of industrial applications where corrosion protection of steel is desired, including electrical and telecommunications, bridges and highway, petrochemical, and general industrial markets. Thus, demand for galvanizing services generally follows the industrial U.S. economy.
  As described in an initiation from Kansas City Capital, “Galvanizing companies are very much indistinguishable from each other except for kettle sizes. (A large kettle may allow some firms to galvanize very large fabricated products that others simply cannot.) Pricing discipline within this industry has been relatively good and operating margins across the cycle have generally reflected that discipline. The absence of any new galvanizing facilities and the consolidation efforts of AZZ and VMI have likely had a role in keeping margins relatively stable.”

I and/or others I advise do not hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

CafePress represents a unique opportunity to participate in a revenue growth story with sector tailwinds and embedded margin and multiple expansion potential, at an inexpensive valuation.
In summary, on topline PRSS benefits from double-digit growth in retail-wide e-commerce sales, plus additional growth from the trend toward personalization. On margins PRSS should benefit from a consolidation of six manufacturing locations to a single optimally-located, lower cost facility in Kentucky that will be completed later this year. And on valuation multiples, PRSS has been in the penalty box for significant misses on guidance in its first couple quarters after its IPO last year. These multiples should rebound once the company puts together a string of solid quarters and proves it can deliver on the growth and margin story it has pitched since the IPO. If the company executes on its sizable opportunity, we believe the stock price could more than double in the next 18 months.
About the company:
PRSS is a Sequoia-backed company (they are still the largest shareholder at 17%) that provides customized consumer products, most commonly thought of as t-shirts, mugs, buttons, etc., but actually spanning over 600 kinds of base goods. While they started out as a user-generated, “create and buy” site, they have evolved into a platform that allows individual designers, small shops, and large corporate brands to offer their own custom products, resulting in a marketplace of over 2 million shops, and millions of crowd-sourced designs for consumers and organizations to “find and buy” as well as create and buy. CafePress’ goal is to be the customization engine for e-commerce wherever it occurs, and describe their core competency as building high-quality, customized product efficiently, in very small order sizes (average order size is ~$50).
Why is it down so much?
PRSS’ stock price is down 65% since it IPOed at the end of March, 2012, and its next-year forward multiples have dropped dramatically as well (see table below). The main reason for the significant price decline and multiple compression is the fact that the company, in its first and second quarters immediately following the IPO, slashed forward guidance (8% on revenues, and 39% on ebitda). The reason they cut their guidance was primarily because of search algorithm changes at Google, which hurt revenue at small shops which depend on keyword traffic, but also from declines in political and international revenues. While the change in search algorithms was not something they could have predicted, the other two declines, especially coming in guidance less than 3 months after their IPO, seems like something they should have seen coming. This failure so near to their IPO did major damage to management credibility. While the last two quarters’ (Q4 2012 and Q1 2013) results have been more positive, with the company surpassing the high end of guidance, they have not yet regained investor confidence, especially because they continue to be in a manufacturing consolidation and acquisition integration process, and don’t expect normal margins to resume until the end of this year. The street appears to be waiting to see whether the company can actually deliver consistently on their targets. Below is a table comparing the company’s post IPO multiple with current levels, and with e-commerce industry multiples. For the industry multiple I used a comp set that has essentially the same revenue growth rate of 24%. (For the full comp table see farther below).
    fwd multiples
  PRSS post-IPO PRSS current e-commerce average
        next year p/s 1.1x .4x 1.7x
next year p/e 19.3x 14.0x 29.6x
next year ev/ebitda 8.1x 4.1x 14.5x
  While future search algorithm changes will continue to be a risk to the company, exposure has declined over the past year, as the percentage of revenue from the small shops that are most affected by algorithm changes has significantly decreased. The overall shops segment makes up less than 15% of total revenues, and the small shops portion has been getting smaller, while the corporate branded shops portion has been growing at 50+%.
Sector tailwinds:
National e-commerce sales have been growing at around 15% a year, much higher than the overall retail growth rate of around 5%. Projections for the next 5 year CAGR for e-commerce range from 10 to 15%*. Meanwhile, the primary product category that PRSS sells into (apparel and accessories) has the highest sub-category growth projections at ~17%. According to second-hand conversations with the current board member from Sequoia, Sequoia’s thesis when they invested in 2005 was that CafePress was a macro play on the growth in e-commerce, and that layering personalization on top of e-commerce results in an even more attractive growth-rate opportunity. That opportunity still appears valid, and is supported by the company’s long-term growth rate target of 20%.
*a comparison of 6 different projections, as well as sub-category projections can be found at http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Retail-Ecommerce-Set-Keep-Strong-Pace-Through-2017/1009836
Competitive advantage?:
Determining if the company can have a competitive advantage is important in a category which has no real technical barrier to entry in the actual production of customized t-shirts, coffee mugs, buttons, canvas paintings, etc. The company believes their evolution into a platform that focuses on quality and efficiency is their source of competitive advantage, for several reasons. As a platform they benefit from having a very large community of sellers and a long-tail of unique find-and-buy products. This broad reach creates network effects and a pool of demand for both CafePress and independent sellers on their platform, and an important advantage to scale for the company. For example, CafePress has over 500k followers on Facebook, and over 8,000 people currently talking about CafePress, versus their nearest-sized competitor, Zazzle, which has 79k followers, and some 600 people talking about it. Unlike for some vendors, this social presence actually drives real revenue for CafePress (revenues from social media channels were up 122% yoy in the most recent quarter). Clearly there is a virtuous circle here where the more people talk about, buy, and sell on CafePress, the more others will as well, so it’s up to the company to leverage the lead they currently have as the #1 consumer product customization company.
Additionally, CafePress has benefited from a focus on quality, which differentiates them from many other customized product vendors, which sell products that are often used just once and tossed aside (for example, a corporate event t-shirt). The CEO and CFO told us they believe their focus on building high-quality product has enabled them to win major corporate partners (such as ESPN, ABC, Paramount, Marvel, and Michael’s), which have their own shops on the platform, and represent one of the fastest growing segments of the business.
Finally, while it’s not hard from a technical perspective to build customized consumer products, building millions of them, most of them as a unit order of one, at low cost, is difficult, and while we don’t know the financials of their smaller private competitors, can reasonably conclude that CafePress’ size and soon-to-be centralized manufacturing location in Kentucky (where they have low cost of labor, tax incentives, and are co-located with UPS) provides them an opportunity for better margins than smaller competitors. Their largest competitor Zazzle builds some products in San Jose and outsources others. CafePress believes that of the products built in San Jose they clearly have a production cost advantage with their operations in Kentucky, and have higher quality than the outsourced products.
Margin and multiple expansion potential:
The company is currently consolidating six scattered manufacturing locations into one facility in Kentucky, and is investing about $6 mm of ebitda to complete this during the fourth quarter of this year. They expect a margin rebound after Q4 when this is complete, due to lower shipping and labor costs. Pre-IPO they said their long-term targets were 20% annual growth rates and mid-to-high teens ebitda margins. Despite the disappointments of last year, they still stand by these targets, and on the Q4 earnings call, they said they believe they can return to double-digit margins next year, as a result of the manufacturing consolidation. We asked the CEO and CFO why they haven’t reached their long-term margin targets in recent years (they claim they did in 2009, presumably on an adjusted basis), and they said that they have been investing for growth for the last several years. We think they will continue to have to invest in growth and will likely face pricing pressure, so we take the mid-to-high teens margin target with a grain of salt, but there is clear room for expansion from current levels of around 5% (on guidance this year, excluding the $6 mm consolidation expense, they would reach 7.7% ebitda margin), back toward historic, unadjusted levels near 10%.
As discussed above, because of the major guidance revisions immediately post IPO, trading multiples have significantly compressed. Should the company put together another couple quarters of meeting guidance, as they have begun to do with the last two, we believe investors will accord them a higher multiple. Based on e-commerce comparables and the company’s own multiples before it began slashing guidance, there is considerable room for expansion for a company growing at their rate.

  Target price:
For our target price we assume the company reaches guidance on revenues of $255 mm this year, and grows in the low teens in 2014 resulting in ~$288 mm of revenues. On margins we assume that they get back the $6 mm (2.4% of revenues) they are spending on consolidation this year, and benefit by another couple million from higher efficiencies next year, resulting in $24 mm of ebitda or an 8.4% ebitda margin, significantly more conservative than their projection of double-digit margins next year. Applying a 10x 2014 ebitda multiple (comps are 14.5x), and assuming only moderate cash generation of $10 mm, results in a target price of $16.05, and upside of 140%. The fact that our revenue growth and margin assumptions are more conservative than management’s, and our target multiple is well below industry comps shows how much this name has been punished, and how little trust is currently being placed in the company—and how much upside there may be should they execute.
Risks
Management execution. While the CEO and CFO talk as though they have learned lessons from the guidance disappointments of last year, and their business is diversified away from and has less exposure to the same issues, management still comes across as promotional on calls, leaving us with less confidence.
Competition. Even though Zazzle appears to be smaller and generating less online buzz, and likely has higher costs of production, their online merchandising appears very good—see their website. If they out-execute, they could cut CafePress’ growth. Additionally, high-end custom product marketplaces like Etsy could move downstream and cut into wallet/mind-share for CafePress. Or Amazon could decide to enter this space. Clearly Amazon’s distribution network and technology expertise would make it a strong competitor, though it does seem that certain processes and know-how that CafePress has developed over the years in building small orders efficiently would take cost and effort to replicate. Additionally, Amazon is a big sales partner of CafePress, listing and selling a lot of CafePress merchandise. At these prices, it probably would make more sense to acquire CafePress than to build it.
Cost of customer acquisition. Due to a variety of issues, such as further search algorithm changes, market saturation, etc., customer acquisition costs may go up significantly, preventing CafePress from reaching its promised margins.
Market trends/popularity for customization. Growth could be limited by changes in the popularity of customization or the manner in which it is delivered (like 3-D printers).
Major disposition by VC’s. According to second-hand conversations with Sequoia’s board member, a sale for them at these price levels seems unlikely, but could become more likely if the stock returns to double-digit levels.

    Investment Summary
Express Scripts is the leading Pharmaceutical Benefits Manager (PBM) in the U.S. after recently merging with one of its few major competitors, Medco. Express’ primary business is to negotiate with drug stores and pharmaceutical companies on behalf of its corporate or insurance clients in order to lower the cost of drugs and improve clinical outcomes. The company is run by a savvy management team led by CEO George Paz, who has been CEO since 2005. At 13x 2014E P/E, the stock is significantly undervalued given the quality of the business, likely strong EPS growth and excellent management team. We believe an investment in Express’ stock will generate compelling annual returns over a 5 year period with minimal risk of capital loss.
  The Business
Express sells prescription drugs and management services to insurance companies and health plan sponsors (employers) through 3+ year contracts, leveraging scale to negotiate lower drug costs from retailers as well as branded and generic suppliers. Express and other PBMs take a cut of the cost savings – the spread between the price to health plans and the cost from the manufacturer or the reimbursement from retail pharmacies. There are essentially two routes for drugs to flow through the supply chain and arrive in patients’ hands: through a retail pharmacy or through a mail-order pharmacy run by a PBM. Admittedly over-simplified versions of the two routes are below:
  Retail Channel: 
Drug Manufacturer --> Retail Pharmacy --> PBM --> Payer --> Patient
  Mail Channel:
Drug Manufacturer --> PBM Mail Pharmacy --> Payer --> Patient
  PBMs are also paid an administrative fee per script. Note that client RFP processes are typically consultant driven.  Importantly, while Express is more advanced in its service offerings than its competitors, the business is largely a commoditized one, and therefore Express’ economies of scale are an important differentiator.  That said, Express is keenly focused on “consumerology,” using behavioral analysis to determine how to best motivate patients to opt for the most cost effective form of drug delivery as well as improve adherence (i.e. taking their medications). 
  A PBM helps solve the continual need for health plan clients: containing drug costs.  The main drivers of reducing drug costs for clients are buying power as well as shifting to generics.  Moving willing clients’ customers to receive prescription drugs through mail delivery also lowers costs by cutting out the retail pharmacy. Note that PBMs are on the right side of the health care issues in the country by helping contain runaway costs.  Since the private sector is largely left with the burden of controlling costs, we believe that there could be not only continued relevance of PBMs but also a greater role in other areas of healthcare.
  Express is a great business that enjoys high returns on capital.  Before its merger with Medco, Express earned a 17% ROIC even after building up intangibles with multiple acquisitions over time, and a 40% ROE.  Client retention is ~95% annually. The company has multi-year, staggered contracts with its clients, retailers, and drug manufacturers.   
  It is important to note that Express generates a significant portion of its gross margin and profits from generics (where it has more bargaining power with multiple suppliers than with branded drug makers) and through its mail business (where it can cut out the retailer). 
  Competitive Position
Express is the clear leader in a virtual duopoly with CVS/Caremark.  Express currently owns 34% of the $280 billion U.S. PBM market.  Caremark has 26%.  Several smaller players have less market share:  Optum (a division of UnitedHealth) has 12% which is 80% or more United business, Catamaran has 5%, and Prime has 5%. Contrary to industry hearsay, we believe large players will continue to act rationally on price, as oligopolists should. 
  Express’ most significant competitive advantage is scale. Negotiating leverage from scale over retailers and drug manufacturers drives sustainable cost advantages, and cost to the client is the most important factor in retaining and winning business. Importantly, Express has not yet fully leveraged its improved market power from merging with Medco, which we view as a good opportunity to drive higher gross margins over the coming years. Express’ scale also provides access to more data than any other PBM has, driving superior analytics that allows Express to best optimize drug selections as well as influence patient behavior.
  It is worth noting that Express has specialized in the push to generics and emphasizing of behavioral outcomes while Medco has been more focused on the shift to mail and on therapeutic optimization. The merger was good in more ways than simply economies of scale as optimizing both mail and generic penetration for the combined company should drive higher earnings.
  The recent Express/Walgreens dispute illustrated Express’ strong competitive position. In June 2011, Walgreens (the largest retail pharmacy in the U.S.) would not agree to the pricing demands Express required to keep processing prescriptions with them. In a high stakes game of chicken, Express did not back down and pulled their customers from being able to buy drugs at Walgreens stores. Shortly after the Express/Walgreens contract was terminated, Express made a bid for Medco (Walgreens only real PBM alternative to Express) as Medco’s stock price was particularly weak. Express then steered its scripts away from Walgreens for nine months, at which point Walgreens realized the game was up and was forced to crawl back to Express at less advantageous terms. This situation shows the dramatic power Express has in the industry and will likely deter other, smaller retailers from balking at Express’ pricing.
  Industry
PBMs play a key role in the prescription drug value chain. Effectively, a PBM consolidates millions of patients’ demand for scripts in order to drive a volume-based price discount when purchasing drugs. PBMs’ bargaining power varies greatly depending on whether the drug is branded (one supplier) or generic (multiple, commoditized suppliers). When 5 or more generic suppliers are competing for a large volume contract with a PBM, the PBM has enormous bargaining power. Even amongst generics, the gross margins on a particular drug can range from ~15% to over 50% depending on the number of manufacturers.
  There are a number of tailwinds for the PBM industry.  Drug utilization rises over time, although it has been flat more recently because of the poor economy (fewer employed lives covered and less disposable income for drugs). Specialty drugs, i.e. large molecule biotech drugs, are expected to grow 10% over the next five years, and Express has a disproportionate 40% share of the non-medical specialty market. Also, branded drug price inflation of 5-8% over time is a positive factor.  The population is aging, and people tend to take more pills as they age. Lastly, there will be 30-40 million new insured people from Obamacare, although the profitability of these new covered lives is not yet clear.
  Generic and mail penetration over time has significantly improved PBMs’ profitability. Generic penetration industry-wide has increased from 40% of scripts in 2002 to 77% in 2012. Given upcoming patent expirations, 2017 generic penetration is expected to be roughly 85%. 
  Industry-wide mail penetration is 18% of scripts. (Express’ mail penetration is 28%.) There is room for increased penetration since 74-85% of scripts are chronic/maintenance. Movement to mail has been slow, partly as older people take a disproportionate amount of drugs and are slower to move to mail. Mail is superior to retail in driving down costs not only because it cuts out the physical retailer but also because it leads to better clinical outcomes through better adherence and compliance.  Mail is also safer since there are fewer fill errors than at retail pharmacies.
  Management
The management team, led by CEO George Paz, is excellent with respect to operations, strategy and capital allocation. Paz joined the company as CFO in 1998, became President in 2003, and CEO in 2005.  Since joining, Paz and the management team have created tremendous value for shareholders: the stock price has risen 24% annualized since 1998 and 23% since 2003.  Paz owns ~$138 mm of stock. The company has a record of smart and successful acquisitions, Medco being the last.  Management believes that the pure PBM model is superior to that of a blend of both PBM and retail, such as CVS/Caremark, a view with which we agree. Paz has also proven very strategically savvy as the Walgreens dispute illustrates.
  Management is focused on the right metrics: cash flow per share, ROIC, and growing EPS over the long-term.  Long-term compensation is based on total stock return, EPS growth, and ROIC.  The company has been a longtime user of both debt and share repurchases to enhance shareholder value.
  Also, while the company has indicated that its Medco merger synergy goal is $1 billion, we believe the number could be substantially greater than this, especially when the market power of the combined company is exercised.
    Price
Express currently trades at 13x 2014E P/E, which we believe is a significant discount to intrinsic value. (We believe 2014 is the best indicator of the price as 2013 has a number of one-off puts and takes in earnings, e.g. merging Medco and running-off the legacy Medco UnitedHealth contract.)
  The current price does not reflect Express’ strong position in a near-duopoly with good growth prospects from increased generic penetration, drug price inflation, increased insureds from Obamacare, an aging population and higher mail penetration. Improvements in employment and expansion into adjacent areas of healthcare may also prove to be quite beneficial to Express’ earnings power over the next 5 years. Furthermore, the current valuation does not factor in the company’s high quality management team who will likely deploy capital in value-accretive ways over the next 5 years. Note that 13x P/E is near the lowest trading multiple Express has had over its long history and provides a great entry point for an excellent business. Over a 5 year time horizon, we believe Express’ stock represents an excellent risk/reward.
  Because of near-term issues including contract renewal pricing, the economy’s impact on script volumes, the Medco merger, the loss of UnitedHealth and the impact from Obamacare, modeling Express’ EPS with great specificity over the next several quarters or the next year is quite difficult. This uncertainty around near-term EPS has led to the stock’s low multiple. While we agree that volumes may be weak due to high unemployment, there is also concern amongst analysts and investors that pricing in the industry is weakening, which we do not believe is correct. The near-term uncertainty is creating opportunity for attractive long-term returns.
  Risks
U.S. shifts to single-payer healthcare system. This seems very unlikely given the recent huge battle just to get to Obamacare.  Similarly, if the federal government were to decree lower prices for drugs, this could reduce the PBM’s value in reducing drug costs.
  Two large customer contracts that represent ~21% of revenues. The Wellpoint contract, which expires in 2019, was 25% of Express’ revenues before the Medco merger. (We estimate that percentage is now ~13% of the combined company.) The Department of Defense contract is ~10% of the combined company’s revenues and expires in October 2014. The next largest client is ~3% of total revenues.
  Increased regulation and potential litigation surrounding pricing and rebates. Although nothing is currently on the horizon, there is potential for regulatory involvement in the practices of the industry (such as the relative opacity with which contracts allocate pricing and costs). 
  Independent PBM model loses favor amongst clients. While there are advantages to being an independent PBM, we have to consider the possible complications of not being aligned with a retail chain (such as Caremark with CVS) or an insurer (such as Optum with UnitedHealth).

Since 2000, Section 16 insiders have received cash compensation over $20mm and have net sold $5mm of stock, shareholders have been diluted 7-X and accumulated losses of $180mm.

We believe OMEX stock is worth Zero and if OMEX is unable to raise equity they will be forced to file bankruptcy within the next 6-12 months.
In spite of the recent Gairsoppa success, OMEX’s business lines of historical shipwrecks and commodity shipwrecks have averaged $20mm of annual losses over the past 5 years and we believe are unlikely to repay OMEX’s growing debt burden.
The CEO has publicly stated they do not have enough cash to operate through the end of 2014 and carries their debt at a discount to face value on their SEC financials.
As highlighted by the “Black Swan” debacle, we believe UNESCO’s new regulations to protect national gravesites and heritage make for-profit historic shipwreck hunting unviable.
We believe OMEX’s new business of undersea mineral exploration is a pipedream and worth zero. 
We believe that management representations of “$179mm of Off Balance Sheet Value” in equity stakes are inflated by at least a factor of 10 and we question whether they are based on non-arm’s length transactions.
In early 2013, OMEX created a new business “Oceanica” that utilizes opaque offshore subsidiaries in Panama and Bahamas that we question how there could be any valid business purpose and are reminiscent of Enron’s use of off balance sheet entities to obfuscate the true nature of cash transfers and inflate valuations.
We believe that Neptune Minerals, Inc. – founded by John Morris, co-founder and former CEO of OMEX – is also worthless and is simply a reincarnation of Neptune Minerals, Plc, a failed public company in the UK which John Morris acquired for $140,000 in 2011.
According to an attachment to OMEX’s recent 10Q, via Oceanica, OMEX is partners with a Panamanian company, DNA Ltd Inc.

Vonovia is the largest German residential REIT although the term REIT is a misnomer as there are no tax advantages unlike in US. Vonovia owns apartments all over Germany and is very diversified. It also purchased a residential property company in Sweden a few years ago which is a minor part of the portfolio.
Germany is a rent-control market. Rents are only allowed to grow at a certain rate per year. You can see below the very steady (and LOW!) rent growth in Germany regardless of market cycles. In the current recession/crash, rent growth will continue at a similar. This is very different from US where rent growth can collapse in a recession, and varies widely but also is much higher overall in bull cycles. 
All these years of rent growth suppression has meant that Germans are paying a lot less in rent than most other rich European countries.
This has meant that Germany is largely a rent market and not a home ownership market like US, UK or Australia etc. 
BUT a consequence of the years of rent growth suppression is that rent growth has not kept pace in building materials inflation growth. The yields and cap-rate on the properties are linked to German Bund yields. And since the Rents are locked, that has meant that NAVs are in effect driven by the low rent growth and any cap-rate compression. And this has lagged building materials growth so the replacement value is much higher as new building costs are much higher than existing portfolios. 
This has meant that newbuilding activity has dried up as a new costly building will generate sub-par returns as the rent generated on it would have to be compete with existing properties where rent is suppressed. This has meant that there is a robust market in refurbishment and upgrades. The reason is that the local authorities allow one-off 20-30% rent increase if a developer can demonstrate sufficient modernization. Vonovia has taken advantage of this to consistently modernize 5-10% of its portfolio per year for a 20-30% rent bump to translate into a 1.5-2.5% revenue increase. In addition to the regular 1.5% allowed rent increase, it has translated to steady 4% rent increases. 
  Vonovia has innovated and has a plan of modular construction techniques at scale to build down construction costs that small/medium builders/owner cannot compete with as Vonovia is doing this modular construction at scale. In addition it continues to have a robust programme of modernizing its entire buildings as well as the individual apartments in those buildings whenever they open up / become available (from someone moving or dying etc). See below for the upcoming and explanding capex programme.
The lack of investment in newbuildings in general, plus cap-rate compression and a seach of real assets has all led to a surge in property prices and NAVs recently.  Although this price boom has been limited to Tier A cities. The country at large is slowly catching up and Vonovia (with a broad portfolio) will benefit.
By sweating its existing assets harder via modernization has meant that Vonovia's margins are slowly expanding. 
All this has resulted in steady cash flow, divs, and NAV per share growth.
  I think Vonovia remains a fantastic long-term investment. Stock is trading at 19x P/E for next year, but I believe this is a high quality investment. Vonovia should easily grow earnings at high single digits for a decade sustainably by translating that 4-5% revenue growth with some financial and operational gearing into a 8-9% earnings growth. Coupled with a 3% div yield, you are looking at 11-12% total return which is decent for a 19x P/E stock with a lot of uncertainty in other areas. If NAVs appreciate closer to replacement (and prices for their properties are generally higher than their booked NAVs) then it's added bonus.

  Situation overview:
  Following a mid-December 2020 spin-off of the majority of its stabilized assets into AIRC, AIV is an orphaned REIT stock comprised of a combination of stabilized multifamily assets, mezzanine debt and a sizeable development pipeline.  Despite a nearly $1B market cap and trading over $15M per day, it is a single-digit stock with no dividend, no sellside coverage and a management team that has essentially gone dark other than its earnings release and 10-K release several weeks ago.  Coincidentally, the founder and long-time CEO made his largest open market purchase in the company’s 10 year history of being public a couple weeks ago, at a price just 8% below where the shares are currently trading.  I believe this is a highly asymmetric situation with 70% return in my base case and a chance to make 150%+ over the course of a year, and with fairly limited downside.  
NAV summary:
Despite being a development company, the bulk of the current value are actually in the stabilized multifamily portfolio.  This is comprised of 24 multifamily assets spread across the country.  The assets are mostly A- and B+ assets with 65% suburban / 35% urban mix by book value.  The portfolio was acquired mostly in the late 1990’s and early 2000’s, and has an undepreciated book value of $1,071M, and it produced $87M of NOI in 2020.  I reviewed each of the properties and evaluated their quality and occupancy levels and was pleasantly impressed.  The current acquisition market for multifamily assets is very strong, with cap rates at record lows and tight inventory.  In addition public multifamily REITs are trading in the mid 4% cap rate range.  Applying a 5% cap rate to 2020 NOI for the AIV portfolio, which is depressed due the pandemic, implies $1.7B of value for the multifamily portfolio alone, which is below the current enterprise value of $1.6B.  
In addition to this multifamily portfolio, we also get:
A $307 mezzanine loan yielding 10% to a lower income multifamily development project in San Francisco
A recent acquisition of “Hamilton on the Bay,” a multifamily building in Biscayne Bay, Miami: https://www.hamiltononthebaymiami.com/
A recent acquisition of 1001 Brickell Bay Drive (https://www.1001brickellbay.com/), a prime located office building in downtown Miami which also is adjacent to one of AIV’s multifamily buildings.  The company hasn’t yet released its long term development  plans but there is extra acreage and likely ability to create value through assemblage (https://www.globest.com/2019/10/24/apartment-reit-aimco-buys-1001-brickell-bay-office-tower-for-157-million-296-211134/)
A development pipeline of 4 assets currently leased from AIRC, and where AIV will be paid by AIRC for nearly all of the value creation upon completion
Several other JVs and other assets detailed in the table below
  On the liability side, there is $457M of non-recourse property level debt and a $534M note to AIRC.  There is also a $131M deferred tax liability associated with the 1001 Brickell purchase.  
As you can see in the table below, my NAV ranges from $7.70 in the downside case, where I apply a 6% cap rate to the multifamily assets (125 to 150bps wide of where this portfolio would likely transact in the private market) and give essentially no credit for the development pipeline.  In this downside case I assume a 25% trading discount to NAV and still get $5.75 per AIV share, which is only 8% below the current share price.  In my base and upside cases, I achieve $11.99 and $17.43 per share of value, which is 92% and 179% above the current share price.
Catalysts:
I think this situation has remained off of the radar of most investors, as all of the sellside dropped AIV coverage and switched to AIRC.  In addition, the company won’t speak with investors directly, and has only published a 10-K and earnings report.
The founder and Chairman Terry Considine made his largest purchase ever open market purchase in AIV stock several weeks ago, acquiring ~$3M shares in the $5.80 range.  The company hasn’t yet released its incentive plan, but I believe they are largely aligned with shareholders to create value.
As the company begins to report more results and proves out its development pipeline, I expect the large gap between NAV and share price to narrow significantly.
A word on multifamily macro:
While single family housing strength garners much of the attention in the market, multifamily demand remained resilient through the pandemic, outside of major coastal gateway cities (New York and San Francisco, and to a lesser extent Boston and Seattle).  Suburban and sunbelt / mountain west rents remained very strong.  Coastal rents bottomed at the end of last year.  I don’t have a strong view on the macro from here, but the public markets believe in the recovery, with coastal multifamily REITs EQR and AVB having rallied to within 15% of their pre-pandemic highs, and trading in the 4% to 4.5% implied cap rate range.  MAA with greater sunbelt / suburban exposure continues to make new highs.  While I am generally constructive on multifamily trends, hedging this risk is simple.

Investment Thesis:
The SRL stub is a long because you can create a stub (by buying SRL AU and shorting out it's holding in SAR SP)
that costs 0.28c (this flucuates....prices of as of a few days ago when I typed this up, as I'm about to submit this the cost of the stub is -0.15c), but is worth more than $3.
  Business description:
The SRL stub represents all SRL business ex-its 51% ownership of SAR.  The core business includes the Whim Creek and Tritton Copper Operations in Australia, the Mt Muro Gold Mine in Indonesia, a recently acquired coal mine in Madagascar and a portfolio of mining investments, development projects and exploration ground throughout Australia and Indonesia.  The stub is created by shorting ~2.417 shares of SAR for every share owned of SRL.

    SAR’s Sebuku Coal Mine:
-          SAR, listed in Singapore, owns and operates the Sebuku Coal Mine in Indonesia with expected annual production in 2008 of over 4Mtpa
-          Recently acquired the Jembayan mine in East Kalimantan for $350MM, which doubles SAR’s production in 2008 to a combined 8+Mtpa (Jembayan has a resource base of 40Mt which could more than double as only 40% has been explored)
-          Also acquired the Northern Concession directly to the north of Sebuku for $25MM – this has 4Mtpa available for mining immediately with a resource base that could be in excess of 85Mt

  Varomet (NPV ~$50MM)
-          Has 2 main businesses:
o        Supplies Ferro alloy and aluminum to car manufacturers - a smaller piece with higher margins (~10-15%)
o        Trades copper cathodes – larger piece but only has 1% margins
-          Currently trying to deconsolidate this piece and expects to get around $50MM for it (note that ideally management would like to maintain a 30% interest to be close to their end markets)
Note: ~$430MM of debt on SRL’s balance sheet is non-recourse debt from Varomet, which we’ve excluded from the company’s total debt
  Exploration (NPV ~$30MM)
-          Should be able to get $30MM net of all costs incurred till date if they were to sell these assets today
  Madagascar Coal Mine (NPV ~$150MM)
-          In January 2008 SRL announced that it was purchasing an initial 35% interest in a private company, Red Island Minerals (RIM), which owns an 80% interest in a coal mine in Madagascar for $45MM
-          While it is still early management expects to be able to produce 3-5Mtpa in the next 2-3 years and believes that this could get as high as 6-10Mtpa in a couple of years

  Investment Merits:
  ·         The stub is exceptionally discounted: For ~$160MM investors are getting assets with an NAV of ~$900MM. In addition, upon comparing the stub assets to some publicly traded firms it is evident that they trade at a significant discount (see following table comparing FCX with Tritton and Whim Creek).

  Scheid Vineyards trades at a 67%+ discount to my Net Asset Value (NAV) calculation of over
$200 per share. How is it possible to buy a company at such a significant discount to NAV?
Mainly, because few people know that Scheid Vineyards exists. Eleven years ago, the company
went “dark” and stopped filing financials with the SEC and the stock has been languishing in
obscurity ever since. In addition, the company trades only about 500 shares a day. In many
ways, Scheid is practically a private company. However, there aren’t many private companies
you can buy into for such enormous discounts to a reasonable valuation.
  Scheid is actually starting to come out of the dark and just started releasing quarterly and
annual numbers to investors for the first time in almost a dozen years. As more information
comes out, more investors will discover just how undervalued Scheid actually is. My estimate of
liquidation value is somewhere between $198 and $241 per share.
  Scheid Has Been Growing Grapes for 45 Years and Making Wine for Over a Dozen Years
  The origins of Scheid Vineyards can be found not in the love of winemaking, but in tax law. In
1972, Al Scheid, a self-employed investment banker, founded Monterey Farming Corp. to plant
vineyards and generate tax losses for a group of wealthy investors. At that time losses
generated by development of vineyards were legally deductible from all sources of income.
  Over the years, what was once a tax loss play has blossomed into a company with substantial
land and vineyard assets in Monterey County, California. By the mid-1990s, Al had bought out
the last of his limited partners and took the company public as Scheid Vineyards Inc. The
proceeds were used to develop additional vineyards in Monterey.
  By about 2002, the market for small cap stocks had all but disappeared. Scheid used internally
generated cash to buy in shares, substantially reducing the capitalization. In 2006, frustrated by
the costs and regulations of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Scheid “went dark,” stopped filing
financials with SEC or issuing press releases and started trading over the counter (not on any
major stock exchange). Until recently, the company has operated in public market obscurity.
  Valuable Assets in Monterey County, California
  Monterey County, California is about as close to agricultural paradise as it gets. The area’s
moderate temperatures and reliable water for irrigation make it the perfect environment for
many crops. Few may realize that the Salinas Valley area of Monterey County is known as “the
  Salad Bowl of America.” The area produces 70% of the nation’s lettuce and is home to two of
the four largest orchid growers in the U.S. There are also 46,000 acres of wine grape vineyards
in the county. Monterey produces the most Chardonnay grapes of any county in the United
States and is also known for its excellent Pinot Noir wine grapes.
  Scheid Vineyards owns or leases the land of close to 4,000 gross acres of vineyards in Monterey
County and contract farms another 740 acres for one of the world’s largest wine producers. The
company also owns and operates a state of the art winery that covers nearly three acres. This
facility commenced operations with the harvest of 2005. The capacity has been increased
almost annually and most recently expanded in 2016. It processes over 30,000 tons of grapes
each harvest, which represents over 2 million cases of wine. The company also owns and
operates a small, boutique winery in which its best premium wines are produced. The company
has invested over $75 million developing these facilities.
  The company is completely vertically integrated. From growing the grapes, to crushing, to
fermentation, blending, and on to the bottling and shipping; Scheid does it all. It is important to
note that only a few mass market wine producers have similar control from the field to the
bottled product. This means Scheid can control quality and quickly react to take advantage of
opportunities in the retail wine markets.
  Scheid Has Been Growing Its Private Labels
  Despite its puny market cap, Scheid is not a tiny company, nor is it a slow growing one. The
company posted revenue of $62.3 million in fiscal 2017 (ended February), up 27% from the
previous year and up almost 50% from fiscal 2015. Cash flow (EBITDA) jumped 37% to almost
$15 million year over year. Net income was up 75% from prior year.
  Why? The company has transitioned from just selling grapes and bulk wine to other bottlers, to
creating its own brands and private label brands for retailers. Scheid has partnered with several
large retail chains to create wine labels that are exclusive to that retailer. For example, there
are brands that are exclusive to the largest grocery chain in the U.S.
  Another example is a partnership with the famous TV personality, Kathy Lee Gifford - called
GIFFT - which Kathy Lee promotes. And, if you are in first class on one of the largest airlines in
the world, you are likely drinking Scheid Vineyards wine made just for that airline - you just
wouldn’t realize it.
  Specifically, Scheid is producing the quality of a $20+ bottle and then delivering it into retail for
a $12-$16 price point. And it is proving to be very, very successful. This segment of the business
has grown from $8 million to $23 million in annual revenue in just two years. Scheid also
produces high quality wines that retail for up to $70 per bottle.
  Retailers are clearly loving the private label strategy, as it enables them to capture some of the
margin that they have been giving up to branded wine companies. The private label business
has become so important to grocers that Kroger is suing competitor Lidl for trademark
infringement, since the Lidl chain private label name sounds too close to Kroger’s “Private
Selection.” While it is easy to make private label deli meats, paper goods and other basic
commodity items, it is much more difficult to develop a private label wine. Scheid comes up
with the government approved label, wine type and marketing campaign for the retailer. Since
Scheid is in control, vineyard to bottle, they can guarantee quality, volume, price and reliable
delivery. The largest wine producers don’t compete for this business since they have their own
brands to produce and promote.
  The trend to private labels should not stop any time soon. What makes Scheid so compelling as
a partner is that there are very few vineyards that are vertically integrated and have the
capacity to provide new wines and labels. Scheid can process wine equal to 2 million cases, but
its own branded wines used up only 500,000 cases of that volume in 2016. The rest of the 2016
volume was sold as bulk wine to other wineries or went into private labels.
  So far in fiscal 2018 (calendar year ends in February), sales are down due to bulk wine sales.
They had excess inventory from past bumper crops that caused sales to fall for their first six
months of the year. The bulk wine segment will be choppy from year to year, but the focus for
Scheid is on the cased goods business.
  Worldwide Wine Production to Hit a 50-Year Low
  This is a great time to invest in the wine industry due to rather dramatic declines in global wine
production volumes to levels not seen in 50 years. Due to extreme weather in France, Italy and
Spain, worldwide production is estimated to fall 8% in 2017. France is facing its worst harvest
since 1945 with production volumes down 19%.
  Wine volumes in the U.S. are estimated to fall 1% and this is before the small effect from the
recent fires in Northern California. Wineries there had already harvested most of their grapes
when the fires hit.
  Over the next 12 to 24 months, wine prices should increase as the industry struggles to meet
demand because of such large decreases in this year’s production. This bodes very well for
Scheid over the next two years as the company grows its cased goods business. While the
impact may not be immediate, it provides a nice backdrop and tailwind for the company.
  Forward Cash Flow Valuation Potential
  I estimate that the company should be able to grow revenue in the next three years to $80
million in fiscal 2020, and $100 million by 2022. Obviously, these numbers are contingent on
continued growth in Scheid’s own labels and the private label business.
  Scheid is investing in staff and infrastructure to support continued growth. The company just
announced a new wind turbine which will power the winery compound and lower energy costs.
  (Watch the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnNzLKgS_fk&feature=youtu.be)
Other additions include the hiring of a purchasing manager, who will be responsible for driving
down the cost of materials and supplies. The company is also increasing distribution via an
aggressive social media sales program, staffed by new hires.
  For the next couple of years, it is definitely a guess as to what earnings will look like, as it will
depend on how aggressively the company invests into their operations. Scheid Vineyards is
plowing back their cash flow back into the company to build long term value.
  Assuming the company’s EBITDA margin stays in the range of 23-25%, by 2020, Scheid
Vineyards could produce cash flow of approximately of $21 million or $24 per share. That said,
the margins should be able to increase as the company scales, it all depends how much the
company invests in their infrastructure.
  Considering the current stock price of $67 per share and the market cap of $59 million, Scheid’s
valuation seems woefully underpriced.
  Scheid Stock Is Cheap
  Scheid’s book value is $46.5 million, or $52.70 per share based on 882,586 shares currently
outstanding. But the book value doesn’t even come close to telling the story of the value of the
company’s assets, due to land appreciation and depreciation accounting.
  The company owns the land underlying 1,892 acres of vineyards. Based on calls to a well-known
vineyard broker and appraiser in Monterey County, vineyards sell in the range of $40,000 to
$60,000 an acre. So, just on vineyards alone, Scheid has an asset value of $76 million to $114
million.
As a comparison, prices in the prized Santa Lucia Highlands area of Monterey County prices top
$75,000 an acre. Napa and Sonoma vineyards trade for $140,000 to $160,000 an acre.
Wineries, such as those in Napa and Sonoma, are legally permitted to blend in up to 15% of
wine or grapes produced in other districts and still label them as Napa and Sonoma wines. This
is one reason Scheid has a ready-made market for both grapes and bulk wine. There is even a
fascinating argument to make that Monterey County land is undervalued, since so many Napa
and Sonoma labels use Monterey County grapes in their wine.
  Scheid’s state of the art winery facility is also quite valuable. There is a strong case to make that
it is worth more than its $75 million construction cost, but to be conservative let us assume that
it is worth only the $75 million. That is roughly equal to its total debt.
  The company also owns 123 acres of non-vineyard farm land next to Greenfield, CA that is in
the process of being annexed and re-zoned for residential and commercial development. I value
this land, after annexation, at $150,000 an acre. This adds an additional $18.5 million in value.
        Now, if we just add the company’s land holdings and winery facility value, we get a gross
valuation of $169 million to $205 million.
  Scheid also owns the vineyards on 1,842 acres of long term leased land. According to Crimson
Wine Group (NASDAQ: CVGW), an investment of $25,000 to $75,000 in capital improvements is
necessary to get a vineyard into production. For purposes of Scheid’s valuation, I took a
conservative approach and assumed a vineyard value of $20,000 per acre. The 1,842 acres adds
about $37 million in value.
  Since wine is produced only one time per year, the company currently holds $49 million in
inventory at cost.
  The company has $80 million in debt with Rabobank. The two debt instruments have a blended
average 3.76% and 3.86% interest, reflecting the high quality of the company’s credit.
  Subtracting out the debt of $80 million, here are the range of valuations. Remember there are
882,586 shares outstanding. Even with its low liquidity, Scheid’s per share undervaluation is
extreme.
  Publicly Traded Comps
  Another valuation approach is to compare Scheid to other publicly traded wine companies.
There are three comparable companies I used: Crimson Wine Group (NASDAQ: CWGL),
Treasury Wine Estates (OTC: TSRYY), Willamette Valley Vineyards (NASDAQ: WVVI).
  Crimson Wine Group and Willamette Valley are probably the best comparables. Crimson owns
vineyards in Napa and Sonoma County and was a spin-off from Leucadia National (NYSE: LUK).
It is treated almost like a private company, trades an average of less than 8,000 shares a day
and is closely held. Willamette is an Oregon based vineyard that is also illiquid, trading only
7,000 to 8,000 shares a day.
  Treasury is an Australian based wine conglomerate that has a $9 billion market cap. It probably
is not the best comp, but I included it in my analysis because it shows what kind of multiple the
market gives companies that are growing and performing.
  The chart below shows that Scheid has about the same revenue as Crimson, 3 times the
revenue of Willamette, but the valuation is very different in every respect.
        The lowest comp, price to tangible book value, would put Scheid’s value at $127 per share.
  Family Control, but Strong Family Management
  To understand Scheid Vineyards, you must understand the founder and Chairman, Al Scheid.
His resume is impressive and I recommend reading his memoir, Breaking Out of Beerport. It is a
great read.Al is a born story teller and the book has garnered very favorable reviews.
  https://www.amazon.com/Breaking-Out-Beerport-Al-Scheid- ebook/dp/B00PIXH408/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1500061558&sr=1- 2&keywords=al+scheid
  You will learn that Al grew up in, and escaped from, a poor coal mining town in Ohio, put
himself through college working as a repo man, ranch hand and, finally, as a furniture salesman.
He then achieved an MBA from the Harvard Business School in 1959.
  Al went on to be an investment banker for E.F. Hutton. He then founded four successful
companies; his own investment banking firm, the wine grape farming company, and two
biotechnology research companies. He has been in the wine grape and wine business for 45
        years and was recently selected as the 2017 Leader of the Year by the California Association of
Winegrape Growers, the state-wide winegrower’s trade association.
  His son, Scott, (BA, Claremont McKenna College) joined the company in 1986, rose through the
ranks and is now CEO. Kurt Gollnick, (BS, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo) the COO, joined Scheid in
1988. Heidi Scheid (Al’s daughter), (MBA, U of Southern California) is Executive Vice President,
oversees sales and has been with the company since 1992. The last family member working for
the company is Tyler Scheid (Al’s son), (Masters Degree, Colorado State University) who is
Special Projects Manager.
  This is a family run company for sure, but it is an educated and experienced high functioning
one. The proof is in the results. The fact that the management team has been intact for such a
long time with no family drama is a definite plus for shareholders. They are long term focused,
well financed and plan their moves carefully.
  No Shortage of Potential Suitors
  Management is quite adamant that they have no plans to sell, but if they ever change their
minds there are many potential acquirers who would be interested in the company’s assets,
brands and capabilities. There are obviously large liquor and wine companies such as Treasury
Wine, but there are also fast growing private companies, such as Delicato Family Vineyards,
which is now the fourth largest wine company in America. See this recent article about its
acquisition spree:
  http://napavalleyregister.com/wine/delicato-s-growing-presence-in-the-wine-industry-- /article_77ef5d0e-086f-5834-8f9f-f732108ea6b4.html
  Institutions, including Harvard’s endowment, is also getting in on the action. Harvard has
purchased approximately 10,000 acres of central coast California vineyards. The key money
quote in the below article is the investor bemoaning the fact that there are no 1,000 acre
vineyards of any quality for sale, nor is there anyone with operational expertise as well. Scheid
has both.
  https://www.winesandvines.com/news/article/192724/Institutional-Investors-Making-Wine- Plays
  Beyond larger wine companies, there are many wealthy investors, Silicon Valley magnates or
hedge fund managers who would love to own a company like Scheid Vineyards. And Asian
investors are increasingly buyers of California vineyards. In 2014, a Chinese private equity firm
bought Quixote winery for $29 million. This winery produced only 6,000 to 8,000 cases a year.
There are several more purchases highlighted in the article below:
  http://www.winespectator.com/webfeature/show/id/50293
  As the company’s stature grows, the company will attract more and more interest.
  Risks
  The main risk to investing in Scheid is the stock’s lack of liquidity. The company’s shares trade
on average 500 shares a day and, some days, it doesn’t trade at all. In many ways, investing in
Scheid is like investing in a private company.
  Another risk is that management until recently had little care for the illiquidity or where the
stock traded. Their single-minded goal is to grow and build the business. There were few press
releases, no quarterly earnings, no investor calls or presentations.And remember, the company
doesn’t file financial information with the SEC. This means it is hard for anyone to find out or
analyze the company as an investment. However, this is changing as the company is starting to
send out quarterly and annual earnings with comments.
  The third risk is that this is a family controlled company and that there always is the potential of
self-dealing, family squabbles, nepotism and other potential risks. But to date, the company has
had none of these problems and the company is thriving under the Scheid family’s leadership.
  On the plus side, as of this writing, there are three outside directors and the company has four
regularly scheduled board of director meetings each year and has done this for over twenty
years. Also, the company has undergone complete audits from an independent auditing firm
(currently, Moss-Adams, LLP, a top 15 accounting firm) for over 25 years, without an adverse
opinion. So, the company treats itself as though it were a widely held, SEC reporting entity.
  Summary
  Warren Buffett has famously said that most investors would be better off if they had a punch
card with 10 or 20 holes on it and that was all the investments they could make over the course
of their lives. The lesson is to make each investment count and don’t sell. I believe Scheid
Vineyards could be a “Warren Buffett punch card” investment.
  With the shares so undervalued, the long-term performance of the company so exemplary, and
the prime California vineyard land asset value, Scheid is a truly special situation with venture
capital like returns to the upside alongside substantial downside protection.
I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

   I think that CLWR is a short and is probably a zero or close to it.  The company is over-valued; hasn't made a dime since its inception; currently has negative EBIT, EBITDA, FCF, and Gross Profit; will need additional capital before it has any hope of becoming profitable; was unable to sell any equity in its recent financing; has low-quality and thus low-value spectrum; has substantial competition; has a major partner who is beginning to run into trouble themselves; has many unhappy current retail subscribers; and finally, is operating on a wireless broadband standard that is no longer being supported by most major players.
  Risks to my thesis
THE STOCK IS HEAVILY SHORTED SO THE SLIGHTEST PIECE OF GOOD NEWS COULD CAUSE A SIGNIFICANT RALLY IN THE SHARE PRICE. THE COMPANY COULD ANNOUNCE GOOD NEWS AS DISCUSSED BELOW IN THE VERY NEAR TERM. ALSO THE STOCK IS HARD TO BORROW.
According to the company, a resolution with Sprint on the wholesale pricing dispute is ""imminent"". If the two companies settle their dispute at a wholesale price higher than expected, then the shares will rally.
According to the company, they have received ""multiple bids"" for the spectrum they are trying to sell. If Clearwire sells some of its spectrum at prices higher than what the market is expecting or higher than the spectrum value implied by the current equity price then the stock could rally.
  Business
Basically, Clearwire is a 4G wireless broadband service provider that sells both to the retail and wholesale market.  The company ended Q4 2010 with approximately 4.4mln subscribers consisting of 1.1mln retail subscribers and 3.3mln wholesale subscribers.  Clearwire's wholesale business sells 4G service to its wholesale partners who then remarket the service under their own brand name.  Sprint is Clearwire's largest wholesale partner.  Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Bright House, Best Buy, and CBeyond.   Clearwire's retail services are marketed directly to consumers and are composed of various in-home (i.e. fixed) and mobile service offerings.
  Bear Case (in no particular order)
Clearwire equity is overvalued. Given the uncertainty in this situation, trying to build an accurate multi-year earnings model for CLWR is a waste of time. Thus I am attempting to approach the valuation question by assuming that things go really well for CLWR for the next five years and then stabilize after that which I think at this point given the company's history is generous. Assuming that CLWR's revenue doubles every year for the next five years (yes, this is a stretch but humor me) the company's revenue will be around $18bln in 2015. Sprint's Wireless segment margins (which is like an EBITDA margin) in 2010 were 15.8%. BTW, that is down from 33.3% in 2006 which clearly shows how competitive the wireless services business is but that is a different story. Sprint's margins include equipment subsidies so they are probably not perfectly comparable because CLWR's business will likely be mostly wholesale. However, the wholesale business has lower margins and there will be some equipment sales in CLWR's numbers so let's assume that CLWR's EBITDA margins in 2015 match those of Sprint's Wireless Segment currently and are around 16%. Using these assumptions gets us to $2.9bln in EBITDA in 2015. I will also assume that CLWR will not be a tax payer in 2015 so we don't have to worry about taxes. Sprint's total capex has averaged 11.2% of total sales over the last five years and was much higher in the years before that. Let's use 10% because it's a round number and I'm trying to give CLWR the benefit of the doubt. If we apply 10% against the estimated 2015 revenues of $18bln, we arrive at an estimated capex for that year of $1.8bln. As a point of reference, CLWR had $2.7bln of capex in 2010 and expects to have somewhere around $400-$500bln (in order to conserve cash) in 2011. So, based on my assumptions, EBITDA less capex will be $1.1bln in 2015. Now let's assume that interest expense and thus debt and cash stay constant at approximately $500mln per year which is where it will be in 2011 (yes, I know this is fantasy, but I'm trying to be as generous as reasonably possible). This leaves us with a very simple calculation of future free cash flow of $0.6bln (yes, there are other puts and takes but I am trying to illustrate a point). Now let's also assume that CLWR is able to maintain this level of FCF for the following five years at which point it is sold (or valued) in 2020 for a 5x EBITDA multiple allowing the equity in that year to realize $12bln of value ( 5x$2.9bln less $2.5bln of net debt = $12bln). If we discount these cash flows back to the present day at a 15% discount rate (a fair rate given that they recently priced debt at 12%) we arrive at a present value for the equity of $4.3bln or approximately $4.32 per share, or about 14% lower than the current share price. Now of course any first-year MBA could poke numerous holes in my quick and dirty analysis but the point I was trying to make is that even if things go well for this company over the next decade then the equity is still overvalued. Now let's add in some reality to my numbers. First, my pie-in-the-sky numbers assumed zero FCF for years 2011 to 2014. This will obviously not be the case as the company will likely burn multiple billions of capital over the next four years even without doubling revenues each year for the next five years. Second, it is highly unlikely that CLWR will double revenue every year for the next five years. For a point of comparison, Sprint's Wireless Service revenues have been flat to down every year since 2006 illustrating how highly competitive the wireless broadband space is. Also, at $18bln of revenue assuming a $10 wholesale ARPU (which is likely a high number given that the company implied the range in the current wholesale pricing negotiations with Sprint is between$ 4.50 and $9.00) that would mean a whopping 150mln wholesale subscribers. Even if you assume that the company is able to get to 10mln retail subs (unlikely especially given the company's recent statements that they are ""pacing"" their retail expansion) at a $45 ARPU, they would still need north of 100mln wholesale subs. This company will be lucky to hit $10bln of revenues by 2015 which would be an 82% CAGR. At that revenue level, even with my pie-in-the-sky margins, the equity is likely worth no more than $1.50-$2.00. Third, given the FCF losses that will occur over the next several years, assuming that debt stays constant at $4.3bln is silly, it will definitely be much higher unless the company is able to sell equity to finance its losses in which case the share count will be much higher. Anyway, I think I made my point. However, before I continue, some may suggest that CLWR's spectrum could be sold for enough to support the equity value. I am no expert here but recent Auction 86 (see buggs1815 CLWR writeup for links) was done at somewhere around $0.01 per Mhz-POP ($20.7mln for the full 76.5Mhz of which Clearwire was the buyer for half BTW). Clearwire has approx 46bln Mhz-POPs. Using even a $0.15 per Mhz-POP valuation (which is nearly 15x higher than the price paid per Mhz-POP in Auction 86) still produces only around $4.50 per share of equity value. Also, given that Clearwire has been trying to sell spectrum to raise capital and hasn't yet done so suggests to me that they aren't getting the price they need, much less the price they want.
The company hasn't made money since its inception in the late 1990s. Craig McCaw took over Clearwire in 2004 with high hopes for turning the company into a wireless broadband power house. Well, so far that hasn't happened and I must say that success still seems pretty far off. BTW, Craig McCaw resigned his post as Chairman of Clearwire in late December 2010.
Clearwire currently has negative Gross Margins, EBITDA, EBIT and FCF. In 2010, CLWR had ($370.6mln) in Gross Margin, ($1.8bln) in EBITDA, ($2.2bln) in EBIT and about ($3.8bln) in FCF. Wow, that WIMAX stuff sure is great!
The company will easily need at least an additional $2.0bln in capital and likely much more. Based on what I believe are aggressive street assumptions, Clearwire will have positive EBITDA by 2013. Using these numbers, the company will still need $2.0bln of additional capital and that assumes much reduced capex which doesn't reconcile with the company's statement that they want to double their presence to 240mln POPs in the next few years when it cost them around $2.7bln to go from 44.7mln POPs to 117mln in 2010. But let's assume the number is $2.0bln and the company raises that money via equity which is what management said they prefer to do. If $2.0bln is raised at the current $5.00 per share price using straight equity that would mean an additional 400mln shares which would obviously be massively dilutive. If the company is able to raise this capital via a sale of spectrum then that would be much better for them, but they have been trying to sell spectrum from the middle of last year without any success. This
The company has been saying for months that it would like to raise capital via equity. Yet, the most recent capital raise in December 2010 was done with 100% debt: 12% debt I might add. The first question that I have to ask myself is, ""If the asset is so valuable, then why are you so eager to sell equity?"" The next question I would ask is, ""If the asset is so valuable, then why is no one interested in buying equity?""
Clearwire's spectrum is low quality. I'm no scientist so on this topic I will only be repeating what I have read which is that the 2.5Ghz spectrum doesn't propagate well, doesn't penetrate barriers well and requires a greater density of towers to make it work well. These weaknesses are not only apparent in the numerous complaints from current Clearwire customers (see clearwiresucks.com) but they will also make it difficult for Clearwire to compete against the new LTE offerings from the likes of Verizon which is using the upper 700Mhz C-Block spectrum which doesn't have the same issues as the 2.5Ghz spectrum.
Clearwire will encounter significant competition starting immediately. Clearwire had the first-mover advantage in 4G and 4.4mln subs and $3.8bln of cash burn is all they were able to do with it. Verizon is currently in the process of launching a host of new devices (the Motorola Bionic, HTC Thunderbolt and the Motorola Xoom tablet) on its 4G LTE network and plans full nationwide coverage by 2013. Given the fact that one is rather hard-pressed to find a satisfied Clearwire user, I think that Verizon alone will represent significant competition, much less AT&T and the other carriers. A quick look at Sprint's numbers is all you need to see how competitive the wireless business is and that is will Sprint having rolled out 4G a year ago (much of it using Clearwire's network BTW). In addition, Clearwire is starting to see competition from the nascent Lightsquared which is reported to be in talks with T-Mobile on a spectrum purchase which would hurt Clearwire's ability to sell its own spectrum to raise capital. In addition, Lightsquared it reportedly in talks with Sprint to use its cell sites and equipment to help build out its network which could provide Sprint with another partner.
Sprint, currently Clearwire's most important partner, is having issues of its own. Sprint's wireless business has been going south since 2006 with Wireless Segment earnings dropping from $11.7bln in 2006 to only $4.5bln in 2010. With numbers like that, I would not be confident in an overly positive outcome from the wholesale pricing negotiations currently happening between Sprint and Clearwire.
Many current Clearwire retail subscribers do not like the service (see clearwiresucks.com). I've been finding it much easier to find complaints on Clearwire's service as opposed to praise. While this is obviously anecdotal, it, combined with anemic retail subscriber growth, is not a good sign.
Most major players are moving away from WIMAX. LTE is the standard that most in the wireless industry are coalescing around as their 4G standard. Clearwire management all but admitted this by saying that they could easily migrate their network to LTE by adding a radio in each tower at relatively little cost. So much for all of that money put into WIMAX.

Elevator Pitch
EXPE is a particularly asymmetric bet on a dramatic recovery of pent-up demand for leisure travel post-COVID.  If you believe leisure travel will not come back with a vengeance or that the vaccine will fail/COVID will mutate, this is not the idea for you.  In exchange for your lower rating though, I would appreciate evidence behind that view in the comments.  
  While shares today are above pre-COVID highs and the enterprise value is even higher, I believe the “bust” and imminent “boom” in leisure travel have obscured as well as expanded the opportunity for a significant restructuring at a business that has historically dramatically underperformed its key peer BKNG.  To put things simply, while I believe that consensus expectations for revenue not returning to 2019 levels until 2023 or later are far too conservative, the real opportunity in EXPE comes from the combination of significant operating leverage (80%+ GM’s) and a cost restructuring program that was in progress under a new CEO pre-COVID being accelerated and expanded during COVID, creating massive operating leverage which could result in post-COVID EBITDA beating consensus by 50% or even meaningfully more.  Further, many of the changes not only should improve EXPE’s cost structure but also their competitiveness, potentially driving improved market share, further exacerbating the operating leverage-driven upside.  Finally, we have all witnessed (perhaps in awe) the market’s propensity to simultaneously increase valuation multiple while estimates increase with COVID/WFH-beneficiaries.  I suspect EXPE could enjoy multiple expansion on top of significant estimate upside, driving very large upside.  Very simply (and I will provide more detail later on), I think it’s feasible that if “post-COVID run-rate” travel (IE 2H’21 or 2022) is only 5% above 2019 levels, when combined with the operating leverage and cost improvements, that EXPE could do $3.8bn of EBITDA (66% above consensus for 2022 and 200% above consensus for 2021).  If the shares trade at 11x EBITDA (a heavy discount to the market multiple, BKNG, and no multiple credit for Vrbo), they could be worth ~215 for 65%+ upside.  While this write-up will focus on the operating leverage and opportunity for rising earnings expectations, I would also note that you could make a very large valuation upside argument on a “sum of the parts” basis using an ABNB-style valuation on EXPE’s VRBO.  Such an analysis would indicate that by valuing Vrbo at even a 50% discount to ABNB on 2019 revenue or bookings, you are buying EXPE at ~5x EBITDA or lower.  
  Business Background
Shoe’s 3/30/19 writeup provides an excellent business overview and industry backdrop: https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/EXPEDIA_GROUP_INC/2332020226  My goal with this post is to provide an update on the significant changes in management and cost structure since then that create a particularly interesting situation today.  While I’d recommend you read his excellent piece, I’ll offer a quick 101 on the business as well.  
  EXPE is the second largest online travel agency after BKNG.  You go to Expedia or Hotels.com or Orbitz or Hotwire (all EXPE’s brands) to book your hotel, airline, etc.  EXPE takes a commission (~10% take rate blended) but a much higher on hotels than air and also varies based on the merchant vs agency model.  Pre-COVID, travel was an attractive secular growth market (experiences over things, growing wealth of emerging markets/china) and online travel agencies were gaining share from brick and mortar travel agencies.  EXPE’s biggest competitor (BKNG - previously PCLN/priceline, has an ~$80bn TEV vs EXPE’s ~$26bn TEV) was a growth/quality darling for many years with a healthy valuation multiple – secular growth of internet penetration growing within secular growth of travel, high margin, low capex business, big moat from network effect (more hotel supply -> more customers -> more hotel supply).  EXPE was frankly always the under-managed, red-headed stepchild and still appears to be that way today.  Their issues range from being more exposed to less attractive markets (air, US – which are less fragmented than European hotels where booking.com was the killer) to a major lack of integration on the back end of their different brands as well as cultural issues.  To put a finer point, EXPE’s EBITDA margin in 2019 was 17% vs BKNG’s was ~40%.  Some of that is due to scale, but our work with former employees indicates there’s a massive amount of bloat and inefficiency as well.  
  Over the last few years, the OTA’s have de-rated on a handful of major concerns: 
Disintermediation by hotels – hotels don’t like paying a 10%+ take rate and have made efforts to encourage customers to book direct via their loyalty programs 
Competition from Google de prioritizing EXPE's organic traffic 
AirBNB/alternative accommodations taking share 
  Today, BKNG and EXPE both trade at ~13x 2019 EBITDA.  While the above issues are real, travel is still a growing market and these are still relatively high quality (high margin, low capex) oligopolies.  Historically EXPE has converted >50% (in some cases >75%) of EBITDA into FCF.  
  2019 Issues, CEO Change, and 2020 Business Transformation 
In late 2019, EXPE faced a considerable string of setbacks:
SEO headwinds plagued the entire travel space as previously free “organic” traffic became paid 
Vrbo had particular challenges 
IT transition to cloud came in nearly 100% over budget 
  In response, Chairman Barry Diller (of IAC, previous owner of EXPE) fired the CEO and CFO, expanded the buyback authorization from 9mm to 29mm shares (~19% of the company), and installed himself and Vice Chairman Peter Kern in control with an intent to accelerate revenue growth in 2020 while improving margins.  
  Just as new mgmt. began to detail their plans for transforming the company, COVID hit and essentially brought the business to a grinding halt.  I suspect investors for the most part have been more focused on the complete lack of revenues more than the details of the dramatic ongoing overhaul in the business.  Further, I’d highlight that the nearly complete shutdown of demand provides essentially a once in a lifetime opportunity to do a full reset of EXPE’s cost structure and technology infrastructure under a new CEO:
  “But since we've had these lower levels of throughput, we felt the unique opportunity to try to push through significant technology change and things that might have taken months and months, or years, to push through and put them on an agenda to push them through much more quickly. So the company is just way more focused on changing, changing quickly, and getting to the other side of a lot of what have been thorny technology issues as rapidly as we can.” – Peter Kern, Q1’20 Call 
  On the first earnings call (Q4’19 on 2/13/20), just as the world was about to begin to understand the implications of COVID on travel, new mgmt. began to detail their plan to rip out ~$300-500mm of cost savings (15-25% of 2019 EBITDA) with more efficient marketing spend and greater collaboration across brands and business units driving double-digit 2020 EBITDA growth.  Within days, EXPE would announce an ~12% headcount reduction, which on ~3k jobs at ~$100k implies ~$290mm of cost saves alone.  By their latest earnings call (3Q, Nov 2020), EXPE has increased their cost cut guidance to $900-950mm, with ~$550mm already executed on at a run-rate.  Below I detail the buckets of cost reduction, and most importantly, what’s not included in it:
  Fixed Cost: $700-750mm on a base of ~$3.5bn of 2019 fixed costs 
Primarily personnel/headcount as well as procurement, tech licenses, real estate footprint
Some of these savings will be partially offset by inflation 
~$550mm run-rate already achieved 
“So, first, on fixed cost bases, as you'll recall, we started the year targeting $300 million to $500 million, in annualized savings. And we were tracking ahead of that amount, as of our last call. Since then, we've identified additional head count reductions in certain areas and incremental opportunities across the P&L to drive efficiency, in areas like real estate and software and licensing. We are now targeting $700 million to $750 million in annualized run rate savings, compared to our 2019 exit rate. And we've already auctioned over $550 million. As you project this forward, please keep in mind, we'll have annual increases in the remaining cost base, and also make targeted investments in some areas. But overall, we've made great progress on fixed costs. And longer term, our platform operating model will position us, to scale the business far more efficiently going forward.” – Q3’20 Call 
Variable Costs (based on 2019 revenue levels): $200mm on a base of ~$1.6bn in 2019 variable costs ex marketing
Lower transaction fees and improving economics on virtual cards used for merchant payments 
Extend conversation platform to handle more customer calls through self-service and virtual agents to lower customer service costs 
Optimizing cloud variable spend 
Interestingly, some of these cost improvements could also materially improve the end customer experience – customers don’t like waiting on hold if they can get what they need done via a simple chat interface and it obviously saves a ton of expenses as well
“But I think the one that has the largest opportunity for us is on the conversation platform. We are historically primarily a phone-based contact center-type of conversations with customers and with our supply partners as well. And with the technology that we've developed, we have the ability to move a lot of those either to self-service or virtual agent. And on the virtual agent side, we're able to get more – service more customers, if you will, per agent. And so, both of those add leverage to the system.  And we've really started the roll out. In fact, we've gotten good NPS scores and good returns, if you will from doing that. And it's really a process of rolling that out, making sure that we have more and more use cases, we get it embedded into the right flows into the sites, into the mobile apps as well. And I think that is likely the largest opportunity. And then credit card costs and variable cloud as well are meaningful, but I would say that those two are a distant second, if you will, after the conversation platform opportunity.” – Q3’20 Call 
“The NPS scores have been strong on it. People generally like to deal with the machine if they can and just get it over with, and not have to talk to a person. It's not true universally, but that seems to be true for most people. And we feel very good about it. So it's scaling up.” – Q3’20 Call 
“We get confidence in those that we get better line of sight in. And then also obviously, we've actioned a fairly large percentage of it. So, yes, it's the $700 million to $750 million on a fixed cost basis, and then the incremental $200 million on the variable costs of sales, which then approaches, to your math, approximately $1 billion in savings. Now you mentioned it, but I just want to reiterate it as well. That is on the 2019 exit rate, if you will, so that those numbers presume that we're back in a range that is approximately at the 2019 levels.” -Q3’20 Call 
Shockingly, these cost savings above of ~$900-950mm do not include savings in direct marketing, where EXPE spent $5bn+ on ~$12bn of revenue in 2019! 
While the quantified costs alone are a giant opportunity to improve profitability themselves, we actually believe this bucket could be even larger 
Historically, all of EXPE’s different brands operated in silo’s (see consultant comments below)
Not only did this result in duplicative infrastructure and people costs, and a lack of shared best practices, it resulted in different EXPE flags bidding against each other

“And I'm excited about what we're going to be able to see when we can see the granular level of detail on profitability by customers, by geos, by everything, which we haven't had the granularity we like, and that has made us, I would say, a blunter instrument than we'd like to be. And we believe there's significant good guys from getting us all wired together. And that again is why we're willing to make short-term trade-offs to do that important work to get that done, but we haven't seen any early returns yet and it will be a little while still.” – Q3’20 Call 
“I would say on the performance marketing side, you are correct. We have talked historically about bringing more efficiency out of it, getting our return on marketing better, more precise, et cetera. The problem was I think that was to, some extent, wishful thinking because we did not have all the data, all the tooling and all the approaches synchronized, if you will. We let our brands compete. That has some dissynergies that never were quantified, but certainly existed. We did not have the benefit of all the data, because each brand had its own data and on and on and on.  So, I am positively optimistic that when we have all data flows right and we have all the algorithms rewritten for that and when we have the tooling right, there should be significant upside for us in actually getting – bringing out that return that you've heard about over these many years” – Q3’20 Call 
“So my big push has been, if we have a brand, frankly, that maybe none of you have heard of, like Wotif in Australia, that is our strongest brand for the moment in Australia, then we need to concentrate on building that brand and not worry about whether it's Expedia or Hotels.com or anything else.  Likewise, Vrbo has a different brand, a different company that acquired in Australia that we're not going to change that brand, because it's a strong local brand and we should push into that. We have historically had this record of, okay, we have an existing brand or we bought a brand, we're also going to push Expedia into that market. We're also going to push Hotels.  And that kind of, I would say, took away the value of multi-brand, because it didn't allow us to optimize for each one. So that's why we're doing the segmentation work. That's why we're trying to figure out what the proposition is for each brand. Some brands admittedly, we have historically run for more profit, whereas others we have pushed.  We're looking at that whole kind of fleet of options and driving the best result by country, by brand that we can. And that may mean, we close some brands in some countries. That may mean, potentially, we close some brands full stop, but we have no intention right now to do that, but we are looking at the whole thing and trying to optimize for it all. But we think, in general, having more gives us the opportunity to do more, if we do it smartly.”- Q3’20 Call 
“This is about building better products, doing better brand and direct marketing, better merchandising, which has not been a great strength of ours and, in general, using the data we have, which again have never been pulled together as a company and has only been together for the last few months to power our ability to do all of those things: to understand our customer better, to serve them better, to serve up choices for them better, everything.  So we believe we have huge opportunities on that front. And we believe that we've been overly reliant, and we've heard this before, on performance marketing. We've not been disciplined about it. We've chased on healthy growth over the years. And Google and other performance marketing channels have tried to disintermediate us, and we've made some not terribly smart choices along the way.  We believe that this reset of the virus will give us an opportunity. I mean, we've been talking about this for a while. But as we wade back into the marketplace, to be much more disciplined to only chase real growth, real valuable growth, healthy growth, and not be stuck chasing performance marketing and entering into dis-economic auctions. So we intend to be much better about that. We intend to keep those customers longer. We intend to serve them better and keep those direct relationships going strong.” – Q1’20 Call 
  Is the magnitude of transformation opportunity as large as the company contends?  
Below I present some excerpts from calls with experts/consultants.  Some of these are actually in the public domain via a subscription expert network that I suspect many of you have access to the full transcript.  If posting these excerpts are frowned upon, please do let me know and I apologize and will remove.  
  “I think the biggest thing in my mind is that the prior strategy, Dara's strategy just made no sense whatsoever. And I came in from McKinsey, and within like a month of looking at the business from the inside, I couldn't really tell this from the outside, but I honestly thought of leaving after a month because I thought, like, this is a company that has not been doing the right thing for years.  Just the strategy was explicitly that the brands would compete with each other and that through competition, they would become stronger. And it was just a very myopic view as though other competitors did not exist and that we can afford this terrible inefficiency. So like the President of Hotels.com was not invited to the strategy, the annual strategy planning of the President of Expedia.com, specifically because they were competitors, and they didn't want that competitive information out to each other.  So like you mentioned it, the biggest cost is probably on the marketing side, just bidding up their own keywords, bidding against each other. And I think I was never able to get data to support this, but I was running down a hypothesis that we were actually paying multiple times for the same shopper when Booking would only pay once.”
“So you can imagine this customer behavior. They go to Google, and they might right-click on multiple links. And they might right-click once on Booking, and then they might click on Expedia, Hotels.com and Travelocity, not realizing that they're all the same company and all the same inventory and largely the same prices. So we've just paid 3x for a customer that maybe we get them, but still, we paid more than Booking would have if they got them.”
“I had a discussion once with the President of Hotwire.com, which is a relatively very small brand. And she had come from Hotels.com, and she was saying, I don't know what my SEM team is doing. Like we're start-up level sophistication here. They're trying to figure out stuff that is really elementary.”
“I've got a really mediocre, tiny SEM team, and they're figuring out stuff that Hotels.com figured out long ago. Like why can't we just take what Hotels.com is doing and apply it to Hotwire? And the answer was, well, because Hotels.com has no incentive to work with you, to spend any time with you in doing that. And so that's one example of duplication.  But then if you think about the SEM team at Hotels.com and how sophisticated they were with data scientists and PhDs, and then that is completely duplicated at Expedia.com where there's a completely separate team, really no sharing of best practices. So now that there's one head over all the marketplaces and has been for now like 9 months, but still, that person has to look at those teams and say, ""Okay, we really only need one team.""
“And like I did an analysis once where I stripped away everything at Expedia and Booking to try to make it apples-to-apples. And ultimately, I can't remember the exact numbers, but basically, we took $3 of marketing expense and turned it into $6. And they were trying to get it to like $12 or something like that, maybe it was $9.”
“Hidden Asset” Upside
 I’m loathe to call this a significant part of my thesis as everyone knows that EXPE owns Vrbo and that ABNB trades at a very healthy valuation.  No one will care until they do and I have no view that EXPE will or should monetize Vrbo.  That said, I’ll allow you, the reader, to pick your poison for reaching a target valuation.  Additionally, I would note that Barry Diller has a track record of monetizing assets at IAC.  
  VRBO did ~$12bn of alternative accommodations bookings in 2019 vs ABNB at ~$38bn.  In 2020, VRBO actually only shrank 24% vs ABNB shrinking 40%, implying that VRBO actually gained share in 2020.  Vrbo is more focused on whole homes, which obviously resonated well during COVID.  It remains to be determined whether Vrbo can retain this fortuitous growth in mindshare.  
“I do think that to your question specific to Vrbo, we are getting a lot of people experimenting with and hopefully being very happy and satisfied with the alternative accommodation experience and in particular for us, Vrbo's main emphasis on the whole home.  So I think there may well be people out there who are not as familiar either with our brand or with the experience, who are now getting to experience it and having very satisfying great trips. And I think that's a great opportunity for us to create long-term customer stickiness and value.” – Q2’20 Call
  ABNB, with an ~$100bn EV, trades at ~3x 2019 bookings and ~24x 2019 revenue.  Even taking a 50% discount to these multiples, Vrbo would be worth ~$16-17bn or ~60% of EXPE’s current EV.  At full parity, Vrbo would be worth $30bn+ and thus more than EXPE’s entire EV.  Vrbo currently represents ~15% (~$280mm) of EXPE’s 2019 EBITDA, so if you “stub” that out, you could argue we’re buying EXPE for 2-5x 2019 EBITDA or even for free.  I present the math below for fun, but again – the crux of my thesis is that there is a massive amount of “pent up” earnings power.  
  Additionally, Vrbo currently monetizes at an ~10% take rate vs ABNB at an ~14% take rate, so one could argue it is also under-earning.  RE Vrbo Take Rate: “There a is gap between us and Airbnb in particular, and it's something that we do feel that it's – it gives us a bit of an advantage with consumers, but it is something that we are looking at. It is something that we test. We do think there are opportunities to increase monetization over time. But I would say there continues to be a gap, we are actively looking at that. We are actively testing it. And I do think that there is upside in our monetization over time.” – Q3’20 Call
    I would also note that EXPE’s B2B business may be under-appreciated as well.  While I don’t have the economics broken out as well for the purposes of spreadsheet heroics, it’s worth noting the quality and strong growth of this part of the business (which does represent ~$450mm in 2019 or ~ 20% of the business), again via consultants: 
  “ So that business is like the shining star of the business. And I used to say, like, ""Hey, if we can't get our act together on the consumer side and figure out how to actually be a customer-centric company, then our future is B2B and B2B only, which is not as big a business.  (…) But that B2B affiliate business, it's an amazing business and was growing like crazy. It's got probably the most capable leader at Expedia, Ariane Gorin, and was growing by leaps and bounds.”
“So for Expedia, several years back, I mean it was a stroke of genius. They were like, ""We've got all of the supply. We're spending the money to acquire the supply anyway. And we're doing that for the OTA business, for our B2C business. And the B2C business is funding that activity. So if we were to sell at B2B, we're sort of funding our competitors, but like what do we care? We're taking a cut of it. And if it gets booked through a competitor, we'd rather take a chunk of it rather than nothing.  (…)  And so there are thousands of affiliates and then some very large programs like Expedia runs Amex's travel program for their credit card rewards. They do the same for Chase and some other really big credit card programs. And those are huge. I mean Amex does, I think, like $4 billion of gross bookings, which is like 4% of Expedia's bookings, and they're just a credit card company.  They're also kind of like a reasonably sized OTA. And so that's a great business for Expedia. It's low cost. They need a sales team, and they need some technology to make these APIs, but the technology is not anything like running the OTA side.” 
“We're also heavily interested and excited about the opportunity in the B2B side and in helping our supply partners. We've talked before about our Expedia Partner Services business. We are a leader in this space, and we feel very good about our opportunity here. In fact, we believe we can grow share here during COVID as we help our B2B partners come out faster and help more partners over time. We have expanded our partnership on the supply side with Marriott in terms of their wholesale distribution partnership. And we are extending that partnership, similar partnerships to optimize distribution with other chain partners. And we think that's going to be a great opportunity to help our supply partners and also build our B2B business.” – Q3’20 Earnings Call 
Valuation, Risk/Reward 
Let’s try to put this all together.  There’s obviously massive, uncontrollable macro drivers in the background, but my goal is to isolate the skew in earnings power vs current expectations rather than nail an exact number and exact date.  Below, I break out 4 discrete drivers: stated cost savings, unquantified cost savings (direct marketing), magnitude of revenue rebound vs 2019 levels, and fixed cost inflation.  Below, I show my “base” case – success on $900mm of cost saves,  $300mm of performance marketing improvement (5% of spend), and revenue 5% above 2019 levels.  This gets to ~$3.8bn of EBITDA, 65% above 2022 consensus.   
    Acknowledging the imprecision of this exercise, below is a sensitivity for a bear case (fixed cost reductions only, revenue -7.5% below 2019 levels, 5% fixed cost inflation despite revenues below 2019) which gets to just below 2022 consensus of ~$2.2bn of EBITDA.  I also show a range of “bull” cases where performance marketing savings are 5-7% of 2019 levels and revenue ends up 7-12% above 2019 levels offset by 5-10% of cost inflation.  I’d argue that the higher the revenue growth, the lower marketing savings and more cost inflation there is, so these cases don’t really move the final number that much from $4.1-4.4bn (80-90% above consensus), but rather just show the different permutations and moving pieces to get there.  
    Finally, I’ll leave it to the reader to pick a multiple to apply.  EXPE has historically traded ~9-13x EBITDA at a healthy discount to BKNG in the mid-teens.  If they are actually getting some momentum in terms of running the business better, I’d argue that gap should close a bit, and I’d also argue that with ~20% of the business from Vrbo, that that should drive a higher EBITDA multiple as well.  Nonetheless, I show a range of multiples from 8-14x below on $2.1bn (bear case) to $4.5bn (high end of bull case) EBITDA.  I’ve shaded 3 sets of numbers – a “bear case” that represents 10-11x on $2.2bn of EBITDA for 20-30% downside, a base case that represents 10-11x EBITDA on ~$3.7bn of EBITDA for 43-60% upside, and a bull case that is 11-12x on $4.1bn of EBITDA for 80%-100% upside.  If you want to really pound the table, you could argue a much higher multiple using the Vrbo/ABNB analysis above.  I would flag that there has been significant share dilution YTD from warrants issued to Silver Lake and Apollo, so I am using a share count of around 160 rather than the ~140 shown on BBG.  
  Lastly, I should note that while my focus is on the post-COVID opportunity, I would be remiss in not pointing out the current pressures (booking -90% YoY in Q2’20 improving to -69% YoY in 3Q’20) that the balance sheet is well positioned now to survive to the other side, whenever that is, with $4.4bn of liquidity and cash flow neutral as of September for the first time since February.  
  Key Risks 
EXPE has a weak history of execution and has historically underperformed BKNG 
Aforementioned secular risks around hotel loyalty programs, Google, AirBNB
COVID-related travel disruptions and delays in vaccine roll-outs
4Q/1Q results likely rocky given resurgence in COVID
EXPE’s adjusted results are relatively low quality (~$240mm of SBC, $200mm of amort of intangibles such as capitalized R&D) and this is a reasonable argument for a discount to BKNG

I suspect this is a debate that will come down to anecdata and gut feels.

Nabors Industries Ltd. (NYSE: NBR) is the largest land drilling contractor in the world. On revenues of $5.9 billion, the Company is expected to generate $2.1 billion in EBITDA in FY2011. Based on term contracts in hand, approximately 55% of FY2012 EBITDA is already locked in, and on forecasted sales of $6.4 billion, I expect NBR to generate ~ $2.2 billion in EBITDA in FY2012. At current prices, this enterprise trades at a 4.1x and 3.0x multiple of FY2011 and FY2012 estimated EBITDA. Two months ago, the stock traded at $30 per share and now is down below $15 per share while underlying fundamentals of the business have continued to improve. With a lifting of the moratorium in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico earlier this year, and 10 to 15 new rigs scheduled to start work in Saudi Arabia and Iraq, the offshore and international land divisions are poised for a strong recovery. Major E&P's and IOC's, who represent a majority of the Company's customer list, tend to take a longer view on commodity prices and are unlikely to suddenly halt their exploratory drilling programs.
Yet, with a dimmed view of the economy and its impact on oil demand and therefore drilling, the Street has appears to be pricing in a complete implosion of the business. NBR is a strong franchise that, in my view, is extremely well positioned to benefit from the growing global scarcity of cheap oil and gas. By my estimates, this Company should earn ~ $3.26 per share in FY2013 - the stock trades at less than a 5 multiple of this earnings estimate!

Swisher Hygiene (""Swisher"" or the ""Copmany"") is one of the most compelling short opportunities I have ever seen.  Over the past several years, I have posted recommendations on many shorts (MOTR, GDOT, IGTE, BTIM, IMGG, STEC and BPZ) - every one is profitable since the post and two (BPZ and IMGG) are down over 80%.  Still, I can't say I have ever encountered a situation quite like Swisher.
  Background
  Swisher provides cleaning services to commercial clients such as restaurants, hospitals, retail stores, etc.   Simply, (i) they deliver soap, toilet paper and towels to their clients, (ii) provide mops and floor mats, (iii) clean the bathrooms and (iv) throw away the trash.  As you can imagine, this is not a particularly great business, margins are thin and in fact, Swisher does not even generate an operating profit. 
In 2004, Swisher was acquired for around $15 million by Wayne Huizenga and Steven Berrard (Huizenga's business partner and former CEO of Blockbuster and Autonation) from original founder Patrick Swisher.  Berrard is Swisher's CEO.  Incidently, Patrick Swisher served jail time for tax evasion and the company had issues with accounting restatements, auditor withdrawals and expense report infractions.  Since the acquisition, Huizenga and Berrard have sunk about $64 million of equity in the business and incurred debt of $41 million to try to grow the company and  buy up certain Swisher franchises. 
In August 2010, Swisher was merged into Cool Brands (ticker:  SWI CN), a publicly-traded Canadian shell company.  Cool Brands was an ice cream and frozen yogurt company founded in the 1980s by brothers Michael and Aaron Serruya.  The company grew through acquisitions and eventually busted from too much debt, poor operations and accounting issues.  The business was ultimately sold and the shell had $65 million in cash at the time of the merger with Swisher.  Cool Brands had a 52% pro forma stake and Swisher had a 48% pro forma stake of the public entity, effectively valuing Swisher at around $65 million as recently as last August.  It seems the link up in these two companies can be tied back to Jamba Juice (ticker: JMBA), a Berrard-led SPAC in which Michael Serruya is a board member.  Jamba Juice is down 75% since its public listing.
Over the past several years, Swisher's revenues have been flat at around $65 million.  The Company has consistently lost between $6 and $10 million per year.  Additionally, at December 31, 2010, the Company had only $9 million in tangible assets. 
In February 2011, Swisher purchased a solid waste company called Choice Environmental for $92 million (cash and stock), representing a multiple of 10x EBITDA and 16x EBIT.  Additionally, Swisher has done multiple private placements to swell its share count.  Pro forma for the acquisition, we estimate Swisher will have $110 million of revenues and lose around $5 million per year.
Since the merger last August, Swisher's stock is up almost 10-fold and with approximately 149 million shares currently outstanding, the market capitalization of Swisher is $1.5 billion or 14x revenues!
What is going on here?
This is one of the most distorted situations we have ever seen.  We can only imagine that certain investors are enamored with the idea of backing Huizenga and Berrard.  Both individuals have been promoting the company.  The idea is that somehow they can roll up small mom and pop bathroom cleaners and turn this into a large company.  Despite the notable past successes, it is worth pointing out that recent Berrard ventures have been a disaster (Jamba Juice and now bankrupt flower shop roll-up Gerald Stevens).  There is no clear business logic or synergy to buying small, local bathroom cleaners in our view.
Huizenga and Berrard are also locked up until early 2012 which may be leading to the distortion in the valuation.  We do believe that investors are still confused about the facts here.  The stock was only recently listed on the Nasdaq, the company is not covered by Wall Street and the company hasn't had any quarterly calls yet. 
What is it worth?
We believe Swisher is worth no more $2.00 per share in an optimistic case (which would represent 80+% downside).  More realistically, it is probably worth $0.00 - $1.00 (which would represent 90% to 100% downside). 
One approach to valuation here is looking at the net capital invested in the business ($15 million for Swisher + $106 million of debt and equity invested over time + $92 million for Choice Environmental + $26 million for other recent acquisitions + approximately $50 million net cash) / 149 million shares or  $2 per share. 
We also can look to at possible trading multiples assuming the company achieved a positive operating margin.  We think a best case operating margin for this business is between 5% and 10% (company targets EBITDA margins of 15%, obviously before D&A costs) which would put operating profit $6 to $11 million.  At a generous 8x - 12x multiple, the enterprise value of the company would be between $50 million to $130 million representing an equity value of $100 million to $180 million or $0.70 to $1.20 per share.
Catalysts
Shares issued in acquisitions will have to be registered soon and we know we have a huge wave of lock up expirations in early 2012.  As this stock gets more investor attention and people realize what is really going on here, we believe it will likely end up in the toilet well before Huizenga and Berrard can dump their shares.

(Chart based on Value Line estimates for FY07)
    On the face of it, one might be thinking where the value is here given the Company’s history and the fact that it is now trading at 11.9x EBITDA, in-line to higher than its two larger ad agency brethren, Omnicom and WPP Group.  However, as one can see in the chart above, IPG’s EBITDA margins are 650-800 bps lower than its peers.  Given that IPG is not too different from these other ad agency competitors, there is no reason why a successful turnaround executed by a capable management team can’t result in IPG’s profitability being more in-line with its peers.  Moreover, due its status as the world’s third largest ad conglomerate that owns several venerable ad agencies, there is the possibility that another ad agency could acquire IPG (in fact, there have been rumors of an acquisition by Publicis--although IPG has denied having any discussions about an acquisition).    On an EV/Sales basis, IPG is trading 0.6x less than the 1.6x-1.7x EV/sales ratios of OMC and WPP.  Thus the market is not pricing in the true turnaround potential of the business, which I believe has a very good chance of occurring.  The turnaround involves two major components:  1) the elimination of costs incurred as a result of poor financial controls, Sarb/Ox compliance, management turmoil/turnover poor optimization of assets post the rollup of several businesses in the 1990s;  2) With its financial and compliance house in order, IPG can then focus on gaining more client wins than losses so that organic growth can be restored to industry-wide levels (5%-6%).  A rationalized cost structure and peer-like revenue growth would cause the company to be valued similarly to peers at 1.6x sales or 10-11x EBITDA (with EBITDA margins at the 15% level).   The absolute dollar amount of EBITDA could get to $1+ BN by 2008-2009.  IPG’s stock has run up over the past few months, however a good entry point has presented itself as Wal-Mart dropped IPG agency Draft FCB from its roster of agencies after awarding the creative and media account to DraftFCB in late Oct. (IPG’s stock dropped 6.4% on Dec. 7th).  However, this win was more about the headline more than the actual financial impact, which would have added a modest $20-$30MM in annual net revenue.  The bottom line is that IPG has had significantly more client wins vs. losses overall, which is likely to lead to continued organic revenue growth over the next few years.
  Description and History of IPG: 
IPG is the third largest advertising and marketing services agency in the world (behind US-based Omnicom and UK-based WPP Group), operating through offices in 130+ countries.  It was initially incorporated as McCann-Erickson in 1930, based on the original ad agencies founded by the respective partners in the early 1900s.  IPG is organized into two main divisions: The Integrated Agency Networks segment (or IAN) is comprised of McCann, FCB Group, Lowe, Draft, Campbell-Ewald, Hill Holliday and Deutsch. (all these agencies together represent about 85% of revenues and operating income). Traditional advertising agencies (such as those represented by the IAN group) create, design and place advertising into various traditional media such as TV, newspaper and magazines.  The Constituency Management Group (CMG, the other 15% Of the business) includes Weber Shandwick, MWW Group, FutureBrand DeVries, Golin Harris, and Octagon Worldwide, which provide PR, meeting/event production, sports/entertainment marketing, corporate and brand identity and strategic marketing consulting services.  Marketing services, often referred to as “non-traditional advertising”, encompasses all other aspects of advertising, including newer media such as internet and direct marketing.
  During the 1990s, IPG was the quintessential “rollup of ad agency rollups”, acquiring dozens companies (some of which had just merged together themselves) to the point where the cost structure became egregiously bloated and management was unable to integrate (or even get a handle on) the disparate companies successfully.  Coupled with the economic/ad downturn of 2001/2002 and the discovery of accounting discrepancies due to poor financial controls, the Company’s reputation was damaged and it began to experience client losses, causing EBITDA margins to plummet from to 3.2% in FY05.  David Bell, (former CEO of True North Communications, an IPG subsidiary) was appointed as Chairman/CEO in 2003, and was tasked with straightening out IPG’s financial controls and improving its balance sheet.  However, given that there was no unified IT platform, no financial controls, poor oversight over compliance/procedures, and insufficient an internal audit/accounting staff internal, extensive bookkeeping problems were discovered (primarily in its overseas operations) and IPG had to restate financials going back to FY00.  These restatements included improper accounting of vendor discounts/credits, customer contracts, out-of-pocket expenses, leases,  and compensation expense (associated w/ options).   Post the restatement, revenues increased by an aggregate of $983MM, operating expenses increasing by $1.38BN, and shareholder equity was reduced by $550MM.  Most of these  numbers dealt with revenue/expense recognition issues and the cash impact was around $200MM.   In 2005, as these problems were surfacing, former MONY Group chief Michael Roth took the CEO spot (he was appointed Chairman in 2004), to continue the work Bell had started.  Bell finally left the company in early 2006.
  While this history is a clearly an accumulation of a bad fact pattern, the bottom line is that these problems are ones that are fixable;  Michael Roth thus far has appeared to be doing a good job in executing the turnaround, reducing costs, and actually winning new clients after some notable defections occurred in the prior few years.  Winning new clients is the lifeblood of this business, something the market has been clearly worried about with IPG given that organic revenue growth was flat/down over the past few years given the large client defections.  This year, organic revenue is actually up (was up 2.7% in 3Q) due to some recent client wins.
  In March of this year, management provided more details on the turnaround plan, which would result in operating margins of 10% by FY08 (still 400 bps below peers).  It would be achieved by: 1) generating industry revenue growth of 5%-6%; 2) taking $200MM of transitional costs out of the expense base; 3) lowering SG&A as a percent of sales to 59% (vs. 63.7% in FY05); 4) reducing overall overhead expenses.  Management is well on track to achieve these metrics and I actually believe they are being pretty conservative if one looks more closely at the components of cost structure rationalization and leveraging of cash flow that would occur from organic revenue growth.  Admittedly, it may take a year or two beyond 2008 to achieve EBITDA margins in the 15% range, however, to the extent that it appears to the market as being achievable, the valuation gap between IPG and its peers would close (esp. on an EV/Sales basis) probably 1-2 years ahead of the Company achieving that performance.
  Rationalizing the Cost Structure:
As the product of dozens of acquisitions that were never properly integrated and not subject to real financial/reporting controls, further analysis demonstrates that IPG has approximately $415MM in costs that can be completely eliminated in a successful turnaround in an amount that far exceeds management’s near term targets;  these include costs for professional fees, temporary help, Sarb/Ox compliance, non-rationalized real estate, severance and expenses associated with having 1,300+ separate legal entities:
  FYE06 EBITDA
$416
Prof. Fees
$225
Severance Savings
$40
Real Estate/Rent Optimization
$60
Temporary Help Savings
$90
Adj. EBITDA
$831
    Sales
$6,178
Adj. EBITDA Margin %
13.5%
  IPG’s  ‘transitional expenses’ peaked in FY05 at a combined level of $477MM (includes prof. fees, severance, temporary help).  In FY06, the company made considerable progress on reducing these expenses (forecast to be about $340MM for all of FY06)  Most of this is comprised of professional fees, primarily related to Sarb/Ox compliance and improving financial reporting systems and largely represents the hiring of consultants, accountants, lawyers and other personnel to help fix the financial control/reporting, reduce the number of global financial platforms (currently has 150 and wants to move to 4 over next few years) and reduce the number of subsidiaries to 800 from a current 1,300.  Over time, these fees can be completely eliminated.
  Severance:  Due to declining turnover and the significant amount of new talent that is now in place, this cost can be reduced by $40MM per year to a more normalized level of about $25MM per year.
  Temporary Help:  represents the hiring of temps primarily for corporate/OH/accounting functions.  As financial controls and reporting costs come down and turnover on the creative side is reduced, , temporary help can be reduced to 1% of revenue from the current 2.5%-3%  (represents about $90MM in expense savings).
  Rent:  Compared to its peers OMC and WPP, IPG pays significantly more in rent per employee because it has more under-utilized square footage as real estate was never really rationalized post the late 1990-rollups.   With 43k employees, IGP pays rent (property and equipment) of $8,800 per employee, versus OMC, which pays rent of $7,600 per employee and WPP pays around $7,000 per employee.  Assuming savings of $1,300 per employee if R/E were rationalized, IPG could end up saving $55MM in rent.  Looking at square footage, IPG has 316 sq. feet of real estate per employee vs. WPP’s 240 sq. ft.  Assuming that IPG could reduce sq. footage to WPP’s levels and assuming a rental rate of $20/sq. ft on 43,000 employees, that could save $65MM in rental expense.  Thus I assumed an annual savings of around $60MM over the next few years if management can further rationalize real estate to the level more commensurate with peers.
  Based on its current revenues, IPG is overstaffed (excluding temp workers) considering revenue/employee is significantly below those of its competitors (IPG at $145k/employee vs. $169k for OMC), suggesting that expense savings can be even greater than what is outlined above.  However, for the purposes of this analysis, I will assume that the lack of productivity per employee is partly due to sub-par organic revenue growth—something that the company can bolster now that its financial house is in order and the company appears to have been able to salvage its reputation and win new clients.
  Revenue Growth Opportunity:
Management changes at IPG have clearly had a positive impact on the business.  Since the appointment of Michael Roth as CEO, revenue declines have subsided and turned positive in 2006.  When Roth took the helm, he met with IPG’s large clients to reassure them that staying with the company was the appropriate decision and that IPG was making progress in fixing its problems.  He also helped upgrade the talent pool by making several key senior-level hires to the company and improved accountability standards  for individual performance.  Frank Mergenthaler was appointed CFO in July 2005 (formerly CFO of Columbia House) is overseeing the implementation of financial controls/reporting (via SAP).  Other recent hires include Steve Blamer to head the FCB businesses (former CEO of Grey Worldwide), Nick Brien as CEO of Universal McCann (formerly CEO of Arc Worldwide) and Steve Gatfield as CEO of Lowe Worldwide (previously EVP of Global Operations and Innovation).  
  After posting an organic revenue decline of 0.7% in FY05, organic revenue is up 1.4% YTD in FY06, with growth of 2.7% during the 3Q, which is fairly respectable vs WPP (+4.7%) and other global ad agencies such as Publicis (up 2.6%) and Havas (up 1.9%).  Key client wins in FY06 include Gateway, Supervalu, AOL, Merril Lynch and Lion’s Gate films.  Recently, Wal-Mart dropped IPG agency DraftFCB from its roster of agencies after awarding the account to DraftFCB and Aegis (another IPG agency) in late October.  Wal-Mart stated that it is reopening the account pitch and that Draft FCB will not be able to participate due to “new information (Walmart) received over the last few weeks.”  WMT also said that two of its senior marketing executives that were responsible for the account decision were asked to leave the company.  While impossible to truly confirm, I don’t believe that this loss is reflective on Graft’s or IPGs ability to win future business.  While there is definitely headline risk associated with the account loss, WMT was not a top 20 client for IPG and the estimated financial contribution from the account would have been small, about $30MM in annual revenues, and WMT was just one of a long list of new accounts won by Draft/FCB this year.  IPG’s other agencies would actually also be allowed to participate in the account pitch (evidence that WMT doesn’t seem to have a problem with IPG as a company, and that the loss may be related to cozy relationships or improper behavior of WMT’s marketing execs).   It was reported in the WSJ that DraftECB threw a large dinner party in NY, inviting its largest accounts and people familiar with the situation said that the WMT marketing execs attended even though WMT has a very strict corporate policy on employees receiving gifts from vendors/service providers (even receiving one free meal could construe a violation of corporate policy).
  IPG’s goal is to achieve “peer-level” organic revenue growth of 5%-6% a year by FY08.  Let’s assume it does 3% next year and 5% in FY08, levels that are reasonable considering the significantly improved results in the 3Q as well as the recent client wins.  That would imply over $500MM in incremental revenues, which would have a high contribution margin considering the transitional costs currently in IPG’s structure as well as below-average revenue/employee, and high occupancy expense/sq. footage per employee.   IPG has a goal of achieving a 59% salary expense margin, which would be a variable cost, and office/general expenses would be largely fixed—however I assumed that O&G expense would incrementally increase by $25MM or 5% of revenues vs. about 20% on a company-wide given the low productivity per employee (labor force can be better optimized). Under these assumptions, $500MM in revenue would result in EBITDA of about $170MM.   Looking at IPG’s  revenue/employee based on this new revenue (and assuming no headcount increase or reduction),  the metric would be about $155k, which is still below the $169k of Omnicom, suggesting that that there may actually be upside to the incremental revenue and EBITDA contribution if IPG achieves productivity levels similar to its peers.
  Industry consolidation will likely continue:  There is the possibility that IPG could be taken over by a number of other advertising firms (there have been reports that Publicis Group has been interested).  IPG’s well-established, extensive and reputable portfolio of advertising agencies is a key competitive strength.  Over the past several years, client companies have made greater demands of ad agencies.  Ad firms not only buy media and produce advertising, but they must also provide all-around marketing support for clients.  Due to clients increasingly developing and managing their businesses globally, it has become very important for agencies to build systems that can offer worldwide services in a “one-stop-shop” format that can deal with ad needs across several countries/continents.   Also, advertising clients are increasingly trying to concentrate their ad spending with fewer agencies; by doing so, they are better able to control ad spending by taking advantage of bulk media discounts.  Clients have also focused on ways to improve their own costs by devoting fewer employees to managing external ad agencies; thus clients are doing more business with fewer ad firms and with firms that can provide multiple ad services across the entire advertising chain (from production, media placement, promotion, and global account management).  From the advertising industry perspective, larger ad firms are able to develop economies of scale by offering/cross-selling more services to their clients and by negotiating better discounts with the media firms—it is no coincidence that general smaller ad firms’ margins lower vs. those of largest players, which in contrast have achieved the scale to cross-sell more ad/marketing services and drive more revenues per employee.  Finally, advertising is an intensely competitive business and in the midst of price competition, larger ad firms have the ability to pass on the savings from economies of scale/bulk media discounts onto the client, while offering more value (vs. smaller ad firms) via more service offerings.  As a result of these secular trends, over the past decade there has been a strong desire for ad firms to expand (both in business lines and geographically) and improve their economies of scale by via acquisitions.  Companies such as IPG, OMC, Publicis, and Havas, have been formed through hundreds dozens of acquisitions of smaller ad firms.  Over the past 10 years, these “roll ups” have been conducted at multiples ranging from 10x-20x EBITDA (averaging around 12x-13x, based on last 23 major global ad agency transactions);  the most recent global transaction, Omnicom’s purchase of Grey Global in late 2004, was done at ~10x (Havas also tried to acquire Grey, but lost out to Omnicom).  Publicis Group, in 2005, announced that it was in talks to buy Aegis (trading at 14x EV/EBITDA at the time—although nothing materialized) and currently the largest investor in Aegis (Vincent Ballore who is the Chairman of Havas) is trying to get two seats Board in order to effectuate a merger with Havas.   Asian ad agencies also seen its fair share of rapid consolidation, most recently with the triple merger and subsequent early 2005 IPO) of #2 ranked ad firm Hakuhodo (merged with Yomiko, and Daiko), and Dentsu’s purchase of 50% of a small Japanese ad firm, Meitetsu, from its owner, the Nagoya Railroad (price undisclosed).
  Valuation:  The adjusted EBITDA that would be derived post  the cost cuts over next 2-3 years would be about $830MM, while EBITDA from assumed incremental revenue growth of $500MM ($6.7BN total company revenues) over the next two years would be $170MM, resulting in total EBITDA of approximately $1.0BN--for an EBITDA margin of 15%, in-line with IPG’s peers.
  The table below demonstrates that if IPG is valued to similar levels as peers based on the adjusted financial metrics 2-3 years form now and using multiples of EV/Sales and EV/EBITDA (at peer levels of 1.6x and 10.0x, respectively), this yields a price of between $17.50-$18.70/share on a fully diluted basis.  With the share count, I have assumed that the convertible debt issue (all $800MM can be converted at $12.42/share;  $400MM can put to the company at par after 3/15/2008, the other $400MM at 3/15/2012; or IPG can call $400MM of bonds at par on 9/15/2009 and $400MM on 3/12/2012 for cash) will be converted into equity  (64.4MM dilution potential) as my target price would be far above the conversion prices (and the company can call the bonds at par, which would force conversion).  With regard to the Series A and Series B preferreds, the $347MM Series A have an automatic (mandatory) conversion date of 12/15/2006 (21.1-25.7MM share dilution potential), while the $525MM in Series B perpetual preferred is convertible at holder’s option into 73.1904 shares of common stock (conversion price of $13.66).  The Series B can also be converted at IPG’s option (after 10/15/2010) if the closing price of the stock multiplied by the conversion rate, equals or exceeds 130% of the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share.  If the stock goes above approximately $17.80, and convert holders have not yet chosen to convert, then the Company would likely exercise its conversion option ($17.80 x 73.1904 = 1,300 or 130% of the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share)—this feature would also ‘force’ the preferred holders to convert into common if the stock goes above $17.80.  Assuming full conversion of the notes and the mandatory convertible preferreds, the Company would be in a zero net debt position (currently has $1.5BN in cash vs $2.25BN in debt less 800MM in converts =$1.45BN of adjusted debt).  However, if the Series B preferred holders chose not to convert and the share price would still be below $17.8, there could  be an additional $525MM in front of the common stock, thus I have included this as the net debt position in the calculations below.   Also the calculation excludes the net FCF that would be generated over the next 3 years--Assuming $1+ BN in EBITDA, FCF would be in excess of $400MM per year (there is minimal Capex required in this business).

          If the preferreds are converted, the upside potential would be even greater as the $525MM is removed from the EV calculation, and the equity shares would be issued (fully diluted share count would remain unchanged)
    Risks and Weaknesses:
  If stock price languishes and does not trade up to the conversion prices on the convertible notes and preferreds, there will be more obligations in front of the equity, while fully diluted shares would still remain the same.  Thus, the price of the stock is dependent on the continued success of the turnaround, the optimization of the cost structure, or the company is taken out at a significant premium by another ad agency.
Customer concentration:  IPG has approximately 25% of its revenues tied up in its top ten clients, including GM, Microsoft, Unilever J&J, and VZ.  The loss of the entire business of any one of these clients would likely have a material affect on IPG’s revenues—however it is unlikely that IPG would lose all the business of any one client in one fell swoop.
Loss of key talent:  As departures at Lowe in 2005 demonstrate, the agency business relies heavily on relationships of account managers with their clients.  The ability of other ad agencies to lure away talent could have negative consequences.  However, it appears that turnover should be reduced now that key managers have been hired and the Company has made progress in restoring its reputation and winning new clients.
Liquidity/Balance Sheet constraints:   This was an issue for the Company in 2004-2005 as it had to restate financial results, investors and clients were losing confidence in the company, and financial results suffered.  The company made it through this difficult period by issuing convertible preferreds/notes and IPG suffered an multi-notch downgrade in its debt ratings to Ba3/B (from Baa3/BBB-).  However, these recent financial moves gave the company more than ample liquidity and it currently has $1.5BN on the balance sheet in cash.
Business profile/mix:  Only 37% of IGP’s revenues come from the faster growing (7%-10%) marketing services (i.e. interactive, public relations, experimental marketing, sports marketing, branding, packaging & design).   The top 6 players in the industry on average derive about 45% of their revenue from these services.  While a weakness, this also represents a long-term opportunity for IPG as the Company is focused on closing the gap and offering more services in these higher-growth areas.  Another advantage that IPG has in the traditional advertising business is its higher exposure to fast-growing emerging markets.  About 45% of IPG’s revenues come from abroad, which is in-line with the ad agency industry, but of these revenues, about 17% of it comes from the faster-growing Asia Pacific and Latin American Regions, compares to a 12%-14% exposure for the ad-agency industry).  For example growth in IPG’s Latin American region was is currently in the 7% range.
Loss of WMT account may could have additional fallout depending on the reason for the firing of the WMT execs—it would be negative if allegation of kickbacks or personal relationships among principals start making headlines.   A key part of IPG’s turnaround is putting its reputation issues behind it, however it appears that the problem was related to DraftECB specifically as WMT will allow other IPG agencies to bid for the business.   Moreover, while this was a modest loss, there have been numerous client wins, which will still likely propel organic revenue growth in the 3%-4% range in FY07.
Catalyst
1)Continued elimination of transitional costs from expense structure will dramatically expand EBITDA margins closer to peer levels.

2) A successful turnaround resulting in new client wins and growing organic revenues near 5% would get EBITDA margins to the same level as enjoyed by other ad firms.

3) As the world’s 3rd largest advertising firm, the business would be attractive to another ad agency; the industry continues to consolidate and IPG would be attractive as an acquiring agency given the price (on EV/sales basis) and the strong potential to further squeeze out costs and get margins more in line with those of the acquiring entity.",5.948230907373927,1.4655445735233645,-19.1379519619552,-15.08623625822808,-0.5638903254703336,7.627818878004926,4.43880721515707,-1.714373436770661

___________________________________________________________________
To understand how we manage our company, how we view the current state of the business, and where we are going in the future, it is helpful to remember where we came from. We started the company in 1996 with a $50,000 equity investment. To grow the company, we made the decision to leverage that investment with debt and guarantees – significantly, at certain points – without infusing additional equity into the company until our IPO in 2003.
With a defined set of core values and business principles, and the idea that those concepts would be maintained during all market conditions, we have turned our original investment into $1.88 billion in book value over a 20-year period [emphasis added]. The compounded annual growth rate of our per share book value from 2004 (our first full year as a publicly traded company) to 2015 was 20.0%, compared with 7.4% for the S&P 500 over the same period (with dividends included).

“We’ve all heard the saying that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, but with Nelnet stock, you get two in the hand and two in the bush.”
- Mike Dunlap, Executive Chairman
Overview
Nelnet is a complex company that we believe is deeply misunderstood and undervalued by the market.  On the surface, it appears to be a highly leveraged business in decline.  The company owns a $24B portfolio of federally guaranteed student loans that is match-funded with debt.  However, since 2010, Nelnet and all other private lenders have been unable to issue new federally insured loans, leaving the current portfolio in runoff.  
What the market fails to recognize is that Nelnet has been slowly taking the cash generated by the loan portfolio and transforming itself into a highly profitable and diversified company.  These actions began over a decade ago and have accelerated in recent years.  As a result, it now possesses a number of attractive and growing businesses, all managed by an exceptional operational team, with a history of accretive capital allocation.  We have broken down each major component of Nelnet and believe the company is currently worth at least 50% more than the market price [$40] with a clear path to significantly greater future returns, all coupled with exceptional safety in the form of the federally guaranteed loan portfolio.
Background and Context
In 1996, Mike Dunlap and Stephen Butterfield each invested $25k to form Nelnet.  Over the ensuing seven years, they grew their initial investment into $109M, a return of over 2000x.  This led to Nelnet’s IPO in December of 2003, which raised an additional $168M of equity capital.  Since then, the company has compounded book value per share at 20% per annum to over $2B in aggregate without issuing any additional equity.
Nelnet’s roots lay in education finance and services.  Since its founding, the company has originated and serviced student loans under the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP), whose debts are ultimately guaranteed by the US government.  In 2010, the FFELP was terminated, and private lenders such as Nelnet have since been unable to continue to issue federally guaranteed student loans.  Today, Nelnet holds a $24B portfolio of these legacy loans in runoff, match funded with low-cost debt.  This loan book represents, on an undiscounted basis, $2.02B of future cash flows, with 75% coming in the next six years.  Most importantly, the portfolio is structured so it has virtually no funding risk, and by virtue of the federal guarantee, almost no credit risk.
Nelnet’s ability to compound book value over long periods of time is a tribute to co-founder and Executive Chairman Mike Dunlap.  The most transformative decision he made, more than a decade ago, was to start pursuing recurring fee-generative businesses that complement the student loan portfolio.  At the time, he presciently recognized the political risks inherent to his business, and worked ferociously to diversify away from them.  His investments have resulted in four new business segments that currently account for over $400M of revenue and $80M of EBITDA with tremendous upside potential.
With the student loan book expected to generate $2.02B of cash going forward – greater than the company’s current market cap – one can be comfortable with the downside of an investment in Nelnet.  In order to gain conviction on the upside, one must understand the value of the other business segments, as well as trust that Dunlap will continue to make smart investment decisions.  We will attempt to explain both.
Valuation Approach
The best way to value Nelnet is as a sum of the parts as each of the five segments has unique structures and economics.  We will go through each individually, and then roll them up to obtain an entity-level valuation of what the business is worth today.  From there, we will assign a range of growth rates to provide a 3-year forward value.
Asset Generation & Management
Nelnet holds a $24B portfolio of FFELP loans that are match-funded through a series of asset-based securitizations.  The funding for these assets is non-recourse to the parent company, but must be consolidated for financial reporting purposes, leaving outsiders with the impression that Nelnet is highly leveraged.  The credit loss exposure here is actually minimal due to the government backstop, meaning the $2.02B of future cash flow is effectively guaranteed.  It is worth noting that this number includes some super prime private loans.  However, given the small size and credit profile of these loans, they do not impact the broader story.
Nelnet not only has a financial interest in their portfolio, but also services the loans through a complimentary business line (which we will discuss later).  As a scale provider in these two verticals, Nelnet is able to acquire the residual loans of other subscale competitors whose portfolios are also in runoff.  Historically, Nelnet has been able to stem the decline of their book through these acquisitions, and with the exception of last year, has acquired $3-4B of loan assets annually.  This is illustrated by the fact that, in 2012, Nelnet predicted their portfolio of $24.8B would generate $1.97B in undiscounted future cash flow.  Five years later, the company has acquired enough loans so that these numbers are effectively unchanged.  
Nelnet publishes an updated table each quarter showing the expected future cash flows of their portfolio.  These numbers are prepared by management, and while somewhat subjective, they do take into account the latest information on interest rates and prepayment activity.  Management has historically been very conservative with their projections and we have included the current table below along with the NPV at a range of discount rates.
We believe the most appropriate discount rate for these cash flows is 2.5%, slightly above the current yield on the 10-Year Bond, as Nelnet’s loan portfolio has credit profile similar to the 10-Year.  The reason we chose to use such a low discount rate is that we are shorting a corresponding basket of US treasuries with similar duration, and this represents our cost of capital on this segment.  If we were not doing this, then we would use a markedly higher rate of closer to 10%.  Of the $2.02B of cash flows, approximately $775M will represent a return of capital, while the remaining will be subject to taxes.  We have tax affected our numbers assuming a ratable distribution of the $775M and a tax rate of 35%.
                                                                                             Source: NNI Q1 2017 10-Q
  There are three factors that could cause the value of this segment to be impaired.  The first would be a significant rise in rates.  On the surface, this would be detrimental as Nelnet largely borrows at a variable market rate and the student debt is locked into interest rate floors.  Significant and sustained rate growth would then shrink the spread Nelnet makes, decreasing the value of future cash flows.  That said, we believe this is a lesser concern than it appears since a majority of the cash comes in the next five years and Nelnet has notional hedges on $6.5B of debt in place that is termed out over the next 7+ years.  A rapid rise in rates would certainly hurt long-term value, but does not present a terminal risk.  In fact, in the short-term a big spike in rates would actually be cash flow positive given the hedges.  
The second is similar to the interest rate risk in that there is also some level of basis risk.  Nelnet funds loans with 1-Month LIBOR and receives 3-Month LIBOR.  In management’s cash flow projections, they assume a spread of 12 bps between the rates during the life of the loans.  However, if this spread widens dramatically for a sustained period of time, the cash flows would decrease.  Again, the company has entered into hedges that severely limit the prospect of any terminal impairment.  It is important to note that during the 2008 crisis this spread did widen, and as recently as this quarter temporally reached 30 bps.  However, measured over long periods of time, the 12 bps spread has been accurate.  Per the most recent 10-Q, if the forecast is computed assuming a spread of 24 bps (double the current assumption) for the life of the portfolio, the cash flow forecast would be reduced by $85-125M, or roughly 5%.  In other words, a sustained widening of the spread would hurt a little, but is not an existential threat to the company.  
Lastly, there exists the risk of a legislative change that would allow or incent borrowers to consolidate (e.g. refinance).  This outcome (prepayment) would greatly reduce the value of the loan book, but we view it as very unlikely, and again is mitigated by the relatively rapid amortization of the loans.
Nelnet Diversified Solutions (Loan Servicing)
Nelnet has historically serviced FFELP and private loans, which has been the largest revenue source for the company outside of the loan portfolio.  In 2009, the Department of Education decided to outsource the servicing of all loans issued through the Federal Direct Student Loan Program, the largest pool of government student loans.  Nelnet was one of four private sector companies selected to be Title IV Additional Servicers (TIVAS).  Today, Nelnet services $194.8B of FFELP, private and government loans for 7.64M borrowers, generating over $260M of revenue.   
With the TIVAS contract set to expire in 2019, the Department of Education has decided to select a single servicing platform and fewer servicers in an effort to simplify and lower costs.  Nelnet, sensing the all-or-nothing nature of the RFP process, has partnered with Great Lakes, another TIVAS servicer.  Nelent and Great Lakes have created a 50-50 joint venture, GreatNet, that will compete for the contract.  While the economics would be split under the JV, the chances of being selected are greatly enhanced and the total economics would likely more than double.  GreatNet was recently selected as one of three parties to move on to Phase II of the process, along with Navient and PHEAA.   
While the RFP process was initiated under the Obama administration, Betsy DeVos has indicated that she may want to take a new approach to servicing.  DeVos seems to be proposing not only a single platform for servicing, but also a single servicer.  Furthermore, her commentary and guidance have indicated that she might depart from the selection criteria espoused under the prior administration. Based on her comments, this will represent one of the largest non-military contracts ever awarded by the federal government.  
In our view, there are three potential outcomes.  The first is that GreatNet does not win the contract, in which case Nelnet will continue servicing federal loans through 2019 and begin transitioning their government loans to another provider.  They will continue servicing their private loans, which account for 4% of the current book, as well as the legacy FFELP loans.  The second is that GreatNet wins, which would be a massive boost to Nelnet and guarantee a huge future earnings stream.  The third is that the process drags on for a number of years and the status quo extends beyond 2019, which is quite likely given the new set of requirements.  We have done our best to handicap the outcome, and believe GreatNet has a greater than 50% chance of winning.  That said, the Department of Education remains the greatest uncertainty for Nelnet going forward.
In our analysis, we have created three cases.  The low case assumes they lose the contract in two years, for which we have valued the business at 3x 2016 EBITDA of $63.3M.  This assumes two more years of servicing government loans, a transition period to another servicer, and the cash generated from continuing to service private loans.  The base case assumes this process drags out and volumes are unchanged.  We assign the servicing business an 8x EBITDA multiple under this scenario.  In the high case, we assume GreatNet wins the government contract and volumes increase significantly.  We assigned this scenario a 12x multiple of 2016 EBITDA. [Nelnet has since acquired Great Lakes outright -more in the message string on this]
Nelnet Business Solutions (Education Commerce & Payment Processing)
Nelnet’s education commerce and payment processing segment is comprised of a number of businesses, two of which serve private, faith-based K-12 schools in the US and Australia.  FACTS, acquired in 2005, provides payment solutions that enable schools to bill and collect tuition payments in a manner that is efficient and convenient for all parties.  FACTS is the market leader in actively managed tuition payment plans, serving over 13,500 schools, and has built a strong moat in this vertical.  That moat was widened by the 2014 purchase of RenWeb, a tool that allows schools to automate administrative processes such as admissions, billing, attendance, class scheduling, grade reporting and the like.  The businesses are extremely complimentary and the RenWeb acquisition has led to great cross-selling opportunities as the products have been integrated into a single cloud-based platform.  The offerings were recently expanded to Australia and Nelnet has been encouraged by the early feedback and results.
Nelnet Campus Commerce (NCC) is, like FACTS, focused on tuition payment plans, but for higher education institutions.  NCC earns fees by administering actively managed payment plans that allow students and families to make monthly tuition payments.  They also work to facilitate on-campus transactions such as parking and meals that tie back to the college’s accounting system.  NCC works with 970 higher education institutions worldwide, serving over 7M student and families.
When Nelnet acquired FACTS in 2005, it was producing $24M of revenue.  Over the last decade, they have grown that number to $120M and continue to see ample growth opportunities ahead.  Additionally, the payment and transaction processing space has been red hot of late, with takeout multiples consistently in the 20-35x EBITDA range.  This is for good reason.  These businesses are capital efficient, have great margins, and enjoy mostly recurring revenue.  Specific to Nelnet, management has consistently stated they believe this will be a big area of future growth.  In our valuation, we used a multiple range of 10-20x 2016 EBITDA of $45.3M to value this segment.
Telecommunications (ALLO)
In 2016, Nelnet acquired a 91.5% stake in ALLO Communications, a Nebraska-based telecom company, for $46M, with ALLO management retaining the rest.  What made this purchase so significant is that it represented Nelnet’s first meaningful departure from its educational roots.  Pre-2010, when the company was able to issue FFELP loans, we don’t believe Nelnet would have considered a transaction such as ALLO.  However, with the loan book in runoff, the ALLO purchase demonstrated that Nelnet is simply focused on making high-return investments, even if that means entering new markets.
ALLO offers fiber-optic service to homes and residences, specializing in ultra-fast internet that is not offered by competitors.  It originated in Western Nebraska and was focused locally until being acquired by Nelnet.  Now, they have begun a multi-year program to pass all homes and businesses in Nelnet’s hometown of Lincoln and potentially beyond.  
The logic behind the purchase was that ALLO is a capital-intensive business that lacked a deep pool of capital, and Nelnet is a non-capital-intensive business with a significant pool of capital.  With management committed to making investments that generate returns in the teens or above, ALLO clearly fit the criteria and will be a big source of investment going forward.  This is illustrated by the $39M of investment in laying fiber during 2016 and an additional $80M expected in 2017.
To date, management has indicated they are pleased with the performance of the investment, and the thesis is playing out as expected.  We believe that over time, this business will absorb significant capital as fiber assets are deployed, and will begin to cash flow over the ensuing years.  From a financial perspective, fiber looks a great deal like real estate in that it is cash consumptive during construction, and then can be leveraged upon stabilization.  Management has gone as far as to indicate that earnings will be depressed through 2018 as they wait for the investments to mature.  
For now, given that the investment is performing within expectations and lacks normalized earnings, we believe using book value is appropriate.  Our valuation model ranges from using 1x book on the low end to 2x book on the high side.  We calculate current book value to be $97M, representing Nelnet’s $46M purchase price plus a 91.5% stake in the $55.7M of fiber investments through Q1 2017.
Corporate & Other
The final of the five segments is effectively a catch-all for a number of ancillary businesses as well as unallocated corporate overhead.  The two most notable businesses here are Peterson’s, which provides prep services for standardized tests, and Whitetail Rock Capital Management, an investment advisor with about $1B under management.
With the negative earnings stemming from the allocation of corporate expenses, we view this segment as effectively being the overhead that supports the other businesses.  In our valuation, we have tried to normalize for one-time gains and losses in the operating businesses to reach a more accurate number.  Please note that this segment’s numbers do not represent corporate overhead in isolation, but rather expenses net of some smaller earnings streams.  We have used a range of 8-12x 2016 EBITDA of -21.1M to value to segment.
Hudl
While Hudl does not fall under any of the five segments, it is worth discussing since it represents a significant piece of Nelnet’s value.  Hudl is a cloud-based software company that allows coaches and athletes to edit and share video, study associated play diagrams, and create quality highlight reels for entertainment, coaching and recruiting purposes.  It was founded in 2006, and Nelnet has been a small equity investor from the beginning.  Since then, Hudl has become the preferred game film solution for teams from the smallest youth organizations to professional franchises.  In total, it now has nearly 5.5M unique users and 150k active teams including 29 NBA teams, FC Barcelona and the New Zealand All Blacks.
In 2014, Lincoln-based Hudl was listed in the Inc. 5000 as the 269th fastest growing private company in America and carried that momentum to a $72.5M Series B in 2015 led by Accel Partners that valued the company at $250M.  Nelnet added to their seed investment with $40.5M participation in the round, bringing their ownership to 18.6% of the company. 
In terms of valuing Nelnet’s stake in Hudl, we view the baseline as $46.5M, or Nelnet’s 18.6% of the $250M valuation in 2015.  [They have since raised another round - update to follow]. Given the company has made a number of bolt-on acquisitions and grown its userbase by over 50% since that time, we estimate the value of the investment has roughly doubled to $93M.  We firmly believe that if Hudl sustains its current growth trajectory, the entire business could be worth $1B to strategic buyers such as Nike, ESPN, Amazon and Google within 5 years.  While Hudl’s value isn’t as material as any of the standalone segments, it is indicative of the potential upside that is latent within Nelnet and to which we have ascribed no value.

Other Valuation Considerations
Given the complex structure of Nelnet, we have combed through the balance sheet to identify cash or debt of the parent company that would affect our valuation.  For assets, we determined that there is $418.5M of cash & investments in excess of the working capital needs of the various segments.  This consists of cash on the balance sheet, investments & notes receivable, and $77.9M of equity in the warehouse facilities.  We backed out the $41.5M investment in Hudl from investments since we value that separately.  For liabilities, we isolated $76.4M of debt that is recourse to the company.  That consists of $50.2M of unsecured debt and $18.3M of other borrowings.
Valuation Summary
To create a valuation range for Nelnet, we look at each key segment on a low, base and high case as described above.  The valuation is the most sensitive to the loan servicing business, which makes sense given the uncertainty surrounding the federal contract.  Each investor can select a set of assumptions that fits their outlook.  We have chosen the base case for each segment besides asset generation.  For that, we have taken the high case of a 2.5% discount rate due to our interest rate hedges.  This provides us with a net valuation of $74 a share, 64% higher than the current price.
The table above shows what we believe the company is worth today.  Integral to the Nelnet investment thesis is that the company will be able to compound value by reinvesting the substantial cash proceeds of the loan book into new loan purchases, buybacks, ALLO and the like.  In order to account for this, we have assumed that Nelnet grows value per share at between 10-20% annually over the next three years.  The table below provides our estimates of future value (2020) based on this range of growth rates.
  Capital Allocation
The single most important factor that will determine the success of an investment in Nelnet is Mike Dunlap’s capital allocation acumen.  Most of the operating segments are capital light, growing and generating meaningful cash.  In particular, the student loan book will produce $1.4B of cash in the next six years, with decreasing reinvestment opportunity into new loans.  We believe this dynamic is what led to the purchase of ALLO, where significant capital can be deployed at attractive returns.  In our view, ALLO is to Nelnet what railroads were to Berkshire - it absorbs lots of capital while providing attractive returns.
We take comfort in the fact that Mike Dunlap is leading the capital allocation efforts.  He co-founded the company with $50k, has only done one equity raise, has compounded book value at 20% since, and owns over 20% of the company.  In 2013, he stepped down as CEO to take a role as Executive Chairman to focus primarily on how to invest the cash generated by the loan book.  
He has also shown a propensity to return capital to shareholders when appropriate.  Nelnet has repurchased over 25% of its shares since 2006, instituted a dividend in 2007, and has opportunistically retired its debt.  There is a buyback in place and the current dividend yield is 1.2%.  We believe Nelnet will continue to repurchase stock going forward and this will be a real source of value.  Lastly, Nelnet is uniquely transparent with their capital allocation and the company’s recent shareholder letters (which are Exhibits A & B and we strongly recommend reading) include tables such as those below that give you a deep understanding of their thinking and performance.

Risks
We have identified three key risks that would impair the future value of Nelnet.  The first is losing the government loan servicing contract.  While we believe there is a less than 50% chance of this happening, it would result in the loss of a majority of a business that generated over $60M of EBITDA in 2016.  Even if this were to occur, our valuation points to Nelnet still being an attractive investment.  The second risk is poor capital allocation.  With the company now expanding into non-education businesses, it is possible that capital is reinvested in subpar opportunities.  After reading every shareholder letter (again, we strongly recommend this), we have become more comfortable that Dunlap is uniquely skilled in this area and his track record is not a fluke.  Lastly, there is a small risk that legislative action could reduce the value of the loan book by incentivizing pre-payments. We view this as highly unlikely.
We also came across a short thesis by Pine Capital Partners from a couple of years ago that raises three reasonable concerns about Nelnet’s business model.  The first is that the spread Nelnet earns on its loan book has been inflated by low rates.  While that is true, three quarters of the cash comes back during the next six years, during which rates should continue to be low, not to mention the risk is hedged.  The second is that income-based prepayment plans will lead to markedly slower cash collection going forward.  This is also true, but that does not concern us given the federal guarantee of the payments. The third risk they highlight is the potential loss of the government servicing contract, which we have already discussed at length.  While we do think these risks are overstated, we recommend reading the write-up here: http://bit.ly/2toDDee

Summary
Nelnet possesses many of the traits we seek in an ideal investment.  It is run by an owner-operator, is conservatively financed and has an asymmetric return profile.  Further, we can understand why the mispricing might exist as it screens as a highly leveraged entity with declining earnings and a key contract exposed to a fickle government process.  We believe elements of Nelnet are highly uncertain, but a careful analysis demonstrates that even under the most adverse circumstances, Nelnet is a great business that can be purchased at a bargain price.

ARC Document Solutions is a managed print services provider in the construction and engineering space with high market share, pro-cyclical economics, macro headwinds, and trades at a pre-COVID FCF yield to equity of 25% and a pre-COVID FCF to enterprise value of 16%. The company has built a track record in the last several years of accruing value to shareholders despite a continued shift to digitization in the Architectural, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. Because of large financing leases on large scale printers, the stock doesn’t screen well and it can be tricky to parse out the true economics of the business. In a normalized environment, I think they can get back to GDPish growth over a full cycle on the top line, 
I won’t get into a lengthy discussion on business segments, as there are other articles on the site that have done so and the presentation hasn’t changed much in the last 5-6 years, but a quick refresher: 
CDIM--Construction Document and Information Management (63% of gross profit)
This segment is the scary cyclical one. Revenues primarily come from AEC printing jobs that are sent to ARC’s physical service locations, so revenues are very dependent on construction activity. They also print signage instead of just traditional reprographics (building drawings), and 10% of the revenues here come from software related services.
MPS--Managed Print Services (29% of gross profit)
ARC will typically sign a 3-4 year agreement with an AEC firm to manage their on-premise printing needs. Since they have years of experience as the number one player in reprographics, they’ve build software that tailors to the needs of AEC firms, so while they do compete with printer OEMs for MPS revenue, they have better capability to service their niche. To acquire the printers for these contracts, they will either purchase the printer themselves up front, or they will lease the printer over a timeframe that matches up with the life of the contract. (This is why I like to deduct the new finance leases each year like capex, and it’s also why I think the business is significantly less capital intensive than it may look like at a glance from the balance sheet--they take on the leases when they have a contract in place.) In 2014-15 this part of the business began to show decent growth, as investors hoped that the company could offset less printing by offering more recurring revenue with added software capabilities. That really hasn’t played out, as the segment has declined at a low single digits clip for the last several years. 
AIM--Archiving and Information Management (4% of gross profit)
ARC, in addition to managing your print needs, will also provide archival services to AEC firms for their old drawings, and they will store them in the cloud through their SKYSITE software program. This part of the business is small, but has grown mid-single digits since 2013. 
E&S--Equipment and Supplies (4% of gross profit)
This is low margin, tangential revenue that comes from reselling printers to their customers, nothing to be excited about.
Management
For a $35 mil market cap company, this isn’t your typical hype-cycle co. where every incremental dollar generated gets transferred into the pockets of management. They are not frequenters on the sell-side conference circuit, and analysts have abandoned the name because ARC hasn’t raised equity capital since 2007. Suri, the CEO and co-founder, owns 11% of the outstanding and has reasonable comp at about $1.7 mil in 2019. In response to the COVID situation, he’s taken a 50% salary reduction. While I wouldn’t describe the operational results as exceptional over the years, they have paid down an average of $22 mil in long-term debt per year since 2013, bringing the year end 2019 number to $43 mil from $177 mil in 2013. (In the 1st quarter, though, much like many other companies with the ability to do so they did draw down their revolver in response to COVID, which brought their March 31 long-term debt to approximately $58 million as of 3/31/20.) The company has simultaneously been buying back stock--diluted shares outstanding peaked at about 47.5 million at the end of 2015 and sit at roughly 43.8 million today. 
Capital Lease Treatment
Some of the confusion and hesitancy on the part of investors comes from ARC’s capital lease liabilities. ARC uses capital leases to finance large scale printers that they use predominantly in their MPS business, and these lease terms and depreciation schedules largely match the life of the customers they serve.
My preferred treatment of the economics is to look at the FCF to the firm and deduct the annual lease payments as an expense. Since the company lumps debt paydown and lease paydown together on the cash flow statement, it can take some cross-referencing to figure out what went where. As a quick proxy, I’ve found that since ARC’s capital spending is basically all maintenance capex, I use depreciation and amortization (which includes the depreciation from the lease assets) as cash expense to deduct from cash from ops (which has the interest part of the lease already taken out). Deducting stock-based comp and adjusting for changes in non-cash working capital as well, I get about $8.7 million in adjusted FCF for 2019, a 25% yield on the current market cap. Treating it this way, the true enterprise value currently sits at $55 mil ($35 mil market cap + $58 mil LT Debt - $38 mil cash as of 3/31/20). EBITDA numbers, though, in this treatment are basically useless.
ARC has been deemed an essential business during COVID, and therefore has been allowed to be open for the most part this year. Revenues were down 9% yoy in the first quarter, and they have reduced workforce by 30%, have been granted rent deferral in 60% of their locations, and cut back on capex. I expect them not to burn much if any cash over the next several quarters, as the cost structure is pretty variable--they managed to stay cash flow positive post-GFC despite revenues declining 42% peak to trough. It may take a year or two, but I expect ARC to get back to their steady-state revenues in the $400 mil range with between $8-15 mil of adjusted FCF on an enterprise value of $55 million.
For a misunderstood, (now) penny stock, underfollowed, capital light, high ROIC business, trading at by far a record low EV/Sales (0.14x by my math), even without much in the way of growth prospects, I think equity holders will get paid well owning ARC in any non-bankruptcy scenario.

Thesis Brief:
I'm going to include a team member's more traditionally and dryly prepared bullet-point write-up below, but to just package the punchline more neatly, and maybe save some ammo for the message boards if folks wanna throw stones:
Our thesis case is that DXLG generates just under $1 in FCF p/ share this year; the stock is at $1.20. We'll paint our base or conservative case of $.85 of FCF p/ share below, but either way, there aren't a ton of palpable, possible 10-baggers left out there, so anybody with a reasonable illiquidity tolerance is gonna have to take a shot here. Over the last couple months, top line trends have inflected dramatically, or so say an amalgamation of direct store checks spanning over a dozen states, primary research in collaboration with two former C-suite executives and the former head of real estate, and high-correlated alternative data. But the flow through is going to be even better, aided by recently abated rent structures in physical stores, web scraping based indications of a materially less promotional environment, and structural SG&A cuts. As another reference point relative to our FCF p/ share estimates, management recently guided to mid-teens millions of EBITDA for this fiscal year. It's hard for us to see them doing less than 60; the enterprise value is 130.
  Like with the move in KIRK from a dollar to 20, or CTRN from 7 to 70, if we're right, pundits will conjure up all sorts of expressions for why this is a 25 dollar stock when it's at 10-12. To be sure, they'll be reasonable academic arguments posed mostly to backfill an explanation for what has already occurred, almost as an ode to market reflexivity and the notion that people want to put a messy world into intelligible order. To us, it's more about the initial post-inflection price discovery that takes place when it becomes clear that this company might be able to buy down it's entire equity value with the cash it generates in little more than one year. We're seeing once-in-a-century shifts in consumer behavior, and these shifts have tails to them, especially when a given business is dramatically better positioned structurally and the entire big and tall world just got bigger and taller (or at least bigger), all while the many occasions they didn't dress up for in 2020 will come back and then some this year and next, and a heck of a lot of the country has a wad of cash burning a hole in its pocket. Yet even beyond the reopening renaissance period, this is a niche business with characteristics that should lead investors to capitalize the earnings power we expect it will imminently reveal. We think the path to $7-8 bucks p/ share, 5x plus, is within reach by this fall. 
Business Description / Background
Destination XL (DXLG) is the largest specialty retailer of big & tall men’s clothing and shoes. The company operates 311 stores under the Destination XL and Casual Male XL banners.
Overview
3 straightforward points
-        DXLG is an underappreciated reopening beneficiary
-        Company-specific initiatives will drive material uplift to top line growth and long-term profitability
-        Current valuation reflects material disconnect from the company’s underlying fundamentals
-        Our work suggests business trends have accelerated meaningfully into 1Q, with sales in-line or above 1Q19 levels. This, in tandem with the three aforementioned points, gets us to FY2021 revenue of $480mm (vs. guidance of $385-$402mm). Layering on +400 bps of merchandise margin expansion (due to reduced promotionality) and the associated occupancy leverage drives our FY21 gross margin +150 bps above FY19 levels. Finally, after adjusting the company’s cost base for the structural cost take-out they have achieved, we arrive at the company generating $45mm of FCF ($0.85/share). Assuming an 8-10x FCF multiple implies a target price between $7-$8.50 (+467% to +580% upside).
Underappreciated long-term Covid beneficiary
-          Uniquely positioned - DXLG’s is uniquely positioned and will benefit disproportionately relative to its retail peers
-          The company operates as the largest player in a niche market (big & tall) with favorable competitive dynamics relative to other retailers
-          Greater need for in-person fitting creates natural friction to e-commerce competition
-          “[the] customer wants to come in and see how things fit, not the typical shopper” – former Director of CRM
-          A “captive” customer base given limited alternatives within an already underserved segment of the market
-          Advantageous store footprint – positioned almost exclusively off-mall, allowing for a faster rebound once restrictions are loosened / overall consumer mobility increases
-          Pent up demand - demand from existing customer base to be magnified as customers need to replenish/replace their wardrobe due to weight fluctuations
-          Expanded core customer demographic - Anticipate step-function increase in the company’s core customer demographic / overall sales base post-Covid
-           COVID has driven an increase in obesity which has been well documented in numerous studies (JAMA – Journal of the American Medical Association, the American Heart Association, and the Mayo Clinic have all published on the subject)
-          For example, one study published in JAMA suggests the average American gained 7.08 lb.
  -          Unlike other retailers, DXLG benefits from a “captive” customer due to limited alternatives, enabling them to capture a significant portion of any incremental demand
Meaningful top-line growth and operating leverage as sales rebound
●        The Company is executing on multiple company-specific initiatives to improve long-term profitability as sales come back faster than the market appreciates
○        Aggressive top-line rebound
■        Highly predictive credit card panels (96.6% correlation) are indicating +30% growth Y/Y in 1Q (QTD), which when making certain assumptions when extrapolating the trend, should correspond to growth of +69% Y/Y in 1Q (or roughly 86% of 2019 sales)
■        Dozens of channel checks across multiple geographies at the store level suggest accelerating sales from 4Q to 1Q, reaching sales volumes in-line or above 1Q19 levels – (“have been crushing 2019 comps since the 2nd week of March and there is no sign of it letting up” – store check)
●        “everyone is similar, getting to even or up” – store check (in reference to 1Q trends vs. 2019)
●        “everyday [we] are consistently beating goals” – store check
■        Other independent channel checks/primary research (incl. working with the company’s former Chief Digital Officer) implies systemwide sales significantly ahead of plan and e-commerce sales of 30%+ Y/Y
○         Long-term margin expansion
■        The company reduced operating expenses by $52mm as part of its effort to rationalize its cost structure throughout FY2020
●        We estimate approximately 50% of the cost take-out is structural and will not return as top line recovers, driving meaningfully improved incremental margins
■        Consistent with the retail space broadly, and per our day-by-day analysis of historical promotions, the company has substantially dialed back its promotionality vs. both 2020 and 2019 levels, which will lead to substantial merchandise margin expansion sequentially
■        The Company has eliminated 29% of its corporate headcount
Current valuation ascribes minimal value to the business
●        We see a reasonable path to DXLG generating $0.85/share of FCF (approx. 65% of current market cap)
●        The company operates under two segments: 1) In-Store and 2) Direct
○        In-Store revenue declined 49% in FY2020, while Direct grew +15%
○        DXLG provided FY2021 revenue guide of $385-$402mm (-15% to -19% Y/Y)
○        On a per store basis, DXLG ended 2020 with In-Store sales at approx. 63% of 2019 levels
○        Our work (As per above) suggests sales have accelerated in 1Q to approx. 80%, with recent weeks trending in-line with 2019 levels
○        As we continue to reopen, we expect sales to trend modestly above 2019 levels (due to reasons outlined above), resulting in FY2021 In-Store sales per store reaching 99% of 2019 levels
○        Layering in a modest +11% Y/Y growth for Direct (within guidance), equates to revenue of $480mm (vs. guidance of $385-$402mm)
○        This corresponds to $45mm of FCF
○        Assuming an 8-10x FCF multiple equates to equity value per share between $7-$8.50 (+467% to +580% upside)
Risks
-          COVID
-          Restrictions stay in place longer than expected
-          Permanent shift in consumer behavior - company loses customers to e-comm channel

Two Little Piggies: If you remember the story of three little pigs, this is not it. Instead, this is the story of two little piggies, a.k.a., thrifts or savings & loans.
Ramblings: Before I proceed further, I will provide some background that led me to this pair of piggies. (If not interested, skip to the “Shale” section.) Most of my investments are in financials but I have become less bullish on the sector over the past six months. To be honest, I am not into macro economics or investing but the current low interest rate environment is starting to have a negative impact and there is no relief in sight. Uncle Ben is saying rates stay low through 2013 and my guess is that it will continue well beyond that time. The Fed is worried more about deflation, particularly in the capital markets, than inflation due to having over stimulated the economy for three decades with leverage. The reversion to the mean can be very mean on demand.
Not here to pitch a tent for Occupy Wall Street but I am trying to put the last thirty years into context. Saying things will return to normal is a relative question, as you need to have a basis for what normal is. In summing up the Greenspan/Bernanke era, all I can think of is the dialogue in “Young Frankenstein” as to whose brain Igor got: Abby Someone. Abby Who? Abby Normal. Since 1980, the US Federal debt has grown at an annual percentage rate of 9.28%. This graph captures it:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Components-of-total-US-debt.jpg
Corporate America is not banking on growth and is thus returning capital back to shareholders via buybacks and dividends. Yet, it continues to maintain lean expenses. Real wages appear stagnant and unemployment remains elevated. The result is an American stand-off – companies are reluctant to hire and consumers are reluctant to spend. That does not even factor in what happens to government demand, where the most optimistic view at this time is it stays flat.
I have some company in this train of thought; please see the GMO Quarterly Letter for December 2011 by Jeremy Grantham (note the paragraph “No Market for Young Men”):
http://www.gmo.com/websitecontent/JGLetter_ShortestLetterEver_3Q11.pdf
In banking, the spreads are likely to contract slowly over time. While the low interest rates have helped the banks by providing cheap funding on the liability side of the balance sheet, the challenge is on the asset side. Directly and indirectly, banks have had to deleverage, whether for Basel III or by regulators. As loans and securities have matured, the banks have had to accept lower yields on reinvestment opportunities. Loan rates are so low that banks are unable or unwilling, depending on one’s perspective, to redeploy capital into loans. Many banks are seeing their loan portfolios shrink, particularly those who are busy writing off real estate related loans. According to BankRegData.com, net loans to total assets over the past 36 months has shrunk from a period high of 55.79% to the current low of 51.70% in 3rd Qtr 2011. Lack of growth leaves two attractions for bank investors – dividend yield and discount to TBV.
Now let me introduce my friend, Bob, who lives up in Wyoming County in Pennsylvania. For the past two years, Bob has seen the Marcellus shale gas boom up close in his small town. For him, it has been the degradation in the quality of life issues. The local Wal-Mart store is being replaced by a Super Wal-Mart. Two new motels have been built that cater to temporary workers. The bars are crowded, as are the newly widened state roads that carry water trucks, tree trimmers (who make more money from the shalers than working for CL&P) and heavy equipment. School enrollment is up, too. Light bulb goes off! Yes, Virginia, there is growth out there; you just have to find out where it is.
Shale: The task became to identify all the small banks with most of their business in the shale regions of Pennsylvania. I started with a map of the Marcellus shale:
http://geology.com/articles/marcellus/marcellus-net-feet-organic-rich-shale.gif
Some friends of mine mentioned another bank just over the border in Ohio that might benefit from the Utica shale field. I looked through the Ohio banks but there are not many with a focus in the eastern part of the state. It is interesting to look at the Utica formation (map is about 60% down the page):
http://geology.com/articles/utica-shale/
When you look at where the Marcellus and the Utica overlap and the respective thickness, one can see where long-term gas will be developed. You can get a quick sense just from reading the news headlines in the green box here:
http://www.co.westmoreland.pa.us/westmoreland/cwp/view.asp?a=1432&q=628365
Or look at p.14 of this 2010 presentation that highlights the benefit of being in the middle of the Marcellus shale field:
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1486058/000119312510148663/dfwp.htm
You can also see the impact from the Bureau of Labor Statistics state map for Pennsylvania:
 http://data.bls.gov/map/MapToolServlet?survey=la&map=county&seasonal=u
 (Note: You will have to select “Pennsylvania” and click on “Draw Map” button.)
With that as my basis, I identified 9 banks in PA and one in OH. I then collected some basic information on the 10 banks and used that for the start of my research. It is in this spreadsheet:
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/29412129/PA%20Banks.xls
From that, I narrowed the focus to those trading below tangible book value. Since some of the banks had significant All Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) amounts, I excluded it from TBV to be more conservative. I then narrowed it further by focusing on the two with the highest capital levels, i.e., tangible equity to tangible assets (TE/TA). What can I say, I am a value investor.
Of course, if I had subscribed to Grant’s Interest Rate Observer, I would have read all about this in its October 29, 2010 edition, as further highlighted by Jim McTague in the November 6, 2010 edition of Barron’s. Oh, well, the mental exercise was good and coming to the same conclusion seemingly validates my analysis.
FFCO Summary: FedFirst is a tiny, $41 million market cap bank tucked in the southwest corner of Pennsylvania. It trades at 70% of tangible book value (TBV), non-performing loans (NPL) are very manageable at 1.01% with 126% allowance for loan loss (ALL) coverage. The bank has $346 million in assets and 9 branches.
History: The bank was founded in 1922 as the Monessen Home Building and Loan Association. In 1940, it converted to a federal savings & loan charter. It changed its name to First Federal Savings Bank and converted to a non-stock mutual holding company (MHC) in 1999. This allowed them to purchase an 80% stake in an insurance agency, Exchange Underwriters, in 2002. In 2005, the MHC sold 3.0 million shares to the public, resulting in net proceeds of $28.7 million. This represented 45% of the outstanding stock, while the MHC retained 55%. The decision to 2nd step in 2010 was accelerated by the demise of their regulator, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). Unfortunately, the initial attempt did not fly, so a second, and lower, appraisal was made that was completed. 2nd step gross proceeds were $17.2 million, net $15.4 million.
Loans: FFCO still has significant amount of residential mortgages on the books, representing 54% of the loan portfolio. One knock is that 12% of the residential mortgages were purchased and that is where most of their problems loans have been. Good news/bad news, is that about half of non-accrual loans by value stem from one relationship. The bank no longer purchases loans, which had been done under previous management prior to 2005. Other that, construction loans are small and HELOC’s well managed.
Other Assets: FedFirst has a high percentage of assets in loans, so investment portfolio is mainly mortgage backed securities (MBS) and real estate mortgage investment conduits (REMIC’s). FFCO is showing a $2.6 million unrealized loss on two pools of insurance company preferred trust obligations. Many small banks bought these in the past decade and FedFirst was fortunate not to have over indulged, The CEO has indicated that given where the yield curve is today, buying securities for short-term benefit is not prudent if interest rates were to rise. While total assets have been flat, the bank has been growing the loan portfolio while shrinking the investment securities.
Management: The Chairman of the Board, John LaCarte, is relatively young at 45 years old and has an interesting background. He worked at PNC for 3 years before leaving to run the family dry cleaning business. He expanded the business to include work uniform sales and sits on the board of a mutual insurer for dry cleaners. Not surprisingly, he wants to expand, which may explain recent turnover in CEO’s and the decision to tap former PNC executives. Given the small market cap size, management is responsive to investor inquiries.
SC 13 Filers: Stilwell owns 9.7% and filed a 13D, while two noted 13G filings came from Third Avenue (7.0%) and Wellington (5.2%). Stilwell has filed a number of 13D’s on thrifts that have gone through mutual conversions (standards, MHC’s, 2nd steps). I do not know anything about Stilwell but you can see how his firm uses the liquidity provided by a conversion to acquire sizable stakes in what become illiquid stocks. Not likely that such a position can be easily sold without causing the stock to plummet.
Earnings: This is obviously the biggest knock against FFCO. If the bank can grow assets to $550 million and earn a return on assets (ROA) of 0.9%, net income would be $5.0 million or $1.67/sh. With a 12 P/E multiple, that equates to a $20 stock price. And maybe there is a Santa Claus. The story here is more about pulling capital levers, being a merger possibility and trading at a 30% discount to TBV. In September 2011, the bank announced a 5% buyback of stock, almost exactly a year after completing its 2nd step. Converted banks cannot do a buyback within a year of conversion without regulator approval.
Risks:
- The bank has only recently started earning money consistently, albeit anemically
- Management starts empire building
- Economic benefits of shale gas drilling do not trickle down to the local area
- Loan book deteriorates
- Fracking becomes an environmental nightmare
Catalyst
Tangible Equity to Tangible Assets is very healthy at 17.1% as the result of the 2nd step. There are two ways to view that: 1) FFCO is over-capitalized or 2) FFCO’s balance sheet is underutilized. The solution to #1 is stock buybacks, which is likely what Stilwell is expressing to management. Personally, it is an odd situation if you look at from a capital allocation perspective. In the worst light, it is a self-funded Ponzi scheme where shareholders buy stock with an expectation of the company buying it back at a higher price. However, it generally works; case in point is ORIT.",0.0,0.0,3.174600171093715,-1.5873000855468575,13.570445866887997,8.336419592220464,13.878989805019899,29.905740441530064

Investment summary
eClerx Services is a mid-cap ($220mm market cap) Indian company that evokes a ""ick"" reaction from investors in India. It is a hated stock, falling nearly 60%+ this year and over 74% over the last 3 years.
At current stock price of INR 425, the stock is at nearly 10 year lows, although both revenues and profits have grown since then.
As of March 2019 AR, cash & eq + investments was INR 7.4 billion (US$105mm), which means EV of roughly $115mm or net cash represents nearly 50% of market cap.  The company has had a consistently net cash balance sheet (and a growing cash pile), which today represents about 50% of market cap.
Over the last 5 years, FCF has been an average of $32mm, with the low being $22mm last year. This means the FCF yield is between 20% - 30%. For every $1 in free cash eClerx has generated, it has paid out 2/3rds in dividends and repurchases. In the latest quarter, the company completed aINR 2,620mm buyback. 
  At a headline, eClerx has generated positive operating and free cash for 16 years, while growing revenue each year in local currency terms. The company has paid dividends for 15 years typically a payout of 30-40% although this % has reduced in recent years as eClerx has increased its share buybacks meaningfully.
The pessimism in eClerx stems from several reasons:
i) Mr. Market is sceptical of the reinvestment opportunity for its excess cash into growth opportunities, given India is a growth market. For instance, in the last quarter, revenue growth was 4.5% with onshore growing 14% and offshore at 2% YoY,
ii) annual revenue growth has decelerated to low single digits from the heydays of double digit growth and in some quarters, negative. Investors have extrapolated the tepid revenue growth into perpetuity.
iii) operating margins as a result have declined to high teens from nearly 30% 
To be clear, this is not a great company at a great price that is likely to be a high probability of compounding for several years. Yet, at current prices, eClerx presents opportunity to investors to delve further into a business trading at attractive free cash yields. 
From its filings, there are a few points that investors should consider: 
eClerx completed FY 2019 with USD 201mm in revenue – its highest ever
  The company's top ten client concentration decreased for the first time below 70% in the last 2 quarters. This means that the firm's risk profile has improved as the stock price has declined, revenues have gone up.
The company's over $1mm and $5mm client list as of the recent quarter is 21 and 6
a fifth of the firm’s revenue now derives from outside India delivery 
eClerx has been focusing on more advanced technology projects during the year, including machine learning and robotics process automation services to new clients 
Notwithstanding the above cheap valuation and the points listed above, it is difficult to call the bottom on eClerx and it is possible that the stock could remain a value trap, if revenue growth does not materialize. However, the free cash generation, dividends + buybacks and a strong balance sheet provide downside protection for value investors

In this environment, owning self sustaining cash flow generating companies with defensible franchises and great balance sheets is more important than ever. MSFT is arguably one of the world’s best businesses. It boasts great margins and generates enormous free cash flow of $18.4 billion in F’08 and more than $17 billion expected in F’09. It has near monopolistic market shares on the corporate and consumer desktop and laptop markets, as well as great brand recognition. All of this combined with low capital requirements has lead to stellar returns on invested capital, 26% over the past 5 years and in the low 40’s more recently.  The stock has never been cheaper on any metric, trading at approximately 10x F’09 net income.  The current bear market is giving us the opportunity to buy a great company at a great price.
  There are certainly risks associated with MSFT. Clearly consumer and enterprise spending will slow due to the recession. Longer term there are also risks to the franchise from competition from the likes of Linux and GOOG, among others, as well as questions regarding execution and strategy in areas like online search and consumer entertainment. There are also risks associated with capital allocation (YHOO acquisition, etc.). These concerns have all been widely documented and I believe at this valuation have been more than priced into the stock.  
  Despite these risks, I believe the stock is very cheap and its franchise value will endure for longer than the market is currently giving MSFT credit for. Even though the business is maturing sales and income growth has still been quite strong over the past few years. Historically MSFT has not been impacted to a large degree by economic cycles, although I expect this cycle pose more of a challenge to MSFT. The competitive threats are real, but MSFT’s market position is virtually unassailable in some of its key markets.  Furthermore, online and consumer divisions have been masking overall corporate profitability because they are still in a heavy investment phase, so these have been a drain on earnings, but at some point could turn around. As for capital allocation, a dilutive acquisition is still possible, although it seems less likely at this point, and MSFT has a great track record of returning value to shareholders. The company currently has a 2.7% dividend yield and has plans to buy back $40 billion of stock.  Over the past 5 years it has returned $115 billion to shareholders via buybacks and dividends

  My 2009 estimates are based on weakening PC demand, continued share gains by netbooks, and deteriorating consumer spending trends.  Management has guided revenue to $64.9-66.4 billion. F2Q’09 appears to be shaping up fine, but management will most likely have to lower guidance for the balance of the fiscal year.  Client revenues will probably end up declining in the mid single digits for the year, as netbooks take share and PC’s are weaker. OEM will also decelerate based on weaker PC shipments.  The business segment should also feel the pain of the recession and credit environment, but it can still post mid single digit revenue gains. Server and tools should be relatively strong even with the prevailing headwinds as it has a large recurring portion and a strong balance of unearned revenue. Online and consumer should continue to grow, albeit at a much slower pace.  

  I have taken a realistic worst case scenario cut to management’s guidance, but this still leads to nearly flat revenues. It also means that MSFT could generate operating income of almost $22 billion and free cash flow of over $17 billion. A DCF using a 10% cost of capital and 2% terminal growth yields a valuation in the high $20s for the stock, which seems reasonably conservative as it translates into roughly10x EV/EBIT and 8% free cash flow yield on F’09 estimates.

Overview
Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) is a commercial real estate services firm providing sales and leasing brokerage, property and facility management, and investment services to clients around the world. JLL, along with its larger competitor CBRE Group (CBG), is one of only two players with global reach and a full breadth of service offering. Over the course of the past several years, JLL has shifted its business mix towards recurring revenue streams and has demonstrated the resilience of its business model. However, the market still views JLL as a highly cyclical and fragile business. We think this treatment is unwarranted. A meaningful portion of sales brokerage is indeed cyclical, but at this early stage in the commercial real estate recovery, it represents a modest fraction of JLL’s business. Furthermore, as seen in the severe 2008/2009 downturn, the mostly variable cost structure of the brokerage business means that there is little chance of it turning into a cash burning liability, even in the most dire economic backdrop. Property and facility management revenue has been benefitting from a powerful trend of large corporations deciding to outsource real estate management functions, as evidenced by this segment’s high double digit organic growth rate for the last several years. Meanwhile, through the tepid recovery of the past couple of years, JLL’s brokerage businesses appear to have captured significant market share as weaker competitors have fallen by the wayside. JLL’s earnings power has the potential to grow massively: while its outsourcing businesses are in the early phase of a long secular growth ramp, its brokerage businesses are consolidating share as the underlying industry emerges from a cyclical trough. This growth potential is balanced by an unusual degree of resiliency, which makes permanent value impairment highly unlikely. Furthermore, margins remain well below management’s medium term targets, suggesting that there is substantial scope for earnings growth even without help from the underlying markets. At $71 per share, 13x current consensus estimates of 2012 adjusted EPS, the market has created a compelling investment opportunity. Modest revenue growth, paired with management’s continued cost rationalization, should result in 2013 cash earnings per share of ~$7. A slightly more aggressive growth case could result in cash earnings per share over $10. At 14x, giving some credit for secular growth but still a significant discount to JLL’s historical multiples, these results would imply a valuation range 50-100% higher than the current price.  
  JLL’s exposure to the cycle has dropped significantly over the past few years
As the cyclical components of JLL’s business have receded through the downturn, and as recurring businesses like Property and Facility Management have grown, JLL has become increasingly levered to steadier revenue streams. Consider the evolution of the sales composition over the past few years:
            Peak  Trough Most recent
% of Sales   2007 2009 2011
  Leasing     22% 31% 33%
  Capital Markets &   Hotels 21% 8% 13%
  Property & Facility   Mgmt 17% 25% 24%
  Project &   Development Services 11% 13% 12%
  Advisory, Consulting   & Other 16% 12% 10%
  Investment Mgmt   14% 11% 8%
    Total   100% 100% 100%
  Estimated % recurring   59% 92% 73%
Note that the brokerage businesses comprised 46% of 2011 revenue, with most of that coming from leasing. Based on conversations with the company and industry participants, we estimate that in 2007, the peak year for CRE market activity, roughly 70% of the leasing business could have been considered recurring in nature, along with 30% of the capital markets business. These estimates are supported by what was seen in the market downturn. Most leasing activity is generated by the periodic expiration of existing leases, in which case tenants must find new space. The stability of the leasing business can be seen clearly in JLL’s results. Adjusting 2007 revenue for the acquisition of Staubach, a US leasing business that management said was generating roughly $375mm in revenue before it was acquired in mid-2008, peak (2007) to trough (2009) revenue decline was just 19% ($592mm + $375mm = $967mm 2007 PF, vs. $781mm 2009 actual). Sales activity, on the other hand, is generally elective. However, as the financial crisis demonstrated, there does seem to be a base level of activity: even in the 2009 trough year, JLL saw $203mm of Capital Markets revenue, 36% of the $558mm seen during the peak 2007 year. If we assume that the 2009 brokerage levels represent a base, and make an adjustment for the acquisition of King Sturge which closed in 2011, this implies that in 2011 70% of leasing brokerage revenues and 61% of capital markets brokerage revenues were recurring. While there are cyclical aspects to JLL’s business, there is much less exposure at this point in the cycle than there was in 2007. 
  JLL’s stable outsourcing business is seeing strong secular growth  
Meanwhile, the less cyclical portion of JLL’s business is in a strong secular growth phase. While the last few years have been choppy for the brokerage business, the outsourcing business lines have seen a period of strong and steady expansion. Property and Facility Management has grown at a CAGR of 18% from 2007 to 2011 and now contributes roughly 25% of revenue.

Large corporations are increasingly looking to outsource costly and time-consuming real estate management functions. According to CBG, real estate related expenses represent 4-5% of revenue for most Fortune 500 companies. Outsourcing can typically reduce such costs by 10-15%: fixed real estate management expense can be lowered, and efficiencies can be squeezed out of rent and occupancy costs. Not surprisingly, a potential operating margin improvement in the 40-75bps range is very attractive to corporate management teams. The recent economic sluggishness has driven attention towards cost rationalization, and real estate expenses are a prime target. JLL and CBG, being the only two providers of outsourcing with international scope and full breadth of service, have been the beneficiaries of this trend. By all accounts, the secular trend of outsourcing property management services is creating a network effect that accrues in favor of the largest providers of commercial real estate services. While the growth has been impressive for the past several years, the trend is self re-enforcing. Moreover, there is no indication that the trend is hitting slower growth due to a “law of large numbers.” On a recent call, CBG’s CEO described this market as still being in its “infancy,” and has noted the potential for continued double digit growth into the indefinite future. CBG has also pegged the total outsourcing revenue opportunity in the $50-60 billion range, implying that current market penetration is low. Evidence of this can be seen in JLL’s recent results: Property and Facility Management revenue grew 19% in Q1 2012, vs. growth of 12% in Q1 2011, and in Q2 2012 it grew 15% vs. growth of 10% in the prior year period. On recent earnings calls, JLL’s management has noted that the pipeline for this business continues to strengthen, and therefore sees no indication that growth should slow. 
  CRE cycle points to substantial potential upside for brokerage business
As discussed, the cyclical brokerage fees are a relatively minor contributor to JLL’s current earnings. But it is important to remember that this is to a large extent a function of the underlying markets that remain at relatively low levels. Unlike at the peak in 2007, there is little room to fall. US commercial real estate transaction volumes remain below 2004 levels. The table below shows the dollar volume of US office sales transactions, which make up the majority of JLL’s Americas Capital Markets business:
          2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011

There are many reasons to think that activity will continue to rebound. One of the most compelling is the recent trend in office space construction. Depreciation steadily eats away at real estate supply, while population growth steadily increases demand. For balance, the market requires construction activity to replenish supply. However, additions to supply have languished at trough levels for the past few years. The following chart shows annual office space completions, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of total office inventory:
          2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011

This trend is particularly interesting when considered in relation to office rents. While rents are not back to the peak levels that were briefly seen in early late 2007/early 2008, they are still at levels in line with the 2006/2007 time period, when construction activity was relatively healthy.
          2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011

Despite this, supply additions have been minimal. This indicates that rents need to rise further to drive construction, and therefore keep the commercial real estate market moving towards equilibrium. Rising rents and property prices drive not only value per transaction, but also transaction volume, as investors and consumers of corporate real estate attempt to profit from the perceived contango. Such a trend would be very favorable for JLL’s brokerage business, and it appears to be underway. Though the pace is measured, the rate of sequential change has accelerated in each of the past three quarters:
  While the precise timing and scale of a commercial real estate cyclical rebound will remain difficult to predict, JLL should benefit to a degree disproportionate to that seen in the prior cycle. JLL commands a much larger share of the US brokerage market today than it did in 2007.

Market share gains add leverage to potential upside
JLL has experienced dramatic share gains over the past few years. This is supported by a comparison of JLL’s Americas Capital Markets revenue to total US office market sales volumes. The chart below shows that over the 2007 to 2011 time period, JLL’s revenue as a percent of its most relevant markets increased by 2.5-3x. While JLL may have seen some benefit from improving fee structures, industry contacts say that fees have been mostly stable, implying that most of the growth has come from market share:

  ""Yield"" (JLL   Rev/Mkt) (bps) 14.7 23.7 59.7 37.1 38.4 2.6x
There are a number of factors behind this trend. During the cyclical downturn, small and mid-size firms fell out of the market, and brokers gravitated towards stability. In addition, the secular outsourcing trend that is driving strong growth for the Property and Facility Management segment has also strengthened JLL’s position in brokerage. When corporate clients adopt management services, they are more likely to use the same provider for brokerage needs as well. The clear trend of market share gain seems to confirm the presence of a positive network effect that our industry contacts have described. As a result, the next market upturn should be substantially more lucrative for JLL than those in the past.
  Potential for margin expansion
Regardless of the timing of the next real estate cycle, JLL should also be able to deliver meaningful earnings growth through margin improvement. After a period of heavy investment relating to international infrastructure and aggressive hiring to take advantage of market weakness (which has paid a healthy dividend in the form of increased market share), cost pressure is now receding. Margins in the Americas segment have been disappointing over the past year due to over-hiring in late 2010. Excess costs were gradually pulled out of the business over the course of 2011, so according to management, 2012 should see significantly higher margin levels with basic “blocking and tackling.” This is already starting to be seen, with Americas margins showing sequentially higher year over year growth in each of the past three quarters. In EMEA, margins slumped through most of 2011 as management integrated King Sturge and continued to reconcile an excessive fixed cost base to the current low activity levels, but have rebounded with strong year over year improvement in each of the past three quarters. Asia-Pacific has shown consistent margin expansion since the downturn, but still remains well below peak levels. Q2 2012 was a setback in Asia Pacific margins, as the high margin brokerage business dipped relative to an extremely strong result in the prior year quarter. Investment Management is already back at target levels, demonstrating its resiliency. All in all, management sees a clear path to a 15% EBITDA margin in the medium term, vs. the 11% margin posted in 2011. Importantly, this target does not include any potential benefit from a rebound in investment management incentive fees, and it assumes steady to slightly growing revenue.
  Why JLL?
Our references to CBG beg the question, why JLL? In general we like the case for CBG as well, and have invested behind them in the past. However, we prefer JLL for several reasons. First, JLL is cheaper on almost any metric. 2012 consensus values JLL at 13x earnings, while CBG is valued at nearly 14.5x. Many seem to ascribe the valuation differential to the perception that CBG offers more upside leverage due to a more aggressive management team and exposure to the more volatile middle market. While CBG is a more levered equity, and its management targets what appear to be much more aggressive margin targets, we haven’t seen much to suggest that CBG’s earnings should necessarily grow faster than JLL’s. On the other hand, we like JLL’s consistent and well integrated international operations, which should bode well for their ability to land multi-national clients. Industry contacts also have noted that JLL has a much stronger franchise than CBG in East Asian growth markets, particularly mainland China. In addition, JLL ended 2011 with a trailing net debt to EBITDA ratio, including earn-outs, of ~1.5x vs. CBG’s ~2x. While not a dramatic difference, JLL has a bit more balance sheet firepower to take advantage of further market consolidation opportunities. Finally, we like the candor and caution of JLL’s management team. While CBG has a tendency to make over-reaching statements, JLL strikes a consistently measured tone and lays out attainable goals.  
  Valuation
JLL is inexpensive at 13x the 2012 consensus earnings estimate. Clearly there is significant skepticism in the market. This is understandable, given that we have only seen the seasonally slow first half, and given the cloudiness of the macro outlook. While near term prognostication is difficult, it is perhaps more interesting to note that JLL’s shares are also reasonably priced based on 2011’s adjusted EPS: under 15x the $4.82 result. As discussed above, JLL was able to generate these earnings on a revenue base that is largely de-risked – we would consider nearly 75% of it to be recurring. In other words, JLL is cheaply priced even if there is a slowdown or pause in the commercial real estate recovery, especially when considering the potential for margin expansion. If we assume that management gets to an EBITDA margin of 13.3%, only halfway to their targeted EBITDA margin of 15%, and if cyclical revenues lines experience low single digit growth rates, we think that JLL can generate 2013 cash earnings per share of ~$7. A multiple of 14x, to reflect the ongoing secular growth opportunity from market consolidation and continued corporate outsourcing of real estate services, would imply a share price of ~$100. If a firmer recovery materializes, and the cyclical lines show growth in the 10% range, higher revenue in concert with additional margin expansion could result in 2013 cash earnings of over $10 per share. Again applying the relatively modest 14x multiple to give credit for secular growth, the implied price of $140 is double the current share price. While these numbers might appear aggressive, note that the share price hit $120 in 2007 with a weaker business composition. Before Eurozone fears in 2011 cast doubt on a steady real estate recovery, the share hit the $105 level. If a 2008-like meltdown were to occur, we estimate that FCF/share would fall to ~$4.00. At a punitive 10x multiple, the downside would be 45%. The upside potential more than compensates for this risk. JLL is an unusually attractive opportunity because it pairs potentially explosive cyclical upside with powerful secular trends. As the commercial real estate services market continues to consolidate, and as penetration of corporate outsourcing continues to expand, JLL’s scale advantages will not just continue to grow, but should accelerate.

Description: 
I believe The Pennant Group Inc. “Pennant” (Nasdaq: PNTG) a provider of home care and senior living facilities is a short after shares have more than doubled (+111%) in the past 5 weeks on no news. 
  I believe the opportunity to short PNTG comes from a lack of understanding in investment community what Pennant really is due to: 
A lack of sell side coverage with only one analyst Frank Morgan of RBC covering PNTG with a “Sector Perform” Hold rating and $20 price target (42% downside from current price). 
  Indiscriminate generalists have rushed to buy PNTG shares due to fact that it is a spin- off. Yes, I know this is the opposite of the dynamics described by our own JG in his seminal book You Can be a Stock Market Genius, but I do believe this is a real phenomenon in today’s market. 
  As a result, Pennant is trading at a significant premium to home health and hospice peers on all metrics. 
  I believe investors are ascribing Pennant’s home health and hospice business which is currently doing $19m per year in EBITDA a 49x EBITDA multiple which is roughly 25 turns higher EV/EBITDA than unlevered, higher margin and similar growth rate peers like Amedisys trading at 24x and LHCG trading at 21x). However, even more concerning than the extreme valuation gap I believe investors are overlooking significant negative factors about the Pennant story:  
  Significantly inferior business mix versus home health peers AMED, LHCG, CHE with 40% of PNTG revenue coming from inherently asset heavy, oversupplied Senior Living segment where peers who own significant real estate like Brookdale (of which PNTG owns none) trade in the 10x EBITDA range and have suffered years of stock underperformance due to industry supply growth driven by the relentless search for yield in a 0-1% interest rate world 
  Significant capital lease balance sheet leverage (PNTG is levered ~4.9x Debt+ Capital Leases/EBITDAR) versus covenant of ~5x that will limit the pace of acquisitions and growth and make it difficult for PNTG to grow into their way above peer valuation any time soon without significant equity share issuances. 
  Background: 
Pennant is a provider of home health & hospice (60% of Revenue) and senior living facilities (40% of Revenue) recently spun off from Ensign Group (ENSG). Ensign has admittedly has a strong history of shareholder value creation through acquisitions of underperforming nursing facilities; however, I believe given Pennant’s current valuation it will be very difficult for PNTG to deliver above market equity returns at least in the intermediate term. To illustrate the gap between Ensign in its infancy versus Pennant today:  In January 2008 (before crash) ENSG had a $300m EV in relationship to $54m in EBITDA (5.5x); today PNTG has a $1B TEV in relationship to $25m in EBITDA (40x). 
  Pennant is a combination of two distinct business units from within Ensign. Senior Living had been the orphan segment within Pennant gradually accumulated since the Ensign’s founding in 1999 and cordoned off as a separate business unit in 2010. The homecare segment was the brainchild of current Pennant CEO Danny Walker who was working as a lawyer within Ensign when he got the greenlight to incubate a potential new segment focused on home health and hospice. Despite Danny not running the senior living business within Ensign, it was lumped together with his homecare venture in order to create a company that on a consolidated basis was large enough to be public. 
  Bottom line is Pennant’s two segments have significantly different business characteristics, asset requirements/leverage levels, operating environments and peer multiples. Given there is little synergy between the two businesses I think they should be valued separately using a sum of the parts (also the methodology that PNTG’s only analyst Frank Morgan of RBC uses). 
  Recent Results: 
Hard to say the recent stock performance is due to exceptionally strong financial results. In Q3’19 Pennant’s only quarter as a public company consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (excludes 3.4m in 1x separation costs) was $6.495m versus $7.180m in prior year Q3’18. 
  The company attributes this wage inflation in nursing as well as impact of recent lower margin acquisitions. 
  Senior Living Segment: 
  While the sky isn’t falling in this segment it suffers from several years of supply growth ahead of demand. This is likely due to operators who set up senior living facilities with the idea to monetize the real estate at very low cap rates given search for yield. 
 

CEO Danny Walker isn’t holding his breath for an improving market dynamic in senior living:  
  So I'm probably not the best -- I'm not as -- we generally aren't as concerned about whether we're meeting an inflection point or how closely that's going to be. We're not holding our breath. -Q3’19 CC
  Other operators in the space have had issues as well. Capital Senior Living (CSU) is a distressed equity after several years of revenue declines driven by industry wide overcapacity. Brookdale Senior Living has struggled with its share price down over 80% in the last 5 years. 
  If Pennant executes as well as people seem to think they can then sure Senior Living can be an ok business. 
  I only argue this business has significantly different characteristics from home health and hospice which are asset light, variable cost models with higher organic growth. 
  Senior Living Segment Leases: 
The Pennant Group Balance sheet carries $241m in capital lease debt. 
Rent coverage may be good relative to distressed peers in the industry this is still a very levered asset with EBITDAR/Rent overage ratio of 1.48x based on Q3’19 financials. 
  The peers in this segment are Brookdale (owns a chunk of real estate) and I would argue you could say the parent company Ensign is a peer of sorts as they are a facility based provider (albeit one with a clinical bent and a government payor revenue stream). Ensign also owns a significant amount of real estate. 
  Historically the returns in the post-acute facility-based space have been a lot higher for the lessor than the operator (see Vencor which spun out Kindred Healthcare and Ventas with the latter massively outperforming the former). 
  As far as valuation is concerned, I believe something in line with Brookdale (10x EBITDA) and Ensign (11x EBITDA) is reasonable for this segment.  


Home Health and Hospice Segment: 
Unlike senior living, home health and hospice is an area that is very much in favor given the secular growth and shift in patients from higher cost post-acute settings into this home. While this segment is clearly what drives most of the value at Pennant, it is not without its own concerns. 
  The first point I would make is health care reimbursement and valuations are cyclical. This is counterintuitive given these businesses are almost completely detached (at least on the revenue side) from the overall business cycle. 
  However, the home health and hospice sector has just gone through a massive 5 year upcycle in terms of valuations and margins after bottoming post the early implementation of “Rebasing” a series of cuts that took place 2014-2018. I believe this will happen again at some point. Recently the industry is rejoicing in their victory at having the punitive aspect of Patient Driven Groupings Model (PDGM) pushed out another year. 
  That said, many veteran industry observers believe its only a matter of time until another cut comes. 
Recently MedPAC published a presentation pushing for a 7% rate cut in 2021. 
  From MedPAC: 
Historically, home health Medicare margins averaged better than 16% from 2001 to 2017, according to MedPAC.
“Medicare has overpaid for home health since the [Prospective Payment System] was established. The fact that home health can be a high-value service does not justify these excessive overpayments,” one official argued. “These overpayments do not benefit the beneficiary or the taxpayer.”
In 2018, the average home health fee-for-service Medicare margin checked in at 18%. MedPAC estimates that margins for 2020 will hover around 21%.
“This is a result of several payment and cost changes,” the official said.
While Peer company Amedysis now trades for over 20x forward 2020 EBITDA and nearly 2.5x Revenues it was as recently as June 2014 that AMED had a $335m market cap and was trading for .3x Revenues. Things are good now. Maybe they stay good a long time. All I am saying is historically we are closer to the peak in terms of home health and hospice margins and multiples than we are the trough. 
The 4% cut people feared with PDGM has been averted for now but in my opinion, it is a matter of when, not if, there will be another cut in this industry.  
Valuation: 
Given PNTG has limited historical financials I will use a combination of the Q3’19 run rate for each segment as well as PNTG 2020 guidance. I chose to allocate unallocated costs to each segment in the ratio of each segments revenue to total company revenue. 
  Sure you could value each segment and ignore the corporate costs, but if that is the case you would have to use an M&A multiple for each segment as opposed to a platform multiple. Given acquirers typically pay single digit multiples of EBITDA for these assets and Pennant’s only chance of being worth what it is trading for is as a platform company that acquires other companies, I believe including unallocated costs in our valuation is a must. 
  First I start by valuing Pennant groups Senior Living Segment. 
Facts: 
This segment produced $1.865m in Adjusted EBITDA in Q3’19
Annualizing this aEBITDA gets us a run rate of $7.5m 
This segment carries $241m in capital leases with an EBITDAR/Rent Coverage of <1.5x 
  Peers I will use for comparability are Brookdale (BKD) and Ensign (ENSG) both facility-based providers. As I mentioned earlier both of these comparables own a number of their facilities real estate whereas Pennant group owns none of their real estate. 
  Brookdale has a $4.6B TEV excluding capital leases and generates around $430m in annual EBITDA or ~10x EBITDA
Ensign has a $2.6B TEV excluding capital lease debt and generates $240m of EBITDA or ~11x 
Select Medical another facility based provider has a $7.1B TEV and generates around $700m in EBITDA, also trading around ~10x. 
  Sensing a pattern here? Don’t see a good reason why Pennants facility based Senior Living segment is worth more than plus or minus 10.5x EBITDA. 
  Using the segment’s $7.5m run rate and a 10.5x multiple we get an equity value for this segment of ~$80m or $2.85/share. 
To be a bit more conservative lets use PNTG consensus EBITDA for 2020 of $28m and apply 30% (ratio of senior living segment EBITDA to consolidated EBITDA in Q3’19) to come to an EBITDA estimate of $8.4m for 2020. Using the same 10.5x EBITDA we get an equity value of $88m or $3.15 per share. 
  Now we can do some basic math. 
  Pennant group has 28m shares outstanding and their share price is $34.78 for a $974m market cap. 
  In Pennant’s Q3’19 Press Release they state that their net debt excluding leases to adjusted EBITDA ratio was .95x which implies net debt of $25m which would give us a TEV of $999m. 
  For simplicity Pennant is a $1 Billion TEV company excluding their capital lease liabilities. 
  If we assume the Senior Living segment is worth $88m as we outlined above, that implies investors are paying slightly above $911m for the home health and hospice segment of Pennant. 
  Using Q3’19 run rate EBITDA this segment is generating $18.4m in EBITDA for an implied 50x EV/run rate EBITDA 
  Using 2020 consensus and assuming 70% of consolidated EBITDA is attributable to the Senior Living segment that implies $19.6m of EBITDA or a EV/EBITDA of 47x. 
  That is just too high of a multiple for a company that sends out skilled nurses to peoples homes and has massive customer concentration with the US government (CMS).  
  I would value the home health segment in line with peers in the 20-25x range. 
  Using 22x 2020 estimated EBITDA of $19.6m we get a value of $430m for the segment which I believe is generous. Add in the $90m of value we are ascribing to the senior living segment and that gets us an EV of $520 and a market cap of $495m and a stock price of $17.67 per share or roughly 50% below the current share price. Even after losing half of its equity value, PNTG would still trade at 20x consolidated 2019 aEBITDA and 18x 2020 consensus EBITDA. 


I was going to lift a passage from Frank Morgan's latest report where he lays out his valuation. Then it came time to submit and I got scared of potentially using someones work without permission. Safe to say he uses a $20 price target and that INCLUDES an EBITDA number nearly 35% higher than current levels which he gets to by baking in future acquisitions. Check it out on your own. 
  Frank is taking a slightly different approach to valuation, but he is at least in the same ballpark. 
    Acquisitions: 
  Pennant is currently 4.85x lease adjusted leverage and 1x net debt levered. They have a 2x leverage covenant (and some negative covenants around 5x lease adjusted leverage). 
  So how much EBITDA can they acquire? 
  There is little information available about purchase price or revenue multiples in Pennant’s S1 so I will assume they are acquiring at a fully synergized 6x EBITDA multiple although in hospice it could be higher than that given how high M&A multiples are in that sector. 
  If we assume they are willing to go up to 2x net levered that would give them room to acquire about $6m of ebitda for $35m which would give them net debt of $60m versus adjusted ebitda in the low $30s on a proforma basis. 
  PNTG stock would still trade at ~30x EBITDA still well above peers. 
Perhaps they can accelerate their acquisition pace through equity issuances. 
While this is possible and a potential risk to the short I think its unlikely for two reasons: 
Limited number of targets within Pennant’s geographic clusters become available in any year
Pennant’s growth is limited by their ability to develop enough management capacity to take on more acquisition
  Given these limiting factors, even if Pennant does an equity raise (which they should in my opinion given their very expensive currency) I think they will struggle to significantly increase the pace of their acquisitions. 


Conclusion: 
While Pennant is an OK company, investors are overlooking Pennant’s mix and shadow leverage and as a result mis-valuing PNTG equity. I believe as time goes by investors will better understand Pennant’s business mix. This could happen as other sell side analysts cover the stock.  It will also become more apparent with time that it will be difficult to grow EBITDA at a fast enough pace to justify a valuation of around 50x home health EBITDA. In a best case scenario I believe it will take several years of flawless execution for Pennant to conceivably grow into its multiple and be valued with the same ballpark as peers. In this time its likely at some point there will be an execution stumble or a reimbursement or regulatory monkey wrench that will revalue Pennant’s shares significantly lower.

  Eagle Bancorp of Montana (EBMT)
(Market Cap of $45.9M, including ESOP shares, at $11.25 per share as of February 18, 2011)
  Eagle Bancorp Montana (EBMT) is a profitable bank, with minimal non-performing assets, in an attractive geographic area, that is selling at a 15% discount to tangible book value.
  EBMT is a holding company for American Federal Savings Bank, which operates six branches out of Montana.  EBMT offers traditional retail banking products including money market accounts, CD accounts, and checking/savings accounts.  Its loan portfolio consists primarily of real estate (RE) loans, of which about 60% is 1-4 family residential RE loans and 22% commercial RE, 8% construction/land development, and the remainder a mix of commercial/industrial loans and personal loans.  EBMT completed its second step conversion on April 5, 2010 to a fully publicly owned stock company where it raised $24.6 million at $10 per share.  EBMT has total equity capital of $52.8 million and $332.9 million in total assets.  Management has been looking to utilize the capital raised by making acquisitions and facilitating organic growth. 
  Attractive characteristics:
Favorable geographic area of operation - Relative to the rest of the nation, EBMT operates in a financially healthy region. Lewis and Clark County, where EBMT has the majority of its deposits, has an unemployment rate of 5.3%..
  Healthy balance sheet and minimum asset issues - As of December 31, 2010, non-performing assets were only 1.16%.  Management attributes this to conservative underwriting standards and the fact that Montana did not undergo boom/bust cycles.

Steady historical profitability - Despite having very low non-performing assets, the Bank has a steady history of profitability. For the five calendar years prior to the second step conversion, American Federal Savings Bank had an average ROE of 8.7%.
  NPA % ROE %
2009 0.76% 12.8%
2008 0.09% 8.3%
2007 0.07% 6.8%
2006 0.21% 7.6%
2005 0.16% 7.8%
Potential for growth - Given its low leverage ratio today, there is significant more room for growth.  EBMT's Assets/Equity ratio is currently only 6.3X.

Discount to Book - EBMT is currently trading at approximately a 15% discount to tangible book value.  Given its discount and its potential for organic growth, EBMT would make an attractive acquisition candidate. Banks with this profile should be trading at a premium to tangible BV.  Given its history of conservatism and profitability, the risk associated with this investment is relatively low at a price below tangible book value.

  This is a long recommendation for the shares of Hanover Foods, a vertically integrated vegetable and food company.  The investment thesis really boils down to the following:   Despite a liquidity discount, a minority share discount, lack of transparency, and reprehensible corporate governance - 4 times earnings for a consumer non-cyclical food company is an irresistible valuation.    There is no catalyst here.  It is just a cheap stock.  I categorize it as a ""one day"" stock.  Meaning that one day I will wake up and read a press release that Hanover Foods has been acquired for a meaningful premium to current prices - or this is the hope.
Hanover Foods has some brand recognition, in some markets, but is primarily involved in private label products.
There are two classes of stock, class A  and class B.  Class B symbol is HNFSB.PK  and has one vote per share.  Class A symbol is HNFSA.PK, and has no votes.  The company ""went dark"" (deregistered from the SEC) in the fourth quarter of 2004.   The only way to obtain quarterly or annual reports is to be a shareholder.   Owning one share either as a registered owner, or in street name, will get you an annual report, and quarterly reports. 
A starting point for a curious investor would be form SC 13E3 filed with the SEC 12-06-04.  This filing includes a valuation by accounting firm Gocial Gerstein LLC, which in my opinion conservatively values  the A shares at 131.00 per share.  The objective of this valuation was for the company to value the shares in order get rid of their smaller shareholders, reduce their shareholder list below 300, and deregister.   My personal belief is that most VIC members do their own due diligence.  Rather than cut and paste the details of the valuation, my preference is to simply provide the link.

At this point you might remark:  ""Ok, big deal, the HNFSA trades at around 100.""    Others might wonder how much the company has made since going private?  The short answer is since being conservatively valued at 131 per share the company has earned and retained ....roughly 80$ per share.   So using a not-very-fancy method of valuing the shares, a simpleton investor might say 131ish plus 80ish  is 211ish.
Why is it so cheap then?  Where should I start...
The company, to my knowledge, has not had an annual meeting in four years.  The company is registered in the state of Pennsylvania, which is notorious for siding with corporate management.  Compounding the problem is something called the Employee Stock Trust, colloquially referred to by accountants as a ""Rabbi Trust.""  This is a very murky topic, admittedly, for me.  But, for some reason these shares do not count for anything other than voting rights.  They appear in the annual report in the Stockholder's Equity sections, and raise some concerns when trying to evaluate how many shares are actually outstanding.  Several investors I know that are involved in the stock, prefer to error on the safe side and count these shares as outstanding when determining book value.  Gocial Gerstein, ignores the shares in the EST and uses 740,000 shares outstanding.  They ignore the 340,000 shares in the trust.  I once talked to their current auditor at BDO Seidman (they do provide audited financials).  I posed the question as simply as possible:  ""If the company is acquired for say 400 million in cash, do the shares in the ""rabbi trust"" get cashed out.""  His answer:  ""No, they just disappear.""  ""The cash gets divided amongst the 740,000 shares only?""  ""Yes"".
  There is also a long running family feud that has embroiled the company in a legal battle.  I am reluctant to post all the details of this legal battle in this portion of the report, primarily based on the amount of time it would require for me to do it accurately.

The shares are closely held.  Normally the HNFSB trades at a premium to the A.  Currently the B stock is offered at 105 and the A stock is offered at 104.  If the difference is only a dollar I would suggest buying the B stock at the higher price.  For some reason there seems to be plenty of B shares available lately, which is rare.  If the B goes a little higher, compared to the A, I would buy the A.
Heartland Value Fund owns roughly 49,000 shares, I think.

Introduction
  This investment idea originated from a variant perception we had recently.  When attending an auto parts symposium, we heard a steady drumbeat from presenters (and attendees) that both autonomous cars and electrification were so far away in the future that they were completely immaterial to their business prospects.  It reminded us of newspapers claiming the internet would benefit them.  While the auto parts industry is saying self-driving isn’t coming for years and years, some of the people who are actually working on it (Google) are saying they’re opening services to the public this very year.  GM and others are saying more like 2019.  So while basically half the industry thinks autonomous vehicles are coming in five years; we think they’re coming in two.  It is more well known that virtually every major auto OEM is coming out with electric and hybrid models in the early 2020s. We believe EV adoption will take place faster than do most observers.  
  We believe we have found a reasonable way to be aligned with these trends through investment in Aptiv.  Basically, Aptiv makes a lot of the stuff that goes into autonomous and electric vehicles.  They should experience solid revenue growth as these trends take hold and they increase their content per vehicle.  In a few years’ time, as these trends become more generally accepted and the investing public gets excited, we believe Aptiv could see significant multiple expansion as one of the few pure play options to take advantage of this investing theme.  In the meantime, it is a profitable, well-run company, one that is of decent quality while not having a wide moat, that is trading as a reasonable price given its growth potential.  
  This is a somewhat long-term play that we intend to hold into the early 2020s when the electric and autonomous trends are fully underway.  Using conservative assumptions we think Aptiv could do $7 in EPS by 2022 (consensus is more optimistic at $8) and with no multiple expansion at 20x would be worth $140, or 50% upside as a conservative base case.  We think both operational results, and especially the multiple, could surprise to the upside as the trends described above take hold.
  Aptiv the Company
Aptiv is the descendent of Delphi Automotive, itself once upon a time the auto parts spin off from GM.  In order to be fully aligned with the above described trends it recently spun off its powertrain segment into what is now Delphi Technologies, and it renamed itself Aptiv.  Headquartered on the island of Jersey (and therefore not a real beneficiary of recent US tax reform), Aptiv is a global company with revenue about equally split between US, Europe, and Asia that works with every major OEM.  Though an auto parts supplier, they are no longer really a “metal bender” as the products they make are primarily electronics and wires.  The company has 6,000 engineers focused on software development and ships over 40 billion lines of code daily.
  Their largest segment is Signal and Power Solutions with $9.5B in revenue and $1.3B of operating profit.  The segment basically makes cables and other power distribution equipment.  Management expects this division to grow 2 to 5% faster than the overall automotive market.
  Their other segment is Advanced Safety and User Experience with $3.4B in revenue and $300MM of operating profit.  It makes sensors for automatic safety features like lane departure and automatic braking, as well as the software and computing power needed to power those systems.  It also makes “infotainment displays” (most of the current revenue) and has a fledgling “connected services” data subdivision designed to help with things like secure over the air software updates to vehicles and the collection and eventual marketing of data.  Management expects this division to grow 10% faster than the overall market.  
  While this was not our reason for purchase, we do like that this company was part of a spin off situation recently.  Even though it was the parent and not the actual spinoff, our research has indicated that parents as well as spinoffs outperform the general market on a statistical basis.  They did appear to do a substantial roadshow before the spinoff but nevertheless this is somewhat of a new pure-play automotive trend company and we would expect the story to continue to become more well known over time.
  It’s also worth noting that this company bears little resemblance to the original Delphi that filed for bankruptcy in ‘05.  They shed major divisions during bankruptcy and more recently sold their thermal systems business in ‘15 and spun off their powertrain business in Dec ‘17.  Like much of the automotive ecosystem, they got religion on debt after the financial crisis and today carry only $2.5B in debt versus $2B in EBITDA which covers interest 15 times.  It has been consistently profitable on both a net income and free cash flow basis since its emergence from bankruptcy in 2011 (not saying much).  Their return on invested capital has been well north of 20% during this period as well; over half of management’s incentive compensation is related to return on capital.  With this capital, management has been a steady purchaser of shares reducing the share count from 328MM to 266MM most recently.  They have also done a number of small bolt on acquisitions in growth areas which they intend to continue to do.
  A quick pitch on electric and autonomous cars
  A big part of the investment thesis is the faster-than-expected adoption of autonomous and electric vehicles.  The arguments for this adoption are available elsewhere but since they are an important part of the pitch, and are not universally accepted, we will offer a very brief explanation for our thinking.  
  For autonomous, the reason to believe adoption is around the corner is mostly due to what the companies themselves are saying.  Google/Waymo has been the most vocal about their progress, saying that they’ve had fully driverless cars on the road in Arizona since mid-Oct 2017 (employees still in the car, just not the driver’s seat), and that they will have a fully driverless mobility service in Arizona in “early 2018”.  GM/Cruise has said they will have a fully autonomous (no steering wheel) public ride-sharing system service across several cities by 2019.  Aptiv, which has its own “turnkey” autonomous driving suite, will have a commercial test deployment in 2019.  2019 appears to be shaping up as the year of the autonomous vehicle.  These specific, near-term claims of deployment to us are more convincing than the mostly vague claims of skeptics that these technologies are “many years off”.  It is worth noting that one of the reasons the development of this technology has been accelerating is the continued advancement of deep learning techniques, which allow for AI to help determine how to drive through the introduction of massive amounts of data, whereas previously autonomous driving software had to be programmed to react to each individual situation.  One of the main roadblocks to adoption that skeptics see are regulatory.  We believe these roadblocks will largely disappear once there is a demonstrated effective autonomous driving network in place, which as stated above, we believe will take place in 2019, probably in Arizona.  We believe opposition will evaporate upon proof-of-concept due to safety concerns.  40,000 people in America die every year in auto accidents, the vast majority of which are due to human error.  Of course, these deaths are not nearly as emotional as the few hundreds that die each year due to school shootings or terrorism, but one can imagine that, once-proven, there will be a large constituency pushing for the removal of regulatory barriers to adoption of autonomous driving.
  For electrification, the climate-change-related advantage of not directly emitting CO2 is well publicized and understood.  It is worth noting that the sometimes encountered “long tailpipe” argument that electric vehicles are just as or more dirty than conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles basically does not hold unless the power charging the vehicles comes solely from coal (which is being phased out by regulation and market forces).  Electric vehicles have other advantages over ICE vehicles in having much simpler engines with far fewer moving parts, meaning less maintenance and lower costs.  EV acceleration is generally better as is handling due to the ability to put a heavy battery in the bottom.  The problem of course is cost, which is basically a battery concern.  If you get the cost of the battery down, EVs would appear to be superior.  The costs of batteries have indeed been coming down, and given the massive amounts of money that are flowing into the area, we expect this trend to continue.  According to Andreesen Horowitz, most analysts assume electric cars will be equal to the cost of ICE cars without subsidies by 2025.  However, we think adoption will not be driven slowly by consumer choice, but rapidly by regulatory action.  Climate advocates for EVs are of course, quite passionate.  The main opposition to EVs is cost-based, and once EV’s achieve near cost-parity, we believe opposition will largely evaporate.  We believe that once near cost-parity is achieved, regulators will cram EV’s down our throats by basically outlawing or taxing ICEs out of existence.  Numerous European countries have set targets for banning the sale of ICE vehicles, but China probably has the most aggressive targets of anyone, due not to fears of global warming, but pollution.  It is worth noting that all ICE vehicles emit nitrogen oxide gases and fine particulates that cause public health issues, as science and the public are becoming increasingly aware.  There are of course other barriers to the complete widespread adoption of EV’s, but to keep this short it will suffice to say that we believe these barriers will be overcome in large part due to the regulatory response driven by popular concern over climate change.
  How does Aptiv benefit from these trends and competitive landscape
  Basically Aptiv makes the stuff that cars already need, but that they need more of when they become electric and autonomous.  For autonomous, this includes things like sensors, computing power, and signal and power wiring to connect it all.  For safety reasons, in a fully autonomous vehicle all the signal and power distribution needs to have redundancy in order to not fail, which means more material.  We have heard Aptiv’s Multi-Domain Controller, which “fuses information from sensing systems as well as mapping and navigation data to make driving decisions,” called the “picks and shovels” of autonomous.  For electric (and hybrid), Aptiv makes wires, connectors, and distributors necessary for the distribution of high voltage electric power throughout the car.  They also make charging technologies.  
  On the most recent call, management (somewhat worryingly) declined to state the increase in Aptiv content that would be implied by electric vehicles, but our industry specialist friend informs us the increase is six fold. Lear is a competitor to Aptiv in electrical systems and they publish content per vehicle (CPV) of about $400.  Considering ⅔ of Lear’s revenue is in their seating division, one might estimate their electrical CPV at $135.  On the Q4 transcript, the SVP of Lear’s E-systems said that their incremental CPV for 48 volt mild hybrids was $300, and for full EVs was $2,000.  $2,000 / $135 implies a fifteen fold revenue opportunity in the transition from today’s ICE to fully electric vehicles.
  Unfortunately at this time we do not have have an estimate at the increase in CPV for today’s cars versus fully autonomous cars, but the related part of Aptiv’s business that provides Level 1 and 2 automated driving (active safety) recently grew at a rapid 65% pace.
  To be clear, Aptiv is not the only company that makes many of these products, and they will face competition.  Furthermore, there are many different companies and alliances competing for dominance in these fields, and it is not at all clear who the winners will be.  We approach this investment not from the standpoint that Aptiv will necessarily be the winner themselves, but more from a standpoint that a rising tide lifts all boats.  If the demand for high voltage auto electrical distribution systems increases exponentially, then all makers of high voltage automotive electrical distribution systems will likely benefit.  
  Aptiv works with all major OEMs (including Tesla) so Aptiv should benefit to some degree regardless of whoever “wins the race”.  Even if the first to market is not a traditional OEM, the example of Tesla’s production struggles has shown that if the winner wants to take full advantage of their first mover advantage by making a meaningful number of cars they will probably have to partner with the existing auto ecosystem.  Aptiv has said they have no interest in being a direct “mobility on demand” service provider like Uber/Lyft/Waymo.
  Aptiv has partnered with Intel and Mobileye on their “CSLP” platform, which is their full stack “turnkey” autonomous solution which will supposedly be commercially available in 2019.  So perhaps they will be a direct winner outright.  Navigant recently published a report on the automated driving leaderboard and they placed Aptiv at 7th (ahead of all other parts manufacturers).  
  In addition to offering their full autonomous solution, Aptiv has indicated a willingness to partner with any player on basically handling any part of their system.  For example, perhaps one partner prefers to use their own software and computing hardware, but wishes to utilize Aptiv’s sensor and signal technology.  According to the recent Navigant leaderboard report, the current leader is GM, who is Aptiv’s largest customer.  In second place is Google’s Waymo, which is reported to make their own sensors, but also recently placed an order for thousands of minivans from Fiat Chrysler, who is Aptiv’s third largest customer. Number 6 on the leaderboard is BMW-Intel-FCA, the BMW part with which Aptiv has a separate partnership to provide a next generation radar and high-end vision sensor suite powered by their ADAS multi-domain controller.  Thus it is easy to see how Aptiv could benefit from the above described trends despite the fragmented and unclear competitive space.
  Valuation
  While we believe the real opportunity is long term, Aptiv currently  trades at a consensus forward PE of 18 and a good argument can be made for 20 based on sensor, connectivity, and cable companies like TEL and APH .  Their forward EV/EBITDA is 11.7 and they should probably get a little credit for only being a 15% tax payer.  The forward FCF yield is 3.5%.  So the company is not cheap, especially for an auto parts supplier, but one has to remember that they have low debt, good return on capital, and good growth prospects.  We feel somewhat guilty posting this idea to a value website but certainly you could find many growth companies that are significantly more expensive.
  Model Drivers
  Basically we think for the near term they can hit management’s guidance which will provide an acceptable return (the major potential upside comes in a few years as the mega-trends really get going).  This guidance assumes revenue growth consistent with previous MSD performance, and adjusted operating margins increasing from 12.5 to 14.2%.  This along with $350MM of buybacks per year (compared with ~$1B in FCF and a historically high buyback rate) results in EPS doubling in 5 years.
  Risks
  Macro / car cycle - Aptiv is an auto supplier and not insulated from the auto cycle which is often influenced by macroeconomic concerns.  One either has to not buy it now and try and time the cycle or just be ok with the risk.  We choose the latter.  Aptiv is somewhat insulated to regional swings by being truly global.  For example US SAAR declined last year as did Aptiv’s US revenue by 6%, but this was offset by 11% growth in Europe, 5% growth in Asia, and 26% growth in South America.
  Trends take longer to materialize - it could be that our core thesis is wrong and in five years there are no level 5 fully autonomous cars on the road and that EVs fail to gain meaningful adoption.  This would lead to slower than anticipated growth only in line with the overall auto market.
  Aptiv doesn’t benefit as much from these trends as expected - it is not impossible to envision a future where there are a few electric autonomous fleet managers, none of whom have chosen to buy many of Aptiv’s products to assemble their fleets, or Aptiv otherwise fails to take advantage of the trends they are targeting.  As discussed in the write up above, we believe this risk is somewhat mitigated by Aptiv’s working with all major OEMs and willingness to engage with partners with as much or little input from Aptiv as the customer prefers.
  We go completely to autonomous fleets and fewer cars are produced - perhaps the autonomous technology is so effective that people stop buying cars and instead utilize mostly autonomous mobility on demand services.  This could results in fewer cars being produced and lower revenue for Aptiv.  We think that both private ownership of cars and autonomous mobility on demand services will coexist for some time, certainly within our investment timeframe of five years, but it is a risk.  A partial mitigant is that if everyone switches to use the cars in these fleets they will see much more use and wear out faster, somewhat muting car volume declines.  Overall miles driven should increase as cost (whether in terms of one's own time or employing a drive) decreases.
I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.
Catalyst
Fully autonomous ride hailing systems are introduced in 2018 and 2019.  Significant numbers of mass-producible EVs are introduced in 2020 and 20101.

Star Gas was posted a couple of years ago by Oogum857.   Its still extraordinarily cheap and the business continues to improve.
  --------------
SGU (Star Gas Partners) is the largest retail heating oil distributer in the US.  It is extremely cheap trading just over 4x EBITDA and 6x FCF (including the seasonal WC release SGU trades at 3x EBITDA and 4x FCF).  The company pays a modest distribution now but is buying back shares and looking for ways to use its large (and growing) cash hoard.
Management is successfully migrating to a more stable, higher margin customer base.  The company has some economies of scale and ample growth prospects through its ability to buy competitors at cheap multiples.
---------------
  History:  Star Gas is the largest retail heating oil distributer in the US.  SGU grew through acquisitions and commanded a premium valuation until 2004 when significant hedging losses and a failed transition to a centralized call center cratered the stock price and earned management a famously scathing letter from Dan Loeb.  In 2005, SGU reorganized and recapitalized, replaced management, abolished its cash distribution, sold its higher margin propane business, and wrote off $69m of goodwill.  Shareholders sued (the lawsuit was dismissed but is awaiting judgment in appeals court) and without a dividend, the stock has languished under $5.
  Since 2006, SGU has generated significant EBITDA and FCF.  The company was reluctant to distribute cash while it stabilized operations and the recent spike and volatility in energy prices grew working capital requirements and increased customer risk.  SGU's dividend was reinstated in 09Q1.  Current Management is migrating to a higher credit and less price sensitive customer base and margins have grown from $.56 to $.87 per gallon from 2005 to now.  SGU's service and installation business improved significantly and contributed $8m gross over the LTM.

           Between the customer transition, volatility in the energy markets and recession, SGU has had some grizzly customer losses and churn (offsetting losses and gains).  However, customer metrics in the most recent quarter improved (net losses were only 2,600) while the company impressively maintained its pricing (heating oil prices tend to be sticky on the way down inflating margins, margins get squeezed as energy prices rise).  Management attributes some of the 2009 customer attrition to credit losses and talked about improving organic growth in some branches on the last call.  An improving economy and lower energy prices should continue to ameliorate the customer churn going forward.  Both Dan Donovan (CEO) and Rich Ambury (CFO) are longtime industry veterans, speak intelligently about the business and have done a good job balancing customer losses and margin growth to maximize cash.  I estimate that roughly 85% of SGU's costs are scalable limiting operating leverage.

         There were several other boosts to SGU in 2009 (SGU's fiscal year ends in September).  Last winter was significantly colder than two years ago.  In the current environment, heating oil has regained its historical price advantage to natural gas which, combined with the significant capital outlay required, should deter gas conversion.  SGU has historically lost roughly 50% of customers who move and home sales are down significantly.  SGU has $80m of NOLs still available.
  Analysts miss SGU because GAAP accounting is misleading in two ways.  1) SGU does not use hedge accounting and takes large (very, very large in 07-08) mark to market gains and losses on its derivative book.  The hedges are put in place as SGU negotiates fixed and capped price customers during the year and then offset (at expiry) the difference between the fixed or capped price of sales and the spot price at which SGU buys heating oil.  2) SGU should be looked at on a margin per gallon basis.  When prices exploded in 2008, revenue blew out while gross margins shrank (per gallon margins look small compared to bigger revenue base).  Revenue shrank and gross margins expanded as heating oil prices normalized.
  Follow the Cash:   As of 10Q1 (fiscal 09Q3), SGU had $99m of cash and $133m of long term debt (due 2013).  Cash has accumulated through operating FCF and the release of working capital as energy prices fell from peak levels two summers ago.  Winter is the height of SGU's working capital requirements (hedges, receivables and inventory) and at current heating oil prices I estimate that the seasonal WC release is worth ~$100m.  Adding the WC release to the balance sheet, SGU is trading at 3x EBITDA and 4x FCF.   SGU has a $290m credit facility that sits untouched and has also announced that they are now getting trade credit.       
  So, what is SGU going to do with all the cash?  Management is in the middle of a 7.5m (~10%) share buyback, raised the distribution by $.02 and called $50m of long term debt at a slight premium.   The debt buyback netted $5m a year in interest savings but was disappointing given the grossly undervalued equity.  
  There is the potential for a special dividend.  SGU is set up as an MLP where the GP is Kestrel Heat, a unit of Kestrel Energy Partners.  Kestrel is a small PE shop run by Paul Vermylen, the former president of Meenan Oil which was bought by Star Gas in 2001.  Kestrel's only other investment is Downeast LNG, a LNG import facility in Robbinston Maine that has not commenced construction, is mired in regulatory issues and lacks financing.  As the GP, Kestrel sets the board and manages Star Gas.  Kestrel also owns 17% of the LP or common.  The GP also gets a generous split of 90/10 (LP/GP) on any cash over $.0675 (per quarter) up to $.1125 (per quarter) and 80/20 pro rata above $.1125.  As part of the recapitalization signed in spring 2006, the GP agreed to use 50% of its share of excess distributions to fund a long term management incentive comp plan which allocates participation points to key management.  Vermylen and management also own small amounts of stock outright and bought this spring when prices were in the $2-3 range.
  Management has been equally conservative and opportunistic in using cash for acquisitions. There were only $3.9m in acquisitions in 2009 and $2.6m in acquisitions in 2008.  Management is rigorous about buying good businesses at low multiples (2.5-4x EBITDA and 4-5x FCF) and then slowly and carefully integrating.  Because of its relative size in a fragmented industry, there are few competing buyers when mom and pop businesses want to sell out.  Management has intimated that part of the reason for the cash hoard is the potential to make acquisitions and refresh the customer base.
  Growth and Economies of Scale:  As the largest player in a highly fragmented industry, SGU has several big advantages.  There are some economies of scale in the advertising, storage, delivery and hedging operations.  SGU also has the opportunity to make highly accretive acquisitions at low multiples.  As mentioned before, these are primarily mom and pop operators which rarely have competing buyers.  While management has been conservative making acquisitions and says it evaluates each business on a case by case basis, they generally buy businesses at 2.5 - 4x EBITDA (of course making acquisitions at those multiples means that SGU should be buying back shares).  Acquisitions are integrated slowly and SGU usually retains the acquisition's personnel and brand.
  Comps:  There are no other public heating oil distributers and the best comps for SGU are the propane distributors APU, FGP and SPH which trade at EBITDA multiples of 8-12x.   Propane is considered a slightly better business because of the more diversified customer base (SGU agreed to sell its propane business as part of the 2005 recap and will look to reenter this year as its non-compete expires). 
  Corporate Structure, MLP and Taxes:  SGU is a master limited partnership that sits directly above an operating C corp.  The C corp. pays federal and state taxes, but taxes have been offset by NOLs at the operating level.   Cash is dividended up to the parent in order to make cash distributions, pay a very small amount of corporate overhead, and make debt and unit repurchases.   Unit holders are taxed on the amount dividended up to the parent rather on the cash distributions.   However, the excess tax is eventually offset by a negative return of capital that writes up your cost basis when a unit holder goes to take capital gains.   In effect, because the SGU parent pays out less cash than it earns (dividends from the sub), you have a tax acceleration rather than the tax deferral intended by the MLP structure.  The tax difference was material in 2009 as the company bought back significant amounts of debt and stock, but should be smaller going forward.
  However, the company has no UBTI and will not have any UBTI going forward.   All of SGU's operations are related to heating oil distribution and qualify for tax exemption.   Worrying about UBTI is a little arcane when the operating company is paying taxes, but the absence of UBTI should make tax exempt investors more comfortable.   Even better, SGU is talking about ripping off the MLP structure, saving ~$500k - $1m in annual filing costs, harvesting ~$2m of deductions at the parent level, and making everyone's lives much, much easier.  My understanding is that this could be messy, but will only proceed in a case where there is no phantom income for unit holders.  In my discussion with CFO Rich Ambury he put the most probable timeline as next tax year (2011).
  Risks and Problems:  The largest risk is that continued customer attrition will outpace margin growth.  Although net attrition has slowed, the high level of churn makes it difficult to evaluate how successful management has been in migrating SGU's customer base.   Also, the significant sales lost to conservation may be sticky, similar to the late 1970s when customers permanently nudged their thermostats from 72 to 68.  Variance in yearly temperatures also leads to volatility in annual revenues. 
  Because SGU is unable to perfectly predict customer usage, it can't perfectly hedge.  SGU has to estimate how much and when it will actually need to deliver heating oil when it puts on its hedges during the year.  In the case when prices rise and demand exceeds expectations, SGU could find itself underhedged and forced to deliver heating oil at prices below which it can purchase it in the spot market.  Overhedging in a declining price environment is not as pernicious.  Only 14% of customers are on fixed price contracts hedged by swaps vs. 44% which are on capped price contracts where SGU can only lose the option premium on the downside.  Management has said that they are conservative with their hedging, buy extra calls to remain overhedged and build in excess margins on fixed and capped price customers.  A very rough back of the envelope calculation says that if heating oil prices rise by $1.00/gallon and SGU finds itself underhedged by 10% for the entire year (extreme conditions), SGU loses $19m.

Intro and Brief Thesis
I am recommending Copano Energy (CPNO) as a long. CPNO is a gathering and processing (G&P) company trading near a trough valuation that reflects market expectations of revenue and profit declines and a distribution cut. CPNO has a strong asset base, ample liquidity, a strong balance sheet, limited current dependence on natural gas (NG) and natural gas liquids (NGLs) prices, and built-in-growth for the next three years – which, at the least, will protect against a decline in the current business. Though CPNO trades in line with many of the smaller G&P master limited partnerships (MLPs), many factors differentiate CPNO.
  With a 23%+ dividend yield, a 138% dividend coverage ratio and 80% tax deferral, the company is providing great value to its shareholders/partners. Further, the company is structured as an LLC, not an MLP, so all future growth goes to the current shareholders. Perhaps the biggest margin of safety is derived from the fact that the built-in growth should more than offset any potential declines in the current business due to volume and price (NG and NGL) declines. Normalized distributable cash flow is greater than $3.00 per share. In that scenario, it is fairly easy to extrapolate the math and look two years out at a total return of 80 to 100%. The math is: 22 to 25% dividend yield (assuming no change from the current dividend) plus an increase in the stock price to the $14 to $17 range (which would imply a mid-teens yield on the stock). And, of course, this is mostly tax-deferred. Note that for a medium or high-grade junk bond, the required interest (yield) would need to be over 35% to match the current 23% CPNO yield.

Company and Industry Background
CPNO is a growth-oriented midstream energy company structured as a Limited Liability Company.  CPNO provides services to natural gas producers, including natural gas gathering, compression, dehydration, treating, transportation, processing and conditioning. As an LLC, there is no double corporate taxation and no separate general partner (GP) that receives half the profits above a certain threshold, This creates a lower cost of capital for its investors versus MLPs and corporations.   Further, unlike an MLP, the board is elected by unit-holders – so there is some sense of control by shareholders.   Further, a simple corporate structure enables the company to buy or be bought more easily in an industry ripe for consolidation.

As to natural gas usage, historically it has not declined materially in past downturns – though I am not assuming that now. Virtually all of the fields that Copano services are traditional wells, which require constant flow (by producers) to prevent permanent shut-in. Lifting costs for most of their fields are in the 1.70 to 3.00 per MCF range.
In an effort to keep this easier to parse through, the rest will be in outline structure.

What: The company has pipes running from the well-heads to their processing facilities and into the distribution system.
  Cash Flow Mix:
-          >55% is fee based
-          16% is keep-whole (KW) – where CPNO guarantees the producer a certain fee for its production based on its BTU (heat) content. CPNO then sells the production volumes for its own account taking all risk. The company uses simple hedging (through puts) and extra fees to cover their risk. The 10Q gives detailed information on the hedges – information that you can actually understand)
-          7% is percent of proceeds (POP) – the most exposed sector to pricing. To hedge out risk, the company buys puts as well
-          20% percent of liquids (POL) – also exposed to pricing and again hedged

Products - Typical breakdown of 1 unit of nat gas:
-          40% Ethane which is turned into ethylene for plastic bags and the like
-          30% Propane: 60% for heating, powering forklifts, etc. and 40% is for chemical feedstock
-          20% Butane – mostly used as octane enhancer for motor gasoline.
-          10% is natural Gasoline

Risks:
-          Volume declines: The key risk is that in a declining economy, volume demand will fall off forcing producers to cut back production (from current wells and new drilling projects). Prices for natural gas must also stay above the incremental lifting costs for production to remain economical. In Copano’s case, nat gas would need to fall another 40% to have a material impact on a large portion of their customers’ production rates. 
-          The location and type of production sources (geography and geology). In CPNO’s case, both are favorable – particularly on a relative basis
-          NGL Pricing - NGL’s compete directly with crude oil derived feedstocks – particularly for ethylene. Thus in a declining oil price environment, NGL prices have and will continue to come down. Again, CPNO hedges against this
-          Natural Gas Pricing: Evidently, this too impacts revenues and profits for CPNO and its peers when not dealing in fixed fee contracts.   Again, the company has hedged out much of this risk through puts on a significant portion of its forward production volumes out into 2010 as well as over half of the volume through 2011

Hedging:
-          They are currently hedged with product specific puts and swaps through 2011. 
-          Copano has no dirty hedges – where one hedges NGL risk through crude oil derivatives
-          Although it varies a bit product by product, for 2009 and 2010, CPNO is fully hedged against NGLs, 80% hedged against natural gas, and 80% hedged for non-ethane products. 
-          These hedges, for the most part, were locked in earlier this year when prices were inflated. 
-          For 2011, they are 50-60% hedged for 80% of production.
-          Counterparty risk is limited due to diverse group of counterparties. Hedges they have all privately arranged with Goldman, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and some with Morgan Stanley although very small portion.

Asset Base and Regional Exposure
-          Over 85% of operations are in non-shale. So they have very little exposure to the plays that are most susceptible to depressed pricing environment.

Liquidity demands, Debt and B/S strength
-          $550MM revolver with a rate of Libor +175 due October 1st 2012. Revolver is with BofA, JP Morgan and Wells Fargo, but they have 31 banks in total.
-          They have two senior notes totaling roughly $650 from May 2008 with avg. life of 8.5 yrs. Earliest is due in 2016
-          In good shape in terms of covenants, comfortably within their covenant range.
-          They have $174mm in cash and $345mm remaining on their revolver for a total of $519mm liquidity.
-          4Q08 capex is expected to be $30mm.
-          For 2009 the maximum capex they would spend is $180mm
-          2009E expansion capital is $70mm with an additional $110mm for McMullen Lateral Acquisition (the 150 mile Texas pipe). So total capex for 4Q08 and 2009 is $210mm and they have over $500mm in liquidity.
-          The McMullen acquisition requires FERC approval so 2009 capex spending could be significantly lower than this if FERC doesn’t approve the acquisition until the back-half of 2009. In that case, some of the capex for the acquisition would spill over into 2010
-          Have over $3.00 a share in cash, about that in the hedge book.

Valuation
-          The primary valuation metric for the MLP space is yield and the primary yardstick for this measurement is the difference between 10-Year Treasuries and the company yield. 
-          A common valuation technique in the industry is to divide a projected distribution, generally one year forward, by a distribution yield assumption and then apply a yield spread to 10-year Treasury to represent a risk premium. This way, the target unit price is equal to the projected distribution divided by the yield assumption. The yield assumption reflects the risks associated with achieving the distribution level, as well as the overall visibility of the partnerships ability to generate and grow cash flow. A partnership that has strong potential to grow the numerator (distribution), should trade at a lower yield than a partnership with less growth visibility.
-          For the past 18 years there was a strong correlation between the 10 year treasury yield and yields on MLPs (CPNO trades with MLPs) but recently the relationship has deteriorated. The spread between MLP yields (exGP) versus 10-Year Treasury securities averaged 258bps over an 18 year period and today the spread is 650bps, the highest it has ever been. CPNO’s spread is over 2000bps and many smaller MLPs have a yield similar to CPNO’s.
-          One way to value Copano would be to assume a reversion to the mean spread between G&Ps and the 10-Year Treasury. But in this credit environment, particularly for smaller players like CPNO, that is non-sensical. So, let’s assume the spread between the 10-Year Treasury and Copano’s yield comes in to 1300 basis points (13%) within the next two years, which is more than double the current and unprecedented 650bp mean spread between G&P yields and 10-Year Treasury securities, an investor would still realize a very attractive return. 
-          For example, if we conservatively assume by 2010 the spread between the 10-Year Treasury and Copano’s distribution yield comes in to 13% (650bp + 650bps) and we also conservatively assume Copano doesn’t grow distributions for the next two years, (current distribution is $2.28 and guidance is $3.00 for 2010), then Copano would trade at $14.39 ($2.28/15.1% = $15.10). Based on the current price of under $10, this is unit appreciation of roughly 54%. If you include the annual unit distributions from 2009 and 2010 of $2.28 each year, you have an additional $4.56 which brings your total (undiscounted) return to 111%.
-          Furthermore, Copano trades below P/B and well below net asset value. 
o        Historically, Copano has traded well above book value and even remained well above 3x book value from 2004 – 2007. Currently Copano trades at nearly half of book value
o        Book value is $19.07 and if Copano traded at 1x BV by 2010 and maintained distributions, an investors total return would be roughly 142% ({[$19.07 + $4.56] - $9.78} / $9.78)
-          Copano also trades well below a conservative estimate of NAV.
-          Copano’s NAV (which for the sake of the example I calculate as Total Assets, excluding Risk Mgmt. Assets and Intangibles, less Total Liabilities) is $660mm or $13.66 a share.
o        This is a 38% premium to the current valuation of $9.78.
o        If we assume Copano trades at $13.66 by 2010 and maintains distributions for the next two years, we have a total return of 85.3% ([$13.66 + $4.46] - $9.78} / $9.78)
-          While Copano appears undervalued based on the previously discussed measures, it is also at a fairly low valuation based on EV/EBITDA.
o        Copano currently trades at an EV/EBITDA multiple of 7.25x. This is a trough valuation based on historical company comps, but its still above the average trough valuations for the G&P names in past downturns. In the 2003, average G&P transaction multiples fell to EV/EBITDA multiples of around 6.25x and in 1992 they fell as low as 4.5x. It is highly unlikely Copano units would decline much lower than 6.3x EV/EBITDA due to the premium multiple they deserve for reasons presented earlier; however, at 6.3x EV/EBITDA, Copano would trade at $7.00. This is a 28% downside.
-          So, if we assume a 28% downside and roughly 100% upside (an average of all three valuation methods) we have a fairly attractive reward:risk ratio of roughly 3.5:1. Recall this is all based on the assumption that Copano maintains a distribution of $2.28, despite guiding toward a $3.00 distribution in 2010.

What the market is missing
-          Built-in-growth in North Texas (cryogenic plant coming online in 2Q’09), Oklahoma and Cantera acquisition in Rockies (backlog of completed wells now being connected)
-          McMullen acquisition should boost to earnings. This is a 150 mile pipe with gas already on it. The pipe will take gas to Houston Central without relying on Kinder Morgan
-          CPNO has THREE different processing modes, one of which is conditioning mode:
o        Full Recovery: (Texas and Oklahoma) – If the value of recovered NGLs exceeds the fuel and gas shrinkage costs of recovering NGLs (this is most profitable mode, but they need a positive spread between the cost basis (nat gas) and the product (NGLs)
o        Ethane Rejection: (Texas and Oklahoma) – If the value of ethane is less than the fuel and shrinkage costs to recover ethane (in Oklahoma, ethane rejection at Paden plant is limited by nitrogen rejection facilities)
o        Conditioning Mode: (Texas) – Copano has the ability to go into conditioning mode at their Houston Central Plant (this will also be available at the St. Joe plant in North Texas when completed), which enables them to limit losses on their G&P business
-          Volumes more resilient than most G&Ps because many of their producers can’t take volumes and shut them in due to the nature of their fields – else they risk permanent shutdown
-          The current price is implying the company cannot grow as demonstrated above
-          The current price also implies a distribution cut despite recent management confirmation of distribution increases
-          With its hedges and ability to move between full recovery, ethane rejection and conditioning mode, the company is not a typical G&P company yet is priced that way

Management
-          CEO and founder owns 10% of company
-          Highly incentivized
-          Board elected by unit-holders.
-          Board is also completely independent. The board was chosen through rigorous interview process. They interviewed people with no ties to the company or management.

Summary of Risks
-          Volume growth in North Texas, Oklahoma and Rockies (Cantera Acquisition) is significantly less than the company has projected.
-          Cut 2010 unit distribution guidance of $3.00 – apparently well-built-in..
-          Rising interest rates
-          All operations in shale (although limited to less than 15% of business) cease due to depressed commodity price environment.
-          FERC doesn’t approve acquisition of 150 mile pipe to Houston Central.
-          Volumes decline due to unforeseeable events such as weather.
-          The company continues to do more acquisitions – accretive or not – that stretch the balance sheet going into what could be a prolonged economic downturn.
Catalyst
- Production stays at a reasonable level and revenues and profits continue to grow – even if at a snail’s pace

- The above would push the stock back to mid-teens which could enable them to do accretive acquisitions which could create further upside",32.82208717578119,65.03067311173699,144.37628089044318,159.20246496538834,-9.418917809914609,6.649260276384479,29.566837962264515,25.981698157832277

Summary Thesis
The regional bank ETF (KRE) has begun to rally lately, but is still only up 8% in the past year, vs. the S&P up 17%.  With a vaccine, there remains material upside among financials, particularly as the economic cycle returns to growth in 2021. With a stimulus bill lined up, and the Fed keeping rates low, we see the backdrop for a steepening yield curve in place. Throw in diminishing loan loss provisions, and conditions appear ripe for bank fundamentals to improve dramatically.
  They are still very cheap too. The S&P at 23x 2021 earnings is stretched, but many banks trade at 9-13x earnings, record high 40-50% discounts to the market. With good cash flow and solid long term loan growth characteristics, many smaller banks appear to be a good trade.
  We screened through about 100 regional and community banks, and came up with Financial Institutions (FISI) out of New York, as it boasts a combination of 1) solid ROE’s at 11% over the past 3 years, 2) management who favors organic growth, 3) positive profits in 2008 and 2009, and 4) still trades at only 8.9x 2021 earnings.
Given their loan deposit ratio (82%), and the improving rate/NIM picture, this seems a classic case of the market ascribing a trough multiple on trough earnings.  Before the pandemic, FISI typically traded at a 14.4x earnings multiple.
FISI has never been written up on VIC.
The company saw at least half a dozen insiders buying shares this year, with zero insider sales, and also intends to buy back 5% of the outstanding shares over the next year. 
Their track record is pretty good back to 2004:
In sum, based on what we expect of roughly $3.13 in EPS in 2022, and using a comp multiple of 12x, we calculate upside potential to $37 per share, which with dividends works out to almost 50% upside over the next 12-18 months. Given that clean earnings in Q4 (tax adjusted, excluding one time items), was $0.75, the $3 case for earnings seems quite doable.
  Our bull scenario is one whereby loan loss provisions drop to under 2019 figures, as the company has over-reserved for losses, and at 13x the stock trades to $45. 
  Our downside case is $20.
  Capitalization
The company’s capital ratios are solid. Tier 1 capital is 10.6% as of September 2020, and their leverage ratio is 8.25%. These have remained steady for the past five years.
  In late 2008, the Fed force fed all US banks TARP capital in the form of preferreds. FISI accepted $37.5mm of prefs. They repaid that in 2011 with a $40mm equity offering that was 25% dilutive.
  Had TARP not been forced on the company, the company could have built up the capital needed in a couple of years. EPS would have shown even better long term growth too. The five-year EPS growth rate (2014-2019) was 8.2%, which is pretty good.
  History
The predecessor to Financial Institutions (FISI) is Five Star Bank (formerly Wyoming County Bank), founded in the 1850’s. Wyoming Bank merged with a couple other smaller banks, changed names and went public in 1999 at $15 per share. That was 11x earnings at that time.
  Right out of the gate, FISI acquired a few regional players, and with a de-centralized and yet aggressive lending strategy, got into trouble. Loans almost doubled from 1999 to 2002, but poor underwriting led to issues. With a big agricultural loan book at the time, FISI also struggled when milk prices collapsed.
  By 2003, FISI was forced to revamp their lending practices and improve their underwriting. Operations became more centralized, lending officers better trained and a Chief Risk Officer was put in place.
  Revenue stagnated during that time, for three years, and EPS fell from $2.23 in 2002 to a low of $0.28 in 2005. But an improved underwriting team fixed their loan quality issues, and by 2008 and 2009, led to solid loan performance despite the Great Recession. FISI got smart in time to avoid subprime lending and the no document loans that plagued much of the industry.
  As mentioned above, FISI did take TARP money, and paid the price of dilution to redeem them. But since then, the company has run a tight ship from an underwriting perspective.
  The original CEO, Peter Humphrey, served in that role from 1983 until retiring in 2012. The “new” CEO, Marty Birmingham, then took over and has stuck to the company’s core rural lending businesses, as well as growing from a rural bank and one with a growing presence in Rochester and Buffalo (their headquarters are located almost exactly between them).
  They have done a few very small deals:
  SDN was acquired in 2014, and offers insurance brokerage services for customers.
  Courier Capital and HPN Capital were small transactions in 2016 and 2018 respectively, and offer private wealth management services.
  Management is quite focused on adding more valuable and stable, fee-based revenue.  Recently in fact FISI announced another small deal to buy a Rochester based insurance broker.  Terms were not disclosed.
  Business
Today, the company operates 47 branches (down from 53, as some are being consolidated this year). Some key facts:
  The company’s loan book is divided into three main categories.
    Commercial loans are the biggest category, at $2.0BB as of the end of December. That is 56% of the total, with $1.2BB of that related to secured, mortgage loans.
    Consumer Indirect is category number 2, with $840mm of loans outstanding (24% of the total). These are auto loans, but nothing material in the subprime category. The average FICO score of their auto loans (made via partnerships with local car dealers), is 723.
  The company has been de-emphasizing their indirect lending since the end of 2018, when the auto lending space got pretty overheated. They also are more focused on direct relationship lending. Knowing their customer that is. Overall, the company has been in this business since 2005, with a very solid track record. Today, management has commented that they like spreads today, and it could be a driver of better loan yields in 2021.
  Residential real estate lending is the third biggest lending category at just under 20% of total loans. This is a solid business, with high quality borrowers (769 FICO scores), and growing 6.2% per year over the past five years. The company experienced limited losses in 2008-9, and to date has only $6mm of mortgages on a deferral program, out of a total of $691mm (under 1%).  There is refi risk here, but overall this is a much smaller portion of the balance sheet than it would be at most smaller banks.
  Rounding out the company’s balance sheet is $807mm of securities (publicly traded Agency bonds for the most part). With loan yields at 4.25% today compared to securities yielding 2.4%, the company has been migrating capital away from securities and into loans, particularly on the commercial side. This has helped offset net interest margin pressures.
  Below is a chart of NIM over the past decade, including Q3.
NIM has remained quite stable since 2015. Even in Q4 2020, NIM was only down 8 bps, but largely driven by lower NIM PPP loans.  In 2020, guidance suggests that it will remain flat. At this point, there is likely only upside to interest margins.  Any whiff of inflation that pushes the 10 year higher, with the Fed keeping the short end low, and banks could rally significantly.  
  In 2009, the company’s loan portfolio performed admirably, but at the time FISI owned a portfolio of agency equities and preferreds, and took a hit on that.  Today their securities portfolio only owns Agency backed bonds (with no equities).
  Here is a chart of loans ($ in millions) going back 10 years, with an annual growth of 10% per year.
Given the lack of losses in 2020, with 2020 EPS $2.11, underwriting looks fine.
  Asset Quality
Banks in general are trading at still large discounts to the market multiples based on loan worries (and lack of growth, only growth stocks performing). 
  Unemployment is the biggest driver to delinquency levels, and with unemployment levels extremely elevated, defaults seem guaranteed.
  Overall, it appears that FISI is pretty conservatively booking reserves for loan losses.
Above is our math on how much the company has set aside to cover future loan losses ($52.4mm).  Compared to non-performing loans, allowances are a very conservative 420%. I consider anything over 120% to 130% to be “good,” so these are conservative on the surface. If we add in loans on a deferral program ($90mm, as it has come down from $99 as of December per management) plus NPLS of $12mm, then we have $102mm of total potentially problematic loans.
  First of all, as a percentage of total loans, only 2.9% of loans are either deferred or non-performing, with most of that from their loan deferral program. The good news is that loan deferrals totaled $525mm (16%) as of June 30, but today are only $90mm (2% of loans outstanding).
  If we assume 60% default rates and 60% recoveries, then we get loan losses of $37mm.  Against $52 in allowances, the odds look pretty good for reserve releases in 2022.
  We honestly have no idea how defaults shake out, but we make the point that assuming employment levels continue to improve, the company is well reserved for future losses in their loan book.
  On the Q3 call, management actually stated that had they followed their quantitative models (which are heavily tied to unemployment levels), then they would have released reserves. That is, they would not have booked $4.0mm in provisions for loan losses (which hit the income statement of course). 
  Western New York Economy
There is regional risk investing in a bank based in Western New York. But over time, the economy there has continued to grow, housing is quite affordable, and unemployment quite similar to that of the broader US economy.
GDP Growth Since 2002
Unemployment Data
At 7.5% unemployment in December in Western NY, it is a bit higher than the US average.  As of October it matched the US, but generally over time it has followed national trends. 
  The economy is pretty diversified, and Cornell projects that the population will remain flat over the next five years in Western New York.
  This report suggests that 10 out of the biggest 12 industries in Western NY experienced job growth over the past 5 years.  Many of these are in industries poised to recover.
2021 Guidance
The company gave very specific line by line guidance for 2021. They assumed no steepening in the yield curve (NIM’s constant at 3.13%), loan growth of 5%, and growth in non-interest income in the low single digits.
As for expenses, management also guided to $112mm for the year ($27-29mm per quarter), which is 2% higher than 2020. Overall, FISI expects their efficiency ratio to range between 57-58% for 2021. Banks below 60% in this environment I consider well run. With Q4 Efficiency ratios at 56%, this seems pretty doable, and perhaps beatable with any NIM improvement.
The big question mark for 2021 will be provisions for loan losses. They guided to charge-offs of 35-40 basis points as a percentage of loans outstanding. So, if we assume loans grow 5%, then charge-offs in 2021 probably hit $15mm.
On the Q4 call the CEO said,
""The challenge with -- so no, we didn't provide any specific guidance on provision. We just stuck with Charge-offs. And, the reason is, the same story that we've had this year is, tell me what our unemployment forecasts are going to look like. And tell me what's going to happen with the pandemic. And I can probably do a little bit of a better job, predicting the CECL model outcomes. It's a really tough thing to predict. I, I am very comfortable with where our ratios are right now, from a coverage perspective, from a reserve perspective. But, that doesn't necessarily mean that what happens next year, relative to modeled outcomes and CECL, that doesn't necessarily mean we're going to stay at that reserve level. We could be driven to increase it depending on what happens with economic forecasts. And we could be driven to bring it down depending on what happens to those forecasts. So it's just a really difficult thing to predict. So we've chosen to sort of give you some guidance relative to charge-offs, but haven't really talked much about what's going to happen to the overall provision or allowance.""
So, they don’t know. But with vaccines rolling out, and delinquencies actually declining in Q4 (from $13.9mm in Q3 to $12.5mm), the trend is going in the right direction.
Now, loan deferrals remain elevated, at $99mm in Q4, but “lower today” per the company (we assume they are $90mm). Assuming a 60% recovery on 60% of that defaulting, then that implies total loan losses of $37mm. With reserves now built to $52mm, it seems pretty likely that provisions are not going higher.
That said, we assumed losses at the elevated Q4 runrate for all of 2021.
That still gets us $2.86 in EPS for 2021.
For 2022, we assume that provisions fall from $22mm to $12mm. In 2018 and 2019, loan loss provisions were around $8-9mm. So we think 2022 looks conservative.
That gets us $3.13 in EPS for 2022.
Here is our model annually. There hasn’t been a Street EPS update since Q4 figures were reported, so current estimates appear far too low at $2.55 in 2021 EPS.
Our income statement is below:
  Community Banks Comps
  On average, these comps today trade at 11.1x 2021 earnings, and 11.3x 2022 earnings (using median).
  M&T Bank (MTB) is based in Buffalo, but with $79BB in assets, is 20x bigger than FISI. It trades at 12x 2021 earnings, and at a 3.1% dividend yield, seems like a potential buyer of the company at some point.
  Historically FISI has traded at a sub 3% dividend yield. Today it is 4.1%, not because of dividend cut concerns, but simply as the market remains wary of banks and value equities.
  FISI tends to trade at 14.4x earnings, looking back 5 years pre pandemic.
  At 8.9x 2021 and 8.1x 2022, FISI is 30% cheaper than peers today, and well below is normalized trading level.
  Here is our valuation on a P/B basis as well as on a P/E basis:
  Big picture, we assume:
1. 5% loan growth over the next 3-5 years, plus
2. Share repurchases taking out 2-3% of shares annually, plus
3. Cost cutting of 1% per year.
  That implies 6-8% EPS growth long term.  Runrate EPS is $3.00 (from Q4), a reasonable estimate perhaps for the next few months, pre-vaccine. A 13-14x multiple or 1.2x book multiple seems reasoble for 7% earnings growth, double digit ROE bank with takeout potential.
  The company has a buyback plan to purchase 5% of the share base over the next twelve months.
Insider buying has also been impressive in 2020, with the CEO and a handful of executives picking up 13,000 shares in the open market back in May (between $18.50 and $19.50).

  Amazon is the largest online retailer and cloud computing provider in the world. By offering customers the most selection, lowest prices and most convenience, Amazon has established market leadership in online retailing, a secularly growing industry that Amazon should lead for many years given its scale, delivery and logistics footprint, installed Prime subscription membership base, and trusted brand. Amazon has leveraged its 1P online retail platform to develop new and growing business, with Advertising and Marketplace being the largest. Advertising and Marketplace likely generate triple the operating margins of first party retail given the low marginal cost of delivering an ad unit, and the fee-based model for marketplace. At scale, mass market retailing is a high return on capital and durable business given that once a retailer has entrenched its position as the provider with the best selection, prices and convenience, customers are likely to become loyal, repeat purchasers, thereby reducing customer acquisition costs. With the largest revenue and customer base, Amazon is able to reinvest more resources into its supply chain, logistics network, Prime member benefits, and user experience, thereby driving more customer value.
              Amazon’s Cloud business, AWS, is the leading provider of cloud computing services, including compute, data, storage, security and a variety of applications that a growing number of enterprises perform in the cloud. With a seven-year headstart, and nearly 40% market share, Amazon has been able to scale AWS’s physical footprint and services faster than competitors.
              Cloud computing services are an increasingly essential, non-discretionary services for the enterprise. Once a business has moved its digital footprint to Amazon’s cloud, the business is likely to be sticky, recurring and durable. Cloud services are mission critical and cannot be easily moved or changed without business disruption. Because it is still early in the shift of enterprise IT spending to the cloud, AWS should continue to grow its revenue between 30-40% per year for the foreseeable future, as the IT spending continues to shift to the cloud. Globally, IT spending is a multi-trillion dollar market.
               AWS is already generating high operating profit ($13B/$45B in sales/28.8% operating margin) which should be sustainable as AWS’s continues to leverage its physical fixed cost footprint and add new high-value services to its product offering. From 2015-2020, AWS revenue increased from $7.8B to $45B, while operating profit increased from $1.5B to $13.5B.
              Amazon has predicted that AWS can become the largest business inside of Amazon, implying a revenue base that can grow much larger than the +$50B in sales that AWS will generate in 2021.
              Amazon is one of the most trusted and shopped brands in the world. 70% of product searches in the U.S. online begin on Amazon; Prime is the largest subscription business in the world, and Amazon has captured 50% market share in online retail. Amazon’s low prices, convenience, selection and dependable delivery have cemented its position as the leading online retailer. Customers can shop almost anywhere; the fact that they continue to choose Amazon proves its value proposition to consumers.
              AWS allows customer to save money, scale faster, and develop and implement more advanced applications and services. AWS customers trust Amazon with their most sensitive data, and often architect their technological infrastructure to work specifically with AWS. AWS has built and deepened these relationships globally, across all size and type of enterprise.
              Amazon has a history of putting customers first. Customer reviews, free shipping with Prime, Kindle, Alexa, are also examples of non-obvious new product and services that have won customer love and trust by providing value, and convenience or an improved shopping experience. The accumulation of inventive, consumer-facing products and services has made Amazon one of the strongest consumer franchises in the world.
              Like Walmart before it, Amazon leverages its scale and negotiating power to drive better terms for itself, and for customers. This has created some friction between various constituencies in the Amazon ecosystem (suppliers/publishers/third-party sellers). As Amazon’s market power has grown, so too has the tension with a suppliers/actors that are reliant on the Amazon platform to distribute product or reach customers. 
              Inspired by founder and long-time CEO Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s culture is defined by a invention and innovation, customer-obsession., long-term thinking, and operational excellence. Few companies practice their cultural values as fully and consistently as Amazon as evidenced by its long-history of bold innovation, its customer-centric product and service offerings, its development of new large businesses that required long-term investment and patience, and its operational excellence as measured by leadership in online delivery and scaling of the cloud. Amazon’s culture, combined with its scale and financial resources, provide a strong competitive advantage because Amazon is willing and able to make investments against long-term horizons, that may not yield profits, at greater scale, than almost any company in the world. Crucially, Amazon does not get distracted with side projects that are immaterial to a company’s of Amazon’s size. Amazon has been ingenious at leveraging its existing asset base to create new, large and profitable adjacent businesses (marketplace/advertising/Amazon Video).
              Amazon is competitive with any company in the world at attracting and retaining top technology talent, a position that will be increasingly important as advanced technologies such as AI/Machine learning become more essential to businesses.
              Amazon is trading at 3.3x Sales, 21.9x EBITDA, and 65x E2021 Earnings. From 2016 to 2020, Amazon grew sales from $135B-$386B, EBITDA increased from $12.3B to $48B, and EPS increased from $4.90-$41.83. The inherent operating leverage in retail, and growing revenue and profit contribution from higher margin revenue segments (AWS/Advertising/Marketplace) have driven substantial operating leverage.  
              Over the next five years, Amazon should be able to compound revenue growth at 20-30% per year given the continued secular shift to online retail, growth of new large verticals such as grocery and pharmacy, and cloud revenue growth. From 2016-2020, Amazon grew revenue between 20-35% per annum. Assuming Amazon’s revenue multiple remains constant, the compound revenue growth will approximate the market value growth. For reference, Amazon’s trades at a lower multiple of revenue than large technology peers (Alphabet: 5.6x; Apple: 5x; Shopify 30x);
              It is quite possible that Amazon’s retail business currently represents the majority of the value of company. Amazon’s retail business generated $340B in revenue in 2020. If the retail business can grow at revenue at 20% per annum through 2025, retail will generate $846B in revenue in 2025 At a 10% pre-tax margin, Amazon’s retail business would generate $80B in profit. At a 25x multiple, the retail business alone would be worth $2T, or about $1.3T discounted at 10%. Given the entire business is valued at $1.5T today, an investor is paying $200B, or 4x sales, for AWS, a very attractive valuation for a dominant global digital platform with market leadership and one the largest addressable markets in the world.
              Conversely, the downside should be relatively protected at current valuation (i.e. $3000/share/$1.5T market value). In 2021, Retail should generate $400B in sales and AWS should generate $55B in sales. At 3x sales for retail ($1.2T) and 10x Revenue for AWS ($550B), Amazon’s valuation would be $1.7T, or $3333/share. These multiples are reasonable given the growth rate, competitive position, global scale, and essential, recurring revenue of each business.
              Over the next several years, Amazon’s earnings power will also benefit from a growth in advertising and marketplace, two businesses that may earn 30-40% operating margins at scale based on peer margins. It is possible that by 2024, Marketplace (3P) will generate $150B in revenue and Advertising will be at $50B in revenue=$200B in revenue ex anything from 1P retail/physical stores. A 35% blended EBIT margin is not unreasonable given the margins on scaled marketplaces/digital advertising businesses, which would result in $70B in EBIT; that earnings stream could be worth 20x EBIT, or $1.4T.
              The flywheel on marketplace + advertising is remarkable. More buyers=more sellers=more valuable advertising inventory. It is not clear why Amazon's advertising business can't reach $100B in revenue. One challenge of high-value advertising businesses is to keep customer attention at scale--historically, new technologies have disintermediated dominant advertising mediums--this is especially true with media (newspaper/print magazine/television). Another risk is that high-value advertising is hit-driven. Scaled media-supported advertising businesses are incredibly profitable, but not easy to defend over the long-term. The businesses are also economically sensitive. The network effects businesses have a different risk--which is the network unwinds. The risk is maybe greater here when the network does not control supply-i.e UGC content-the switching cost are arguably low (that is certainly debatable) and the competition for attention (Instagram/Twitter/Snap) is fierce.
              Amazon does not seem to have those problems. The advertising moat is supported by the online retail dominance--which is reinforced by a level of scale and tangible capital investment that would be almost impossible to recreate. This scale and capital allows Amazon to have the most selection and the fastest delivery to the most customers. The advertising moat is also reinforced by the best online shopping experience i.e. most reviews/best personalization. That moat is also deep and getting deeper. To the extent that the advertising business is sustained and defended by Amazon's advantages in online retail (70% of product searches start on Amazon/Prime Member base/supply chain and logistics) AND the advertising model is valuable given commercial intent, quality of ad formats and targeting----it's not clear what the constraints on Amazon's advertising business are (other than risks associated with 3P marketplace over time i.e. competing with sellers). Given that Marketplace and Advertising are potentially triple the operating margins of 1P retail, Amazon will not have a lot of incentive to compete with 3P sellers if that meant upsetting the apple cart.
              Amazon has several other unique advertising advantages, Prime Video being a huge one. Prime Video is a global internet television service, moving deeper into live and sports. That advertising pool is large. And I don't know how Twitch or Alexa will factor in, but both could be drivers over time.     
              Lastly, an entire ecosystem of advertising is developing around marketplace--agencies are being built purely to help 3P sellers sell on Amazon--and PE/Strategics are acquiring 3P sellers to create modern online CPG conglomerates (i.e. Thrasio). The more sophisticated and developed the ecosystem--probably the more entrenched the advertising can become. I don't think Amazon's valuation today takes into account the possibility of advertising reaching $100B
              Amazon has dominant scale in two relatively economically insensitive and essential categories: retail and cloud. No matter economic or market conditions, customers will need to buy a wide array of essential products from Amazon, including a growing assortment of staples. In a difficult economy, it is entirely possible that Prime’s value proposition will become more attractive for cost-conscious consumers. AWS’s cloud services are akin to electricity—it is last likely one of the last services that an enterprise would or could eliminate. Cloud customers often sign multi-year contracts and are increasingly independent on AWS to support core businesses functions.

Have you been buying during this market decline and need a good short?  Oh yes, we all do.  Let’s try this: Would you buy shares in an oil company trading at 13x forward FCF, with production declining 3-5%/year, no capital spending on exploration and thus near zero reserve replacement?  I didn’t think so.  I am recommending a short sale of Permian Basin Royalty Trust (NYSE: PBT), which is trading as though oil & gas are priced at $100/barrel and $11/mcf when in fact they are trading at $65, and $7 respectively.  I think oil will stay under $75 until the catalyst (dividend cuts), and you’ll do fine with all the cheap things you own elsewhere on a relative basis.  However, if you are concerned about oil and gas bouncing, I recommend a long position in a far cheaper, similar upstream producer. For example, take a look at Oxy trading at 7-8x forward discretionary cash with better reserves and growth potential and a solid chemicals biz.   

Permian Basin Royalty Trust (NYSE:PBT) owns a net overriding royalty interests in the famous Permian Basin (Waddell Ranch), and a group of properties scattered around the rest of the Republic of Texas (Texas Royalty properties).  The Trust was created in 1980 in an attempt to finance development of said oil assets, by giving investors an opportunity to participate directly in the project economics, without having to worry about the re-investment of the cash flow into other projects.  The trust has no employees and simply receives monthly checks from the field operators, which are then distributed to shareholders, and taxed as ordinary income, minus a small depreciation credit at the individual level.  Hence, it is a classic pass-thru entity that trades on the NYSE.  

Structure of the Royalty arrangements:

    Royalty income consists of the amounts of hydrocarbons sold by the field operators burdened by the net overriding royalty interests (Royalties) due to the trust from the sale of said production less accrued production costs, development and drilling costs, applicable taxes, operating charges, and other costs and deductions multiplied by 75% in the case of the Waddell Ranch properties and 95% in the case of the Texas Royalty properties.  Or put mathematically:

Well Head Revenues – Excise & Property Taxes – Operating Costs – CapX = Net FCF

Unit Holder Royalties = 75% * Net FCF.

    Royalties are taxable to the holder at the income tax rate, as the IRS considers PBT a passive entity that just collects the checks, and the unit holder is considered a business entity.  Hence you too can be an oil company by just buying units of PBT!  There is a small depletion/depreciation tax credit, but b/c the properties are mature and the book cost basis is so low its negligible.

Please reference the following spreadsheet: http://www.geocities.com/doobadoo1/PBT.xls

Built-in Terminal Declines:
    The 2 royalty properties are now in terminal decline (water-flooding), with oil production rates declining 3-5%/year and gas remaining steady for now (but declines will begin soon and be sharper as the field managers are spending little on capx).  For example, 2007 CapX for Waddell Ranch was only ~$6/barrel of production (and less than $1/proved boe), which largely includes the costs of work-overs and a handful of infill wells drilled (10 wells).  The field managers of Waddell planned to 2x that in this year but so far CapX is running at only $3 mil annualized compared, to $11 mil last year.  Looks like they abandoned further drilling.  

    Take a look at my graph of oil production for Waddell Ranch in Culbertson County, TX.  Declines like these are not reversible, especially with so little capital investment.  In fact the decline rates were double digits in the years after the oil bust of 1998, when CapX was cut to nil.  The drilling programs from 2002-2007 helped initially lift production, but now we have returned to a 3-5% decline rate, which will accelerate now that all drilling activity has ceased.    The situation with the Texas Royalty Properties is similar.. You can’t fight geology, and the lack of drilling when prices were north of $90 suggests that there is nothing left to do in Culbertson County.  Oxy on the other hand is projecting 5-8% production growth for several years.

Misleading Accounting (Rising Prices Masking Declines):
    If you look at the monthly releases for PBT, it suggests that production is going up, as royalties net to the trust are rising.  This has to do with the silly way that the trust reports.  You see, being a ‘royalty trust’ they report net royalties ‘in-kind.’  Net of what?  Net of the amounts of hydrocarbons needed to be sold at market to cover the field operator’s expenses and capital expenditures.   In 2008, UNDERLYING production is falling, but the price of oil & gas was up, whilst the cost of lifting a barrel of oil remained steady at around $8/bbl.  Thus, if 10 boe is produced and sold for $80/bbl, the royalty paid to the trust would be reported as 9 boe, as 1 boe would be sold to cover opex.  However, if you double the price of oil to $160 and ran the same math, only ½ of a bbl of oil would need to be sold to cover opex, so royalties to the trust would be reported as 9.5 boe even though underlying production remained the same.  In the case of PBT, oil production on the underlying properties is down ~4% so far in 2008, while prices were up, and CapX was down.  Thus, it appears as though production is growing, but in reality you are just witnessing the phenomenon known as operating leverage.

    This same phenomenon exists when the trust reports its reserves in its annual 10K, as remaining reserve estimates appear to be rising sharply.  The petroleum engineer uses underlying production and a future price assumption based on year end strips, to calculate how many boe of hydrocarbons must be sold to cover costs, and then reports how many boe is due to the trust in total over the remaining life of the fields.  Therefore, the number 1 driver for year-to-year reserve ‘revisions’ is the increase/decrease in the prices of oil and gas.  Extensions and discoveries are much smaller: these are mature fields being water flooded.  Its very evident if you pull the K’s from ’01, where reserves were written down dramatically with the fall of oil and gas prices during the last recession.

Valuation:
    On a trailing basis PBT is trading for a 11.7% yield or roughly 8.5x distributed earnings.  Of course this distribution is largely taxable as OI, and is not directly comparable to a company like Oxy trading a 5x trailing fully taxed eps, which as a shareholder you pay 15% on the ultimate dividends and capital gains.  Nonetheless, those earnings were for prices of oil above $100 and natural gas above $10.  In the current regime of $65 oil and $7 gas, PBT is trading for ~13x taxable distributions (7.7% yield) and Oxy for ~8x earnings.  PBT is way over valued.

    Don’t take my word for it; let’s pull the PV10 valuation from the independent reservoir engineers.  Using a 10% discount rate, the Dec 31. ’07 reserve balances and oil and gas prices of $100 and $10 respectively, the independent petroleum engineers value PBT’s royalty interests at ~$450 mil.  Using today’s oil and gas prices would yield a PV10 value of about $300 mil ($9.60,/share, $6.40/share respectively).  But who cares what some ‘experts’ think, you want to know what doobadoo thinks, right?

    I’ll go ahead and play petrochemical engineer banker and do my own valuation of PBTs assets, eh?  Using a light discount rate of 8.5%, and assuming cost inflation of 3%, $65 oil, $7 gas, and low single digits declines I get a valuation of ~$11/unit for PBT. You can view my DCF of the DCF tab of my posted spread-sheet.

Catalyst: Dividend Cuts:

It will take about 2 months for the current pricing environment to flow through to the dividend, as production and royalty distributions trail by a few months.  I am projecting $.13/share dividend at current oil & gas prices.  If you are concerned about oil & gas spiking I recommend buying some Occidental Petroleum, as 2/3 of their upstream comes from the Permian Basin (same as PBT.)  In fact, Oxy’s properties in the Permian are located a stone’s throw to the north of Culbertson County.  Oxy is cheap on an upstream basis, and it looks like you get the chemicals biz for nearly nothing.  But then again there are plenty of cheap things to buy.  I think you can just short PBT, and call it a year.

  Lululemon Athletica - Short - (COMP:LULU)
1.25.2010 / $29.14
  Lululemon Athletica (""LULU"" or ""Lululemon"") is priced for perfection at current levels (16x FYE 1/31/2012 EBIT, 24x EPS).  The market believes that current metrics and margins will apply through full penetration, which is increasingly unlikely given (i) new competitors in the yoga space and (ii) sustained gaps in US store productivity (due partly to (i) today's economic climate and (ii) the presence of new competitors).  The biggest risk here relates to timing and the stock's technicals (17% of float is sold short / 10 days to cover).  I think ~$20 (30%+ return) is a reasonable target price, as the market realizes that current metrics and margins are unsustainable and the equity is repriced.  I would not be surprised to see sizable insider selling after Q409 earnings (Advent International, a 7% shareholder, could sell their remaining stake given the stock's performance and valuation, and the fact that they are approaching a five year hold on this investment).

    Investment Thesis
Operating Metrics are Unsustainable - LULU is a best-in-breed retailer, with industry-leading metrics and returns across the board (50% gross margin, $1,450 in comp sales per square foot, high 20% ROE).  I believe these metrics are unsustainable as they grow their store base into the smaller markets needed to reach ~300 North American stores, or ~250+ in the US.  Retailers & apparel makers are entering the yoga market through (i) tuck-in acquisitions (Athleta, Lucy) or (ii) new brand extensions (Addidas).  Competitors' products are good and getting better, and are usually priced at meaningful discounts (for those not familiar with LULU, the Company's core product is the $98 Groove Pant).  A few notes on competitors are listed below (please note that I am still digging for new info relating to competition). 
Lucy - a high-end retailer focused on women's yogawear, operating 60 stores in the US.  Lucy generates ~$65mm in revenue and plans to grow revenue at a 30% CAGR (VF plans to increase the store base to ~200).  Lucy stores have a similar feel when compared with LULU, although products are priced at a discount and do not have the same cachet.  VF's backing and expertise in brand development suggest Lucy could become a formidable competitor over time.
Addidas / Nike / UnderArmour - Addidas owns two brands through (i) Addidas by Stella McCartney, a new line launched in 2005, and (ii) Addidas' house yoga brand.  Stella is focused on high-end technical products, leveraging technical expertise from Addidas' Clima365.  Stella's products are marketed to very high-end customers (who associate the Stella brand with Tracy Anderson, a personal trainer for the stars who also promotes Stella products), at price points generally above LULU products.  Addidas' house brand offers the same Clima365 technology as the Stella line, but at a lower price point.  Nike has not made such a concerted effort, but has developed yogawear under the Nike brand.  These two competitors are important in that they are the two largest athletic apparel manufacturers / retailers in the world; although they are much less focused on creating a community (and therefore differ somewhat in focus and strategy from LULU; this is also why a NKE acquisition of LULU is so unlikely).  UnderArmour is more sports / performance-focused than LULU (they made a major hire in 2008 to ramp up their women's apparel, but I don't have too much hard backup here).  I'd view UA's role in the yoga market as similar to NKE, in that they are more focused on products and wholesaling.
Athleta - Gap purchased Athleta for ~$150mm in 2008; a catalogue / online business selling third party and private label products (private label are the vast majority of sales) to athletic women.  Athleta's products are priced at meaningful discounts, although they get good reviews and seem to be high quality.  Athleta products are sold across all Gap websites (Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic), allowing Gap to leverage its existing online distribution with a new product set.  It is unclear if Athleta will build out a meaningful retail presence.
Smaller Players - Victoria's Secret, Eddie Bauer, Bebe Sport, J Crew, PrAna, Lotuswear are all vying for a piece of the yoga market.  Eddie Bauer's yoga brand has ambitions to grow to 200 stores, as does Bebe Sport.  Private label is not considered here.
The table below details key operating metrics for several of LULU's purest comps.  I believe that Victoria's Secret is the best long-term comp, given the brand and focus.  There are no perfect comparisons, but the table below, coupled with competitor pricing data suggest that LULU's operating metrics and margins are unsustainable.

  US Store Base is Less Productive - LULU's growth has been and will be driven by US expansion.  LULU's domestic stores are about 50% as productive as their legacy Canadian stores (LULU is based in Vancouver).  Some drop-off is to be expected given a normal productivity curve for new retail locations; however, there are several notable differences between the Canadian stores and the newly launched / future US stores.  
LULU was really the ""first one there"" with a high-end yoga offering in the early part of the decade.  Store growth has been impacted by the recession (5 openings this CY, 40 planned in 2010), impacting LULU's brand awareness and ultimate reach.  The longer it takes to roll out new stores, the less attractive these new markets are due to the presence of incremental competition.
Their Canadian stores were launched during a different economic era, when consumers were less cost conscious.  In addition to this macro shift in consumer behavior, the US market is increasingly competitive, with competitors' products priced at meaningful discounts.  Competitors may not have to (or may not want to) recreate LULU's ""communities"", and can effectively backfill yoga products into their portfolio and leverage their existing distribution.
The table below details comp store productivity for the Canadian and US stores.  Sustained gaps in productivity suggest that the US market opportunity is not as big as some might think.  If management makes it to 300 stores, is it reasonable to think that they will be generating ~$1,450 in sales per square foot?

  Valuation - At $31 LULU trades at 26x FYE 2012 EPS. This is a very rich valuation for a young retailer in an increasingly competitive yoga market. The assumptions below use management's long-term stated goals, or apply status quo metrics going forward. Under these ""blue sky"" assumptions the stock is fairly valued using a 10% discount rate. The stock is priced for perfection and I see downside to ~$20, or 20.0x my 2012 EPS of $1.00 (or about a 1.00x PEG).

  Risks
Short Squeeze - 7mm shares are sold short as of 12/31/09, or ~17% of the float.  The shares have been extremely volatile since coming public in July 2007, and will likely continue to exhibit sustained volatility (valuation, float, etc.).  LULU is up 600%+ from a 52 week low.
M&A - LULU has been periodically mentioned as an acquisition target, for an acquirer who would look to gain entry into the growing yoga market.  Reports claim that Nike and Addidas were interested in buying LULU at the time of the 2005 financing.  Someone could theoretically buy LULU, but given the (i) size ($2bn + control premium), (ii) valuation, and (iii) store base I don't see this happening, or at least not anywhere near these levels.
I do not doubt that Nike / Addidas were interested in 2005, but these claims do not make sense today.  At the time LULU had a ~$200mm enterprise value, today it is $2bn.  The Company has grown and outperformed expectations but the brand and strategy are effectively established.  Further, a sale to a ""big corporate"" buyer would be completely inconsistent with LULU's goals & ideals, and could dilute the brand value.
LULU is a standalone brand, with 119 stores and plans for many more.  Comparisons with Gap's acquisition of Athleta (done at ~3 /4x current year sales) are misleading.  Any buyer would assume LULU's store base and leases, making this a less attractive acquisition (someone can't strip out the SG&A; they simply need to think they can run the business better than the current management).
Summary
LULU needs to grow their store base another 150% to reach their long-term target; so assuming 40 new stores per year and no showroom closings (typically closed after 18 months), they will be fully penetrated by mid 2014.  Sales per square foot will be diluted down as they expand into new, smaller markets, and gross margins will compress given fierce competition.  The shares are priced for perfection and I'd think about covering in the $20 range.
Catalysts
Increased competition / margin compression
Re-pricing of the equity
Insider Sales - As briefly noted, Advent owns 7% of the stock through a 2005 PE financing.  My rough estimates suggest they have already realized a ~5.3x COC return.  Advent's actions here will be very interesting.
This investment has been a huge success, given the sector and vintage year.  In fact, it has already been such a success that Advent may be taking a ""house money"" view towards this last 7%.
Alternatively, Advent (who has several representatives on LULU's board) could just take the incremental ~1.5x COC and juice their IRR (all else equal).  With the shares near a 52 week high and approaching the five year mark, my guess would be that they sell.
As a more general note, insider buying has been non-existent since the IPO and insiders (aside from founder Chip Wilson) own a minimal amount of stock.

  BGCP has been written up three times before on VIC, by danconia17 on 11/17/2009, rii136 on 02/04/2013 and compass868 on 11/23/2015. The current trade recommendation will focus on the upcoming spinoff. Please refer to the three other excellent VIC write-ups for historical context. 

Trade Recommendation 

BGCP is spinning out its residual shares in Newmark and de-consolidating it from its balance sheet. The resulting corporate event will materialize in a new BGCP. The new BGCP has:

• 15% revenue in electronic brokerage referred to as Fenics, a high margin (~40% pre-tax adj. earnings margin) that has grown revenue at a 24% CAGR from 2010-Q1’18 LTM. 

• A remaining business in traditional hybrid/voice brokerage, which recently grew by acquisition to have 35-38% of overall market share. The hybrid/voice brokerage has a focus in esoteric products that are less impacted by growth in electronic trading. While this sub-segment is partly impacted by the movement to electronic, any flow from hybrid/voice to Fenics is highly margin accretive.  

• An under-levered balance sheet with a net cash position and a proven management team with a history of value creation.

• Currently trading at 7.57x management’s $398MM Q1’18 LTM EBITDA, pro-forma for the new balance sheet and NMRK shares to be received upon spin. Adjusting management’s Q1’18 LTM EBITDA headline number to $359MM for onetime items results in slightly lower valuation, though still attractive at 8.38x. 

Trade:

• Buy BGCP equity.

• Short 0.47851 shares (current spin ratio) of Newmark per share of BGCP to hedge the incoming spinoff distribution and create BGCP standalone/RemainCo. 

• Short equal amounts of the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) shares per BGCP standalone value (i.e. BGCP pres-spin value less expected NMRK distribution value), as a sector hedge. 

Once BGCP spins out Newmark, valuation will re-rate. BGCP’s SOTP value gives a current target price of $15.71, a 39.9% upside from the current stock price and a downside of 15.1% for a 2.64:1 upside/downside ratio. Upside and downside are outlined in the SOTP and differs on multiples used and spin conversion ratio.

Situation

On December 13, 2017 BGCP conducted a partial IPO of Newmark Group, Inc. (NMRK) by offering 20MM shares at $14/share and 3MM via greenshoe. The original expectations were for a 30MM share issuance at $19-$22/share and 4.5MM of greenshoe. Proceeds of $298.3MM, net, were used to pay debt. 

Currently BGCP owns 59% of Newmark common stock, with over 90% total voting power and fully consolidates NMRK’s operations. By year end, BGCP intends to spin the remaining shares in NMRK and separate the two companies’ balance sheets, repaying debt Newmark owes to BGCP but is consolidated on BGCP’s balance sheet as a liability, leaving BGCP unlevered post transaction. 

Company Overview

BGCP today is a combination of an interdealer broker and a commercial real estate (CRE) brokerage. The company's mix is currently 45% real estate services (CRE, the SpinCo) and 54% financial services (the RemainCo) as shown below. 


Source: BGCP Q1’18 Investor Presentation

The interdealer broker (BGCP’s business post-NMRK spin), or financial services, operates as an agent between various counterparties trading illiquid derivative products in the OTC market (interest rate swaps, credit, FX). Within this segment BGCP’s crown jewel is its electronic trading Fenics business. This business consists of ~15% of the segment’s revenue and has ~40% pre-tax adj earnings margins. Products traded include interest rate derivatives, credit, FX, bonds; the segment also includes software, market data and post-trade services. Comparable companies are the NEX Group.  The other part of the business is the traditional voice/hybrid business at mid-to-high-teen earnings pre-tax earnings margin with 2,468 brokers and salespeople. Comparable companies include TP ICAP PLC and CFT SW. 

The CRE segment (Newmark), or real estate services, provides leasing and sales and property management services for large corporate customers, similar to a Jones Lang Lasalle (JLL) and a CBRE Group (CBG).

Corporate Transaction

Spin Shares (Table to Follow)

• BGCP currently owns 150.3MM shares in Newmark to be spun to BGCP holders at the event, comprising 59% of all Newmark shares. Post distribution, the float in Newmark will increase from 9.1% to 68.2%. The spin ratio is 0.47851 Newmark shares per BGCP participant. 

• While management is targeting a 0.47851 spin ratio, there is risk this number declines to a 0.31183 spin ratio if all of BGCP’s units convert to class A and B shares, thus accruing less value to current BGCP class A and B holders.

• The distribution and spin ratio are all calculated and shown below:



Balance Sheet (Table to Follow)

Importantly, both companies share a balance sheet and post spin this will end, as well as the intercompany loans in-between them with Newmark paying debt owed to BGCP and refinancing shared debt where Newmark is the obligor. 

Key balance sheet points of the transaction:

• Newmark – At 3/31/18, NMRK had long term debt of $813MM and short term debt of $202MM for a total of $1,015MM in debt. 

o Newmark debt is broken down as follows:
$202MM in short term intercompany borrowings – borrowed from BGCP and payable to BGCP.
$400MM converted term loan; NMRK is the obligator and plans to refinance this loan.
$300MM 2019 promissory notes payable to BGCP. 
$113MM 2042 promissory notes payable to BGCP.

o In addition, assets include: 
Cash of $48MM. 
The company also has restricted cash of $243.9M; however the bulk of this is required for their credit profile and regulatory reasons. 

• BGCP – At 3/31/18, BGCP had total debt of $1,382MM, this included:

o Newmark consolidated debt:
$398MM of unsecured term loan (the converted $400MM term loan, an obligation of NMRK).
$298MM 5.375% senior note ($300MM 2019 promissory notes payable to BGCP).
$109MM 8.125% senior note ($113MM 2042 promissory notes payable to BGCP).

o BGCP standalone debt:
$6MM in short-term borrowings (Itau Unibanco S.A.).
$241MM in 8.375% Senior Notes (""GFI"" Notes).
$297MM in 5.125% Senior Notes (Make-Whole, CoC at 101).
$32MM in collateralized borrowings.

o Intercompany receivables:
A total of $430MM of intercompany obligations. This includes:
• $298MM 2019 Promissory Notes - Payable to BGCP.
• $109MM 2042 Promissory Notes - Payable to BGCP.
• Two short term intercompany loans netted are $22MM, consisting of:
o $202MM Short-term borrowings to NMRK from BGCP.
o $180MM Short-term borrowings to Cantor from BGCP.

o In addition, assets include:
Cash of $363MM (this includes $48MM of consolidated Newmark cash).
Other liquid assets of $92MM:
• ($89MM in securities owned plus $3MM in marketable securities ($96MM marketable securities less $93MM securities loaned) less $1M in repurchase agreements. 

Separate capital structures are given in the pro-forma capital structure section. 
  The below worksheet summaries this section: 


Nasdaq shares (“NDAQ”)

On June 28, 2013, BGC sold eSpeed to Nasdaq, Inc. for $750MM in cash plus an expected payment of up to 14.9MM shares of Nasdaq common stock paid ratably over 15 years beginning in 2013, assuming Nasdaq generates at least $25MM in gross revenues each of these years (vastly below the current level). 

In connection with Newmark’s IPO in December 2017, BGC transferred to Newmark the right to receive the remainder of the Nasdaq payments. Newmark recognized the first of payment in Q3’17, and planned to receive shares ratably in Q3 of each of the next ten fiscal years (0.992MM shares a year). 

On June 18, 2018 Newmark entered into a transaction that essentially saw NMRK: 

• Receive net proceeds of $153MM, with proceeds being used to pay down the converted term loan.

• Monetize 2019/2020 Nasdaq shares and issue $175MM of exchange preferred limited partnership units.


Newmark, post the recent sale, retains several years of NDAQ share distribution. The below calculates the total value to Newmark based on the recent NDAQ stock price. The total undiscounted and untaxed value is $747.8MM, or $654.4MM not including the upcoming Q3’18 payment. This corresponds to the 6/20/18 BGCP annual shareholders meeting conference call, which stated this value to be approximately $650MM. 

Using NDAQ’s WACC as the discount rate and Newmark’s tax rate, results in a post-tax NPV value of $431MM, as highlighted below. 


Pro-Forma Capital Structures

The below summarizes the new capital structure of Newmark and BGCP with summary financials. 

Newmark new capital structure and summary



As Newmark will be hedged out via a short of Newmark’s current stock in the same ratio as the spin-off ratio, a simple projection model based on consensus expectations was used. 

BGCP new capital structure and summary 



Key financial notes:

• Until Q3’17, BGCP accounted for the NDAQ impact within their financial services section, the SpinCo. The above numbers have been adjusted to remove this impact.  For example, BGCP’s headline management EBITDA number of $398MM Q1’18 LTM EBITDA includes the NDAQ impact; removing this results in a value of $359MM. 

• Key financial drivers were in line with recent results:
Electronic Brokerage:  10% revenue growth.
Data, software and post-trade:  3% revenue growth.
Data, software and post-trade (inter-company): 5% revenue growth. 
o Fenics (Fully Electronic) Revenues (SpinCo): a total of 6% revenue growth. 
  o Voice/Hybrid Other  (SpinCo): a total of 2% revenue growth. 

o Pre-tax adjusted earnings 
Fenics: flat margins assumed, as with 2017/2016.
Voice/Hybrid: 2% improvement in margins.

Company Review

Consolidated Segments



The consolidated company gave results by Financial Services (the RemainCo) and Real Estate. Distributions from Nasdaq holdings until Q3’17 were included in financial services, removing them from pre-tax adjusted earnings lower but also smoothes margins as shown above.   

BGCP Stand Alone

BGCP post spin will be a simple commission based agency trading model. The segment acts as an agent/intermediary between other banks and focuses on esoteric credit based products traded via the OTC. The company’s primary products are credit, rates, FX, equities, energy and commodities. BGCP provides anonymity, price discovery and liquidity to trading partners and takes no principal balance sheet risk. 

Today, BGCP has 35-38% market share of brokering only revenue, which is a subset of the $10bn+ interdealer broker market, which itself is a small piece of the larger bank FICC market of $165bn and exchange/execution/data market of $47bn. BGCP has over 2,500 brokers and salespeople and over 200 financial desks in 30 cities. 

• Fenics - electronic trading side of BGCP partners
o There is a secular shift from a traditional voice/hybrid business to a fully electronic trading platform, such as FENICS. BGCP has wisely invested in this shift and benefits from the flow from its voice/hybrid model to its FENICS product at 3x higher margins. 
o Examples of BGCP investing in this sub-segment include the GFI acquisition in 2015 for $750MM with $90MM in cost synergies, which included Trayport (an electronic information services and energy trading platform in the UK) that was sold in 2015 for $650MM, creating the core business for 1x synergies. 

• Voice/hybrid trading
o Voice/hybrid trading has a higher share of revenue but lower margin and growth than FENICS. 
o The company’s illiquid and esoteric nature of products traded suggests a large proportion of BGCP’s volumes are not likely to be traded on an exchange or completely electronically. 
o Industry consolidation has occurred in this space with two of BGCP’s largest competitors engaging in a transaction.
o On 11/11/2015, TLFP acquired ICAP’s voice brokerage business for 10x pre-tax earnings, leaving TLPR LN a pure play voice/hybrid competitor and ICAP an electronic and information services provider.

Newmark Standalone 

On the commercial real estate brokerage side, BGCP entered this business with the acquisition of Newmark Knight Frank in 2011. Since 2011, Newmark has purchased over 35 companies, including its 2012 purchase of CRE brokerage “Grubb and Ellis” out of bankruptcy for a token price, as well as Silicon Valley based Cornish & Carey in CRE services, Apartment Realty Advisors or (ARA) in multifamily investment sales, and Berkeley Point in GSE lending and servicing. Over the past 6 years, BGCP took Newmark from zero to over $1bn in revenue. Newmark is headquartered in New York City with over 120 offices in 90 cities, 4,600 employees, and over 1,500 revenue-generating producers.

Main segments:
• Leasing (39% of revenue)
o Key drivers: volume of leases signed and market rental rates
o Revenues are split with the leasing agent, with the leasing agent receiving 50-60% of the total revenue in commission.

• Sales / capital markets (25% of revenue)
o Investment sales, equity financing, loan sale advisory 
o Key drivers: CRE transaction volume and pricing, impacted by financing availability. 
o This sub-segment has been pressured lately by the reduction in office transactions. 

• Management Services (24% of revenue)
o Commercial services for tenants and landlords. Services include property and facilities management, servicing of loans originated by NRMK and third parties. 

• Mortgage Banking (13% of revenue)
o This is entirely driven by the Berkeley Point transaction that Newmark bought in September 2017. 
o Consists of origination of loans with borrowers and sales of loans to investors. 

Within the CRE industry, Newmark has a vastly higher degree of stock compensation compared to peers, a large segment of the company’s adjusted EBITDA. This is due to the company’s structure as a partnership model, where producers sign multiyear employee agreements and accept equity as a large portion of their compensation. The valuation impact is notable and quantified below. CRE brokers are a historic high beta sector as shown below:

Valuation 

Newmark

Newmark trades in-line with peers, including all management add-backs and excluding NDAQ value. Newmark is cheaper than peers when NDAQ value is included, and management add-backs are included. 

For Newmark, stock comp (and other adjustments) makes up a large portion of adjusted EBITDA and has a large valuation impact as shown below.There is great sensitivity with stock comp as a higher stock price results in less shares issued and therefore a lower the dilution / higher EPS impact. Of course this works in the opposite direction as well. 
  Newmark is being removed from the BGCP trade via a short of the SpinCo distribution shares.

  Newmark 2019E EV/EBITDA without management adjustments 



  BGCP

The below shows the EV/EBITDA of BGCP standalone, with the full value of the spin shares at current market price. Adding the full value to BGCP’s standalone EV however understates their impact as its spread out among BGCP’s entire market cap (i.e. this NMRK spin valued is added to BGCP’s standalone EV, which includes 482MM shares), however only 314.1MM of BGCP’s shares (Class A and B) are due to receive the NMRK shares. 


Upside 1 – Management’s Expected Spin Ratio of 0.47851 

A sum of the parts on BGCP results in a 39.9% upside as shown below. This includes the NMRK value that class A and B shareholders are due to receive based on the current spin ratio and multiples below peers/precedent transactions. 




Upside 2– Full Conversion of Units - Expected Spin Ratio of 0.31183

However, if all of BGCP’s 482MM diluted shares and units decide to receive NMRK’s stock, the difference would be approximately a $2.38/sh impact and thus a lower spin ratio.  The new spin ratio would be 0.31183, or 482MM / 150.3MM = 0.31183



Downside 

Downside 1– Management’s Expected Spin Ratio of 0.47851 

A downside package target for BGCP with reduced multiples: 7.5x multiple for Fenics and a 4.0x multiple for voice/hybrid. The Fenics multiple is half of Nex Group’s multiple and the voice/hybrid is below the valuation for TP ICAP, even with TP ICAP’s recent 35% downward move. 



Downside 2– Full Conversion of Units - Expected Spin Ratio of 0.31183

Using the same multiples as the downside case 1, with the lower spin ratio results in the following:

TP ICAP PLC

TP ICAP was the combination of Tullet Prebon and ICAP’s hybrid/voice brokerage (12/30/2016), with ICAP’s electronic brokerage becoming Nex Group. TP ICAP is a near pure play hybrid/voice brokerage broker. On July 10, 2018, TP ICAP PLC issued a profit warning and their CEO resigned, causing the stock to sell off by 35%.Weakness was due to higher costs from Brexit and MiFID II, IT costs (the company is moving to a large IT platform) and higher broker compensation (at least 51% of revenue up from 50.5% in 2017, despite expectations for a level in the high 40s).

Summary
Avenue Therapeutics (“ATXI”) offers 100%+ upside within the next 24 months if its intravenous (“IV”) drug tramadol gets approved and its deal with Cipra is consummated as agreed. We think at prices below <$6.00, ATXI shares have a very attractive risk-reward profile because one is primarily taking FDA / DEA approval risk: (i) tramadol is a proven and approved chemical compound that’s been on the market in its oral form for more than 20 years in the US, (ii) results from the clinical trials are out and they look fine, and (iii) the deal signed with Cipra means that ATXI shareholders will get a pretty well defined pay-out with Cipra taking on all commercialization risk. Based on the Cipra deal, ATXI shareholders will receive $13-14.00 per share plus a Contingent Value Right (“CVR”), and this is only subject to IV tramadol getting FDA approval and DEA Schedule IV classification. Given ATXI has nothing other than IV tramadol, the downside is $0.00.
We’ll go through the drug, its history and clinical results, and last but not least the Cipla deal, which frames the potential outcomes for ATXI shareholders depending on what the US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) end up deciding. The ongoing opioid crisis may act as a deterrent to some as IV tramadol is a weak opioid, however, we believe that opioids do have a role to play in public health despite their abuse risks.
Drug Description
Tramadol in its oral form was first launched in the 70s in Europe and was sold by Johnson & Johnson under the Ultram brand name in the US since the 90s. IV tramadol has been on the market in Europe since 1992 and accounts for ~10% of all IV analgesic use in the post-operative setting in the EU. IMS estimates the number of patients experiencing medium to severe pain in the 7-8 million range in a hospital setting, so the market is quite large. ATXI estimates the relevant market size to be $1bn.
Tramadol is considered a weak opioid agonist with reduced efficacy compared to morphine but also weaker side effects, with reduced risk of addiction. As such, DEA officially reclassified oral tramadol as a Schedule IV substance in 2014, citing tramadol’s superior safety profile as it was pretty widely prescribed by doctors anyways. Its Schedule IV classification has also allowed oral tramadol to escape the declining production quotas for Schedule II opioids, which should, in fact, be a tailwind for alternatives like IV tramadol once it gets approved.
Because tramadol as a chemical compound has already been approved by the FDA, IV tramadol follows the 505b(2) approval path, which are generally more likely to receive final approval compared to New Molecular Entities (“NMEs”) that have to go down the 505b(1) path. In terms of high level probabilities, non-NMEs have a ~90% chance of receiving FDA approval after filing an NDA, although bear in mind that only ~2/3 of all drugs received FDA approval first time around compared to ~85% overall based on industry data.
Clinical Results
ATXI has already completed all its Phase 3 studies and the results were very positive, meeting the primary endpoints as well as all key secondary endpoints. It’s noteworthy that ATXI ran a morphine arm in the abdominoplasty study and showed that IV tramadol’s efficacy as measured by SPID24 was only slightly worse than morphine whilst also having a slightly better adverse event profile than morphine. These results are not surprising given tramadol as a chemical compound has been on the market for so long and is pretty well understood by the medical community. This data is clearly important to get FDA approval and supports the overall thesis that IV tramadol should get approval in our view.
Given numerous companies with analgesics received Complete Response Letters (“CRLs”) from the FDA over the past year or so, we’ve spent a lot of time analysing ATXI’s and competitors’ studies and have found no obvious flaws that may lead to a CRL for IV tramadol. ATXI is using the same primary endpoints as Recro Pharma was using for IV Meloxicam, and has already completed a QT/QTc study which Trevena is working on for Oliceridine.  Heron got a CRL for manufacturing issues and some non-clinical data and has resubmitted already. ATXI’s manufacturing partner is Polpharma, a reputable Polish contract manufacturer, but so far, ATXI hasn’t qualified a back-up manufacturing partner.
Company History
Fortress Biotech first in-licensed the US rights to IV tramadol from Revogenex in 2015, and IPO’d ATXI with its rights to IV tramadol in 2017 at $6.00. IPO proceeds were used to fund the clinical studies and was budgeted to be sufficient to complete all clinical trials. ATXI was running a bit short of funding to complete the second study so in May 2018, ATXI decided to look for a partner upon completion of the bunionectomy study. There were three expressions of interest, which culminated in the deal with Cipla that closed early 2019, which we’ll describe next.
Cipla Deal
Summary
Cipla is an India-based family owned pharmaceutical business that wants to break into the hospital business in the US with an enterprise value of $5bn and revenues of $2.3bn. In a nutshell, Cipla agreed to taking a 33% stake in ATXI via a capital increase at $6.00 (~$35mn in total) and the obligation to buy out non-Cipla ATXI shareholders for ~$13-14.00 if IV tramadol receives FDA approval and Schedule IV classification by DEA plus a CVR. Given where ATXI shares trade now, this represents upside in excess of 100%+ within 2 years.
Condition Precedents to Closing
There are several conditions that need to be cleared before ATXI shareholders can get the final pay-out from Cipla. Key ones are below:
1.       Obtaining FDA approval by April 30, 2021,
2.       Labelling to contain an indication as moderate to moderately severe (post-operative) pain, not restricted to any specific type of surgery and no requirement to use this in conjunction with other NSAIDs, and
3.       Classification by DEA as a Schedule IV drug.
Obtaining full FDA approval may be tight by the April 2021 deadline if ATXI gets a CRL, plus approval delays in excess of 15 months may entitle Revogenex to terminate the IV tramadol license. We don’t think 2. is likely going to be a problem given the way the studies have been set up and the efficacy data. 3. could be problematic, but oral tramadol has Schedule IV classification today, which sets an encouraging precedent. The fact that IV tramadol can be marketed as a (slightly) weaker alternative to morphine, which is a Schedule II opioid, should at the margin help IV tramadol’s case for approval.
Proceeds
ATXI has guided to proceeds of $13.92 per share, however, we prefer to err on the conservative side despite management reassurances that they’ve been on budget so far, because the exact determination of final proceeds is a bit more complicated.
To be precise, Cipla has agreed to pay (a) $180mn to all non-Cipla shareholders of ATXI, less (b) various fees payable to ATXI’s licensing and manufacturing partners, as well as (c) certain advances, indemnifications, and (d) transaction fees. Based on ATXI’s best estimates, ATXI shareholders will get $13.92 per share of proceeds, corresponding to $163mn in net proceeds to non-Cipla ATXI shareholders after various costs have been taken into account.
CVR
We won’t dwell on this too much because the revenue hurdles are quite high and we don’t want to worry too much about the ultimate home-run scenarios. In short, the CVR will be paying approximately the following amounts after deductions of COGS, royalties, and miscellaneous expenses:
1.       Until 2028: ~$1.80+ per share if annual net revenues exceed $325mn
2.       From 2029 until the earlier of (i) 2036, (ii) patent expiry, (iii) FDA approval of another IV tramadol, once this product has cleared $1.5bn in cumulative net revenues: ~$1.15+ per share if annual net revenues exceed $100mn
Risks
Non-approval because this is an opioid
We are all well aware of the opioid crisis: many lives are lost as people are unnecessarily put on opioids and get addicted, doctors are being discouraged from prescribing opioids, and multi-billion settlements are being reached by participants along the supply chain. However, the analgesic effects of opioids are unrivalled and don’t carry problematic side effects like elevated bleeding risks that NSAIDs come with. Whilst many analgesics have been failing to get approval, we want to point out that anecdotally speaking, AcelRx’s Sufentanil received approval last year notwithstanding the ongoing opioid crisis.
Non-approval because clinical efficacy data isn’t good enough
This feels rather unlikely given the clinical data.
Non-approval because data is missing
We think that ATXI has covered all bases, but unexpected things can and do trip up approval processes.
Delayed approval
This could be problematic given the somewhat tight timeline specified by Cipla, however, as long as FDA doesn’t hand out a “not approvable” verdict, we think Cipla and Revogenex will be reasonable.
Patent protection
Whilst IV tramadol doesn’t enjoy composition-of-matter protection anymore, ATXI holds 4 patents that expire between 2032 and 2036 covering how IV tramadol is administered, for what it’s worth.
Commercial sales
We don’t attribute any value to the CVR, so FDA approval and Schedule IV classification will be the key risks to our thesis. Whilst we do think that IV tramadol see good take-up being the only IV opioid on the market should, there’s certainly a fair bit of non-opioid competition in the pipeline and the market isn’t that huge.
Cipra default
Technically speaking, this deal has been done with a Cipra subsidiary called Invagen. In the scheme of things, we think financing risk here is low.
No alternatives
ATXI only has IV tramadol, so this is a very targeted shot on goal.

Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: EXPE)
Buy Recommendation
  Summary:
  Buy recommendation EXPE at $119 with 35% upside to $160 in 1 year, and continued teens value compounding over time.  The stock is trading at an attractive valuation: 9.3x 1 year forward EV/EBITDA vs. ~10.5x 5-year average, and 8.2x 2020 EBITDA, and 17x 2019 P/E and 15x 2020 P/E,  which I think is cheap for a company growing revenues at 10% CAGR, EBITDA at 10-15%, and P/E at a high teens rate. EV/EBITDA is the main valuation metrics for EXPE.   It’s is cheap on an absolute, relative, and historical basis; especially for a company that has secular tailwinds (travel and the shift to online), with much runway for growth.  The discount is due to near term execution challenges that are transitory and overly negative sentiment around competitive threat from Aribnb and Google’s push into the OTA segment.  I believe those worries are overblown. EXPE is well positioned to benefit from continued share gain from offline travel agencies and international growth, and operates in an oligopily.  EXPE owns HomeAway and also benefits from the growth of alternative accommodations.
  Also, Expedia (and Booking) have reset rev growth expectations lower over the last 1.5 years and gotten past a marketing investment phase and will get past a costly cloud transition investment phase in 2 years.  Hence margins are expanding and should continue to expand for years (which is important and generally drives Internet stocks and multiples higher). The stock has also recently been pressured by European macro concerns (which I think will abate as China stimulus takes root and the trade war is resolved [Europe’s economy is more sensitive to China]).  And recent Boing 737 max has also caused a brief hiccup in travel, but will sort itself out as airlines swap in other planes. 
  Industry Backdrop
  Online travel industry is an attractive market with strong underlying momentum and favorable near and long-term growth prospects. Phocuswright (a travel industry focused research firm) estimates total global travel bookings was ~$1.4T in 2018, up 9% from 2017. The industry group believes online bookings growth outpaced the overall market, grew by 14% and accounted for 45% of total travel.  
    Globally, air accounts for 41% of total travel spend with hotels at 34%. However, hotels are far more lucrative for OTAs with commissions ranging from 10-20% of total room value vs. a single digit % or flat fee for air bookings. The two industries operate on different fee structures because:
On the supply side, the hotel industry is far less consolidated compared to airlines, which means the large OTAs have greater leverage to negotiate commissions. Additionally, hotels rely more on intermediaries for distribution
On the demand side, travelers utilize online channels to assess room type/quality, offered amenities, and price differential between rooms. For air bookings, travellers look for the lowest ticket price and look to utilize accumulated miles to offset as much cost as possible
On both sides, OTAs offer a far more compelling value proposition for booking hotels through their sites compared to plane tickets. This leads to the substantially different commission structures between the two industries.
  While a lot of the U.S. travel industry growth has been driven by baby boomers in recent decades, millennials will serve as a growth driver going forward. There is a clear preference among millennials for experiences versus material possessions, and travel fits that bill. This is also the first generation to grow up entirely in the internet age; as a result, there is a high degree of comfort for booking trips online. Millennials expect to have real-time information, personalized trips, and authentic/peer reviews accessible across multiple devices. This creates a huge opportunity for online travel agencies.
  Outside the developed markets, China represents an enormous opportunity from (1) outbound Chinese travel, where Western companies are fairly well positioned; (2) inbound Chinese travel, where Booking Group has a leg up given its relationship with state-run travel provider Ctrip.com, and (3) domestic Chinese travel, which is largely untapped by Western companies. 
    However, there are a few competitive risks for the large and established OTA vendors. As a result, they are de-rated fairly significantly from their peak valuations from a few years ago. Key concerns include:
Alternative Accommodations:
The proliferation of alternative accommodations (individually owned homes and apartments, B&B’s, vacation properties, etc.) driven by consumer’s preference for uniqueness and better pricing.  This is both an opportunity and a threat to OTAs. 
Glass half full: alternative supply is a largely untapped resource of potentially bookable properties to online travel providers, which could offer significant incremental commissions (e.g. through Expedia’s HomeAway)
Glass half empty: alternative accommodations could put potential downward pressure on overall room prices. This is also a market that is dominated by Airbnb, a relative upstart that is looking to encroach on more traditional room supply. Airbnb is undercutting OTAs by providing many of the same services to independent hotels at lower commissions, but usually charges travellers a booking fee
I’m in the glass half full camp:   As we’ve seen, alternative accommodations have been a growth driver for both Expedia and Booking.com with huge TAM.  The rising tide is lifting all boats as BKNG, EXPE, and AirBNB are all growing rapidly in the alternative accommodations space.  HomeAway has been growing EBITDA rapidly (and become a meaningful contributor to growth) while the core OTA business has also kept growing at a healthy rate
Hotel and AirBnB rentals have been able to co-exist and fit different use cases, rather than directly cannibalize.  
Indeed, the alt accommodations space has been driving the growth for BKNG and EXPE recently and provides a long runway of growth
Expedia has accelerated organic inventory growth in 2018 and beyond, and has made impressive progress in urban areas and parts of Europe
EXPE is also working on cross-listing properties between its core OTA and HomeAway to improve bookings on both
Google:
Over 60% of leisure travellers and 70% of business travellers begin their search process on Google. As a result, Google is the primary distribution point for online travel companies and the beneficiary of a disproportionate share of marketing dollars
Google has been slowly improving its travel services and offerings, in many instances favoring Google’s own products over organic search results. As a result, this hurts the efficacy of OTA’s organic search results, lowers OTA’s conversion rates, and drives up OTA’s price of Google ads
Google does not have the capabilities to function as an OTA (end-to-end multi-country, multi-language customer support, on the ground salesforce to sign up hotels…etc.), and it would require substantial amount of investment to do so
OTAs still provide a substantial amount of advertising revenue to Google (EXPE ~$3.5bn, BKNG ~$4.3bn – around 6% in total), so it’s not in Google’s best interest to negatively disrupt OTAs dramatically.  But is is in their interest to make just enough changes to make OTAs pay more for ads. 
Expedia generates 2/3rds of its Bookings from direct branded channels.  So their reliance on any other intermediary isn’t that large (around 25%) 
Expedia (like Bookings.com are also using other advertising channels
Hotels Going Direct:
Large hotels suppliers like Marriot and Hilton, have attempted to disintermediate OTAs and capture a larger portion of direct bookings. These suppliers are not only looking to minimize distribution costs but also developing direct consumer relationship to upsell on rooms/amenities, increase customer loyalty, and bolster their brand
This has been the trend in the US, where hotel chains are much more consolidated. However, the vast majority of hotels around the work are mostly operated as boutiques (hence have little bargaining power or ability to go direct), so they offer much better opportunities for OTAs. 
i.e. the hotel industry overall is very fragmented,  so the few aggregators (EXPE, and BKGN) still have the bargaining power and take rates likely will stay high in what is effectively an oligopoly 
  Company Description
  Expedia Group is the second largest OTA in terms of annual revenue, it has 1.8mm vacation rental listings (370k HomeAway listings), 312mm annual room nights, over 500 airlines, in 200 countries and territories. The company’s reporting segments consist of Core OTA, Homeaway, trivago, and Egencia.
  VRBO stands for Vacation Rental By Owner
    Core OTA: EXPE’s largest reporting segment which accounts for ~82% of Gross Bookings, ~78% of revenue, and ~87% of EBITDA
The segment targets non-managed leisure travellers across every global region with websites catering to a wide array of travel needs and price points. Core OTA revenues are split between merchant and the agency models, with skew heavily favoring merchant but agency revenues growing at a faster rate. The vast majority of revenues are derived from hotels, although relative to BKNG, EXPE has a sizable air ticket business.
Merchant Model: In this model, hotels sell rooms to OTAs in bulk at discounted or wholesale prices. The OTAs then sell them to customers at a marked-up price. This is the most commonly used model, and it benefits both parties.
Agency Model: This is a commission-based model wherein hotels give OTAs commissions based on business bought. In this model, the hotels list their services, and the OTAs don’t have to buy anything up front. This is beneficial for hotels, as it gives them the freedom to price their rooms according to demand scenario.
Core OTA consists of the following websites and programs:
Expedia.com: Full-service OTA where users can book hotel, airline, cruise, and rental cars via localized sites in 33 countries with over 95mm unique monthly visitors
Hotels.com: Non-opaque hotel booking service along with bundled hotel and airfare deals. Users can book hotels in 242 countries and territories. By itself, Hotels.com is one of the largest OTAs with over 50mm unique monthly visitors across over 90 localized websites and +$20bn in gross bookings  
opaque inventory is the market of selling unsold travel inventory at a discounted price. The inventory is called ""opaque"" because the specific suppliers (i.e. hotel, airline, etc.) remain hidden until after the purchase has been completed. This is done to prevent sales of unsold inventory from cannibalizing full-price retail sales.
The primary consumers of opaque inventories are price-conscious people whose primary aim is the cheapest travel possible and are less concerned with the specifics of their travel plans. Hotel discounts of 30-60% are typical, and bargains are stronger at a higher star hotel. While one has control over the dates and times of a travel itinerary, the downside is these purchases are absolutely non-refundable and non-changeable and, as noted above, the specific hotel or airline is not revealed until after purchase.
Orbitz: Orbitz was acquired by Expedia in September 2015 along with Orbitz for Business, Cheaptickets, eBookers, HotelClub, and RatestoGo. Orbitz is a multi-product OTA which had its own sizable inventory but now leverages Expedia supply and technology. Orbitz essentially competes with Expedia.com for customers with the only differentiating factor being the rewards offering, which pre-dates the acquisition and has over 7mm members using “Orbucks.”
Expedia Affiliate Network (EAN): Expedia’s primary B2B partnership which gives corporate partners and travel agents access to hotels.com supply, rates, and company technology
Hotwire: Expedia’s opaque booking service for more price conscious travellers willing to sacrifice detailed product knowledge for a below retail rate. Hotwire provides supplier with flexibility to dump excess inventory without diluting brand and effecting retail pricing structure. The site sells hotel rooms, airline tickets, and car rentals under merchant model. Hotwire competes directly with Priceline’s “Express Deals” and “Name Your Own Price” services
Wotif Group: Wotif primarily acts as an OTA in Australia and Asia providing access to 29K hotels and airline tickets. Acquired by Expedia in July 2014 for $657mm. Competes with Agoda.com and Ctrip
Travelocity: Full-service OTA acquired by Expedia in January 2015 from Sabre for $280mm
CarRentals.com: Part of Expedia since acquisition in March 2008. Pure car rental site with inventory from all of the largest U.S. and European carriers. Gained European presence after Expedia acquired Auto Escape Group in June 2014
Expedia Local Expert: Resource for finding and scheduling local activities/events. Local Expert (LX) provides over 100 concierge desks at different hotel and retail locations around the world available for face-to-face or virtual client interactions
Expedia CruiseShipCenters: North American seller of cruises and vacation packages, consisting of a network of independent franchises with over 240 locations and 5k employees in North America
SilverRail: Purchased by Expedia in August 2017 for $148mm following a commercial partnership with Egencia since 2010 and with Expedia UK since 2016
Expedia Media Solutions: Company’s digital marketing unit that connects travel and non-travel companies with targeted audiences across Expedia’s network of sites. Monetizes internal user data and creates custom marketing campaigns for clients
Primary competitors are the supplier-direct websites and other OTAs such as Booking.com (US and Europe), Booking owned Priceline.com (US), CheapOair (North America), Ctrip (Asia), Lastminute.com Group (Europe), and various regional players/ start-ups. Airbnb and Google are emerging threats
  Trivago: This is EXPE’s second largest reportable segment and operates as a travel metasearch engine
EXPE took a 62% stake in Trivago in 2012 for $632mm. The company is listed on NASDAQ under TRVG in December 2016. Expedia retained 65% of voting rights and 60% of economic rights. The search engine generates about a $1.2bn in revenue with about a third of that being generated intra-company
Trivago provides localized hotel search from various providers, some of which are competitors to its parent company. The search engine had over 2bn visits in the last 12 months and has more than 1.8mm properties available for comparison
Metasearch business model involves advertisers - in this case OTAs and hotels - paying the search engine for referrals generated to their sites on a cost-per-click (CPC) basis. Costs per click typically range from $0.75 to $2.00 on clicks through general metasearch listings but can vary depending on many factors like location and dates. Referrals made through “pop-under” ads cost $0.25-$0.50, less than general CPC rates because these are considered a lower quality user experience and have a lower booking conversion rate
Primary competitors are TripAdvisor (TRIP), Kayak (BKNG), Qunar (Ctrip), and Google Hotel Finder/Google Flights
  Egencia: Reportable segment launched in June 2008 that provides managed travel services to corporate customers in North America, Europe and the Asia Pacific regions
Egencia charges its clients account management fees and transaction fees for booked products. In 2016, over $1T was spent on global business travel according to the World Travel & Tourism Council, a segment where Egencia is one of the largest corporate travel providers with almost $7bn in gross bookings and ~$500mm in revenue (about 6% of Expedia’s sales)
Primary competitors are American Express Global Business Travel, Carlson Wagonlit Travel, Thomas Cook, BCD Travel, inhouse managed travel departments
  HomeAway: HomeAway was purchased by Expedia for $3.9bn in December 2015  ($1b in cash, $@.9bn in stock, a 19% premium)
The reportable segment offers entire home rentals labelled “alternative accommodations” through its brands which primarily include: HomeAway, VRBO, VacationRentals.com, and BedandBreakfast.com
HomeAway and its affiliates link homeowners and property managers with travellers looking to stay in vacation homes. The segment has over 2mm listings across 90 countries with about 75% bookable online. The segment accounts for about 10% of Expedia’s gross bookings and 9% of its revenue. HomeAway supplies the alternative accommodation inventory for Expedia.com and Hotels.com. 
Initially, HomeAway was not involved in the transaction between property managers and travelers. Instead, the company generated revenue through annual listing fees starting at $349 per listing, essentially acting as an online classified for vacation homes. Eventually, it added a performance based fee option ranging from 10-13% per booking which was successful in attracting owners who rent out their properties less frequently than dedicated vacation home landlords. After acquiring HomeAway, Expedia decided to start monetizing the guest side of the transaction, charging a traveller fee between 4% and 10% per booking (up to $499). Under the new revenue structure, HomeAway went from an effective 3-4% commission rate to an effective 10-12% commission, closer to its alternative listing peers Airbnb (10-12%) and booking.com (15%). Other competitors include Homestay and Outdoorsy (RV rental marketplace)
There is upside to the take rates from here,  they think it can go closer to 15% and perhaps higher as takes rates in general across Internet companies go up as they provide more services and value for customers and suppliers
  In 2018, approximately 38% of EXPE’s worldwide gross bookings and 45% of worldwide revenue were through international points of sale compared to just 21% for both worldwide gross bookings and revenue in 2005. The Company has a goal of generating more than two-thirds of total revenue from outside of the U.S. 
  Investment Thesis
Simplistically, Expedia basically operates in an oligopoly, and in a secular growing market that is gaining share (from offline) with much TAM and room for growth
Growing revs at around 10%  CAGR, EBITDA low teens CAGR, and EPS in the high teens CAGR trading at a cheap valuation on a historical, relative, and absolute basis (9.3x EV/EBITDA, and 17x P/E 1 year out)
That’s a great combination of attributes
  Large and growing global travel market that is still underpenetrated which will drive sustainable double-digit top-line growth for EXPE
Phocuswright estimates that only 50% of hotels and vacation rentals are listed online. Of the listed hotels, vast majority of room nights are not yet sold through OTAs, they are sold through the wholesale channel (travel agencies, tour operators) 6-9 months in advance for steep discounts of 30-40%  
Expedia has 1mm lodging properties on their site and thinks there are 6-7mm in total when you include alternative accommodations
Corporate  travel online penetration is around 90%,  so there’s room for leisure travel to get up towards that # long term 
The overall travel opportunity remains significant at $1.7T in 2019
Market share is defined as nights booked as a % of total inventory (i.e. take all hotels and vacation rentals on the OTA platforms, take the number of rooms they have and multiply by 365)
Assuming full occupancy, EXPE only has ~6% market share, BNKG has ~9% market share
Assuming 70% occupancy rate, EXPE’s market share is still under 10%. This does not include offline hotels 
Phocuswright projects that the market share of OTAs will double by 2020
Also, there are many adjacent areas like car, activities, cruise, etc. They still have much opportunity internationally (LatAm, Asia) where they are nascent,  as well as luxury hotels:


  Margin expansion potential will drive mid-teens EBITDA growth for EXPE
EXPE’s EBITDA margin is less than half of BKNG’s margins (18% vs. 40%). Part of that is due to structural differences
As EXPE evolves its revenue mix (increased emphasis on hotels vs. air and an increased emphasis on Europe vs. North America) and works to improve its direct bookings, I believe there is significant upside to EXPE margins from a more efficient deployment of resources, investments, and marketing spend
EXPE has higher mix of airline bookings, which carry lower revenue margins than the more profitable hotel bookings
The benefit of this is EXPE can put together an entire trip (air, hotel, car rental) and could be an attractive option for consumers looking for one-stop shop with more competitive pricing. Expedia is the only global OTA with a full range of travel products, which differentiates it vs. peers 
EXPE is currently over-indexed to the US, where hotel chains are significantly more consolidated, command more of the profits, and leave less margin for the OTA
EXPE is making a big push to grow internationally, where the hotel industry is much more fragmented and thus have better margin potential
EXPE has invested a lot of resources in technology upgrades that should help reaccelerate revenue and improve efficiency and profitability
The Company has been migrating its infrastructure to the cloud (a multi year and expensive effort) 
This will allow for significantly faster code deployment, better optimization driven by AI, personized search results  
Once complete, it will significantly reduce capital intensity and improve cash flow generation
Unlike the other internet giants, the OTAs don’t have the same regulatory noise or pressure
  Catalysts / Upside
  As Expedia ramps up properties and room supply, there will be several cascading benefits: 1) greater accommodation inventory leading to 2) improved selection and shopping experience leading to 3) higher conversion rate which leads to 4) greater marketing efficiency and ultimately higher operating margins.   In addition, benefits from the cloud migration could drive better customer experience and faster product rollouts. 
Revenue: room to grow / improve
EXPE now has 1mm properties, where BKNG was two years ago, but only 50% of room nights  
There is significant room for room night growing by improving effectiveness of reaching customers. So far, Company is happy with the increased level of penetration for new properties added 
Incremental gross booking and FCF dollars from HomeAway as Expedia continues to integrate HomeAway inventory on its core platforms and take down friction 
Optionality for faster product innovation following full transition to cloud
Margins: rising
Changes in marketing spend (better mix and less reliance on search – which is effective but expensive) should drive more efficient spend and better margins
Allocating more to brand marketing and reducing costlier digital advertising 
They spent 2018 increasing ad spend and testing out other channels.  That YoY increased ad spend pressure will abate in 2019 and beyond as they’re done with that investment and will get leverage on sales and marketing going forward
Marketing spend leverage driven by rising conversion on improved shopping experience
Cloud transition expenses will abate in 2021
In 2018 incremental cloud expenses $141 million (compared to $1.97bn in EBITDA) and go to ~$250 million in 2019 (compared to $2.27bn of EBITDA).  Excluding cloud expenses, adjusted EBITDA growth would be approximately 400 basis points higher. 
As these incremental cloud expenses abate, there is a sizeable lift to EBITDA and margins
A good share of their compute will be in the cloud as of the end of 2019, but there will be more to move in 2020.  
Into 2021, they’ll annualize the step-up in 2020 and be a lot closer to that just normalized rate and tech expenses will growing inline with the business. 
Continued compounding
With continued low teens EBITDA growth and high teens EPS growth CAGR,  while the multiple is on the low end of its historical range. I think the stock can compound value in the high teens with continued earnings growth while holding the multiple steady
Liberty Expedia transaction stock for stock transaction proposed on 2/4/2019,  still being negotiated. Maybe very slightly accretive (by 0-1%)
Expedia has offered to acquire Liberty Expedia in a stock for stock transaction, under which LEXEA/B holders would receive EXPE shares in a tax-free transaction. 
Expedia has offered market price (a 5.7% discount to NAV), while Liberty has countered with a 1.4% premium to NAV.
Liberty Expedia is basically a holdco for Expedia shares.  It has 23.9mm shares of EXPE
They own 16.2% of the equity and have 53% voting interest 
i.e. 11.1mm common shares (one vote per share) and 12.8mm Class B shares (ten votes per share) 
Also owns Bodybuilder.com (unclear value, did $243mm of LTM rev, but declining 20% YoY and burning a tiny bit of cash)
$3223mm net debt
This doesn’t change the net share count or capital structure,  but it would clean up the convoluted ownership structure, which is a small positive.  If they can get it at a discount to NAV, it would be very slightly accretive as well (by 0-1%)
Conservatism / beats:  likely can continue
New management has lately established a track record of beating
The CEO (Mark Okerstrom) was appointed in 8/2017.  Not too surprisingly, on the subsequent 2 quarters after being appointed, the stock was down 15.5-16% on each earnings print as he rebased expectations. 
Over the last 4 earnings since, they beat comfortably and the stock has risen 
He joined EXPE in 2006 and became CFO in 2011.  In 2014 he became EVP of Operations and CFO. Prior to that he worked at Bain, UBS, and a law firm
Management’s 2019 EBITDA growth guidance of +10-15% includes conservatism around the macro picture.  Since I think the macro will improve, that’s part of my bullishness vs. consensus 
At the end of 2017 and through 2018, growth expectations in the OTA space were re-based lower, and expenses higher as they embarked on more brand marketing spend and cloud transition spend.  Now that expectations have been reset and they’re getting over those investments, they can get back to beating and raising
New HQ costs
EXPE is spending $250mm of their new HQ in 2018, $475mm in 2019, and $75mm in 2020.  FCF will look better as that capex comes down 
AirBnB IPO
That could highlight the SOTP value at Expedia, in particular the value of HomeAway (which has been a great acquisition for EXPE) 
From a macro perspective, I’m bullish the global consumer and travel
The US/China trade deal is likely to get done, and Chinese stimulus is starting flow through
In turn, that will boost European GDP (Europe is highly tied to China)
And all the above will boost the US economy as well
Hence Expedia and global travel will be helped as well 
The dollar will probably weaken as well, which is good since 45% of their revs are outside the US.  There would be an accounting translation benefit 
Share buyback
The company is also supporting their shares through buybacks.  They’ve shrunk share count by 2-3% YoY over the last year
737 max plane issues get fixed and/or airlines swap out planes 
  Risks:
Competition
Ad pricing pressure from Google
Google could push organic search results further down and increase cost of doing business for OTAs as described above
As mentioned above,  Google is very unlikely to replace OTAs since they’d have to hire a lot of bodies and spend much money to do all the customer service, call centers, hotel relationship, etc.  And besides, then they’d have to compete entrenched and dominant competition, and it would cannibalize their own search revenue 
In the last 1-2 years, the OTAs have realized that aggressively competing for keywords against each other is not a good idea and have tried to shift their budget elsewhere to higher ROI channels like TV.  That’s a good sign and partly helps reflect the oligopolistic industry structure 
Online and offline travel service providers
AirBnB is obviously disruptive from an alternative basis and concerns they may get into Hotel (e.g. with a recent small acquisition of HotelTonight) and maybe start bidding more for keywords
AirBnB faces a steep battle to get into Hotels since the site is obviously focused on non-hotel bookings, it would take a long time to scale 
HotelTonight is around a low single % the size of Booking and Expedia in terms of revs, rooms, bookings, etc.  It’ll take a long time for them to make a dent
Hotels generally view AirBNB as a direct threat, so it’s less likely that they’ll want to partner with the enemy when they have BKGN and EXPE already   
Cyclical travel disruptions such as economic uncertainty, terror attacks, currency movements, bad weather, etc.
Although of course not apples to apples since the OTA industry was much smaller and faster growing in 2008-2009, EXPE grew revs by 10% in 2008 and +1% in 2009, and EPS +1% and +10% respectively. 
F/X
EXPE generates 45% of revenue outside of the U.S. 
BKNG’s most recent quarter called out weak macro trends in Europe. It could negatively impact EXPE’s Q2 guide 
Europe accounts for ~22% for EXPE, a similar hit would result in one point headwind to global room night growth 
However, their 2019 EBITDA growth guidance of +10-15% YoY accounts for macro weakness.  Although they admit that macro changes are hard to handicap. They note that their cost are highly variable and so they have plenty of wiggle room within that range
  Valuation:
  Valuation is compelling, for a company with a large TAM growing rev ~10% and EPS mid-to high teens % trading at 9.3x 1 year forward EBITDA and 17x 1 year forward EPS  (and 8.2x 2 year forward EV/EBITDA and 15x 2 year forward P/E)
Valuation is on the low end of its historical range over the last 5 years
EXPE mostly trades on EV/EBITDA
  Upside price target
As rev growth stabilizes (and perhaps inflects upwards from more inventory added to the site and the macro), and as margins improve (from leveraging marketing and cloud spending), the multiple should also inflect higher 
At 10x EV/EBITDA and fast forwarding 1 year (also I think the high end of their 2019 guidance is pretty achievable, which should continue), I get to a $160 stock.  Along with the 1% dividend, that’s 35% upside

  Forward 2 year EV/EBITDA multiples
 
EXPE forward 4 quarter EV/EBITDA ratio over the last 5 years using consensus
  EXPE forward 4 quarter P/E ratio over the last 5 years using consensus
    Comparison of EXPE and BKNG
Technicals
EXPE price chart since 2014
Expectations were heavily reset at the end of 2017 and through 2018 as they changed their marketing strategy and invested in more brand advertising and cloud computing.  Plus growth rates slowed 
Technicals wise, the stock is in a bull pennant pattern, which is usually a positive sign and resolves this current wedge higher.  An upside breakout from this pennant roughly targets upside to $180 
  EXPE Price chart since 2005 – long term compounder type of chart.  Consolidating for 4 years, and eventually should regain the trend up
I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

Buy Ambac Financial Group common stock, ticker AMBC. 
The range of outcomes for the value appears to have favorable skew, with only 20% downside and 150% upside.  This is a counter intuitive situation, because Ambac's main operating subsidiary is characterized by the reverse (that is the nature of bond insurance) and is the source of the opportunity in the common.  Judging all the probabilities is a challenge, but I consider the adverse scenario unlikely. 
Investors and accountants alike are uncertain about the value of AMBC.  During the prior 52 weeks, the stock has been as low as $13, and as high as $27.  During the past three years, adjusted book value per share has fluctuated between a low of $1 deficit and a high of $32.  Given the uncertainty, it makes sense to review the assets, beginning with the most certain, and proceeding to the less certain and contingent ones. 
I will skip a history of Ambac and a description of the business.  Those can be found readily, including in some highly rated posts to this community.  
$12+ per share of net asset value at AFG
$8.50 per share of cash and investments
$3.50 per share of tolling payment receivables
$6.00 per share in potential value from $1.4 billion of NOLs allocated to AFG
AFG.1) $8.47 per share of cash and investments
Ambac Financial Group (AFG) is a holding company, and most assets and liabilities are accounts of the main operating subsidiary, Ambac Assurance Corporation (AAC).  AAC has large existing liabilities and massive contingent liabilities.  So the net worth of AAC is highly uncertain.  But AFG holds $381 million of investments ad $4.2 billion of net operating loss carryforwards with no debt.  A description of AFG's assets in on page 63 of the Form 10-Q filed November 8, 2017 and on page 24 of the ""Third Quarter 2017 Investor Presentation.""
AFG holds $98 million of liquid assets consisting of asset backed and short-term securities. 
AFG holds $204 million of AAC surplus notes (including accrued interest) and $6 million of AAC insured securities, also known as deferred amounts or DPOs. As part of the Rehabilitation Exit Support Agreement, AFG will exchange these for $128 million of secured notes and $105 million of surplus notes.  The former are secured by the first $1.4 billion of proceeds from litigation to enforce AAC's contractual representations and warranties, they have a cash coupon of 3-month LIBOR plus 5.0% (~6.5% today), and a five year maturity.  This should make them liquid.  The latter will continue to accrue interest at 5.1%, and AFG has agreed to delay selling, perhaps for as long as until June 8, 2020.  This makes them illiquid.  Converting the $105 million of remaining AAC surplus notes to cash will depend on the net worth of AAC.  But these obligations are senior to the equity.  

AFG holds $74 million of interests in two tranches of a variable interest entity, the Corolla Trust, that are secured by $350 million par of AAC junior surplus notes.  The trust issued $300 million of senior secured notes to third parties and AFG retained a subordinated ""residual equity interest"" on the remaining $50 million of principal.  After several years of accrued interest, AFG's total residual equity interest claim is $65 million carried at a fair value of $34 million.  In July 2017, AFG repurchased senior secured notes of the Trust with a par amount of $45 million ($55 million total claim with $10 million of accrued interest) that is carried at a fair value of $40 million.
The trend in AFG's ""cash and investments"" has been stable, outside of $120 million increase since the end of 2015, mostly due to $100 million of tax tolling payments.  This is because AFG's operating expenses, around $10 million per year, are roughly covered by up to $5 million per year from AAC (after March 2017 this reimbursement is at the sole discretion of the rehabilitator with a $4 million cap) and investment income. 
AFG.2) $3.50 per share of future tolling payments for use of net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs)
Ambac accumulated a tax net operating loss (NOL) exceeding $6 billion, primarily from over $10 billion (billion with a B) in pretax losses in 2007 and 2008.  In 2013, the company emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection with a Reorganization Plan that stipulated how the NOLs would be shared intercompany between AFG and AAC.  A substantial portion of the NOLs were allocated to AAC ($2.8 billion remain), and as AAC utilizes the NOLs it makes tolling payments to AFG pursuant to a formula.  A description of how the tolling payents are calculated is on page 53 of Form 10-Q filed November 8, 2017 and on page 26 of the ""Third Quarter 2017 Investor Presentation.""
So far, AFG has received $100 million in cash tolling payments from AAC.  In May 2016, AFG received $71 million, and in May 2017, AFG received $29 million  AFG can collect $136 million in additional cash tolling payments, or $3.50 per share.  This is sort of an off balance sheet receivable because the DTA is fully offset by a valuation allowance and DTL.  
Tolling payments will pause, however, because AAC generated new NOLs (after September 30, 2011) of $254 million in 2017 that must be utilized exclusively by AAC before tolling payments related to the old NOLs (before September 30, 2011) are resumed.  By my calculation, AAC generated $209 million of taxable income in 2016, $834 million in 2015, and over $40 million in 2014.    
AFG.3) Up to $6 per share of deferred tax assets, undiscounted
Ambac has $4.2 billion of net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs).  AAC was allocated a majority, which now equal $2.8 billion, and the usage of these NOLs drives the tolling payments to AFG described previously. AFG was allocated a minority, which now equal $1.4 billion.  The NOLs begin to expire in 2029.  Because the holding company does not have a source of taxable income, the AFG NOLs have not been utilized and there is no DTA net of the valuation allowance and DTL.  
Ambac is pursuing business transactions that could utilize the NOLs. While the likelihood of succeeding is remote, similar economic incentives have attracted capital and savvy investors before.  Recall that KKR led a nearly $600 million capital raise for WMI Holdings for the purpose of acquiring a business to utilize Washington Mutual's $6 billion of NOLs.  Based on my research and discussion with bankers, the probability that AFG can realize much of the $6.50 per share in potential future value is remote.  But it is a contingent asset that represents upside, and therefore worth mentioning.  Obviously, just because I cannot figure out how Ambac might realize value does not mean they will not. 
Downside looks like $11.50, or 20% from recent prices around $14.50.  This could be lower if the $1.65 per share of interests in the Corolla Trust are further impaired (they are carried at 56% of par already).  This could be higher if the $6+ per share of deferred tax assets can be realized.  
While the financial reporting is complicated, the business is not.  The upside is limited to the net asset value, plus any contingent assets.  Initially, the upside scenario from AAC does not look compelling. 
$200 per share of assets
$135 per share of investments
$41 per share of legal recoveries
$18 per share of residual interests
$6 per share of future cash installment premiums
$200 per share of liabilities
$151 per share of claims
$34 per share of debt
$15 per share of preferred shares
$0 per share of net assets
But the accounting is misleading, and material adjustments should be considered in construction of an upside scenario. This yields upside from AAC of $24 per share.
AAC.1) $135 per share of investments – no adjustments
In most cases, Ambac collects cash from the borrower at the outset of the financial guaranty contract.  These proceeds are invested in a portfolio of securities to cover AAC’s operating expenses and to meet claim liabilities.  Today, AAC’s investment portfolio has a carrying value of $6.1 billion and yields 6.1%.  The investments are carried at fair value, and most are Level 2 assets.  Details of every security can be found in AAC’s statutory filings, and the company supplies the information in a Microsoft Excel file on its website under Investor Relations.    
AAC.2) $41 per share of legal recoveries – with $15 per share of upside
Ambac estimates that it will recover $1.8 billion from underwriters, primarily Bank of America and Nomura, for claims payments that Ambac made on void policies.  The estimate is based on various scenarios and different probability weightings, and is recorded on the balance sheet as a contra-liability that reduces gross loss reserves.
Technically speaking, when AAC issued financial guaranty insurance policies covering the payments on residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) underwritten by banks (i.e. Countrywide), the policies included agreements and policies that describe various representations and warranties made by the underwriter, as well as remedies available to the insurer (i.e. AAC) in the event of a breach of those representations and warranties.  Because many RMBS performed well below expectations, Ambac began to investigate the underwriting and discovered that over 60% of the loans were in breach of representations and warranties.
Bank of America settled with the other two major bond insurers already.  In 2011, Bank of America settled with Assured Guaranty for over $1.1 billion, and in 2013, Bank of America settled with MBIA for $1.6 billion.  A possible explanation for why Bank of America has not settled yet with Ambac is that BAC considered Ambac in a weak negotiating position given that Ambac utilized bankruptcy protection and AAC is still in rehabilitation (heightened regulatory supervision and making certain claims payments only partially in cash).  AAC is on the verge of exiting rehabilitation, however. 
For two reasons, this particular asset could be worth more than $1.8 billion.  First, the $1.8 billion probability weighted estimate is significantly less than the amount Ambac seeks to recover.  If Ambac is seeking $2.75 billion and settles for 80%, or $2.2 billion, then it will record a gain of $400 million or $8 per share.  Second, the $1.8 billion does not include recoveries for fraudulent inducement.  If Ambac recovers $300 million, then it will record a gain of $300 million, or $7 per share. 
With 45 million shares and significant net operating loss carryforwards, every $100 million of recoveries in excess of the $1.8 billion book value is worth $2.20 per share of value, or 15% of the current share price.  So there is significant upside potential for the common equity shareholders.
AAC.3) $146 per share of claims liabilities -- $5-6 per share upside
Ambac’s claim liabilities include (a) $3.0 billion of unpaid claims, (b) $0.8 billion of accrued interest on unpaid claims, and (c) $3.0 billion of estimated future claims. 
The first two are referred to as deferred amounts, which total $3.8 billion.  Ambac negotiated to satisfy these obligations are 93.5%, which will reduce the liability by $250 million, or $5-6 per share.  Ambac has repurchased $1.6 billion of this obligation.  The liability remains gross of the purchases at $3.8 billion, and the carrying value of Ambac-insured RMBS (of which deferred amounts is a component) is $2.2 billion with a yield of 10%. 
The $3.0 billion of estimated future claims could also be overstated.  The trend has certainly been for Ambac to revise this estimate lower.  Four years ago, Ambac’s reserve ratio was 20% and today it is only 16%.  Another 1% reduction would equal $60 million, or more than $1 per share.     
AAC.4) $47 per share of debt and preferred shares – upside of $3 per share
Debt includes $755 million of surplus notes and $332 million of accrued interest for a total of $1.1 billion.  The rehabilitation exit plan calls for these notes to receive new claims equal to 93.5%, resulting in upside of nearly $2 per share.
Debt includes $350 million of junior surplus notes and $94 million of accrued interest.  Ambac owns 30% of these notes, carried at a fair value of 56% of par plus accrued.  If the asset is worth the liability, that would cause upside of nearly $60 million, or more than $1 per share.
Ambac has $660 million of preferred shares that are carried as a noncontrolling interest at $264 million.  Further upside could come from repurchasing these at a discount to par.    
Upside to $36 per share from a combination of $12 per share for AFG and $24 per share for AAC. 
$215 per share of assets
$135 per share of investments
$57 per share of legal recoveries
$18 per share of residual interests
$6 per share of future cash installment premiums
$192 per share of liabilities
$146 per share of claims
$31 per share of debt
$15 per share of preferred shares
$24 per share of net assets
The main risk to the value of AAC (and AMBC) is that Ambac has insured Puerto Rico public finance obligations equal to $9.5 billion of net principal and interest.  The financial obligations are clearly detailed in the company’s investor presentation on Puerto Rico exposures.  The company has $801 million of loss reserves.  
The key insight is that Ambac has purchased 40% of the largest exposure, $7.3 billion of Senior Sales Tax Revenue bonds (COFINA) and at current market prices the remaining 60% could be acquired for under $600 million (10% of the investment portfolio).  In addition, Ambac has purchased 24% of the second largest exposure, $1.0 billion of Infrastructure Financing Special Tax Revenue (PRIFA).
  It appears to me that Ambac has a much higher reserve ratio and much smaller immediate cash obligations that MBIA, and MBIA recently completed a $250 million share repurchase.  
Note also the series of insider buying recently.

2021-02-21,queegs,0032.HK,Cross-Harbour Holdings,https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/Cross-Harbour_Holdings/4279255793,625000000.0,13.0,"Description
Cross-Harbour Holdings (0032.HK or CH) is an asset in transition, from a highly cash-generative infrastructure (Hong Kong tolls on tunnels) asset to a portfolio of financial assets. This transition has obscured intrinsic value. Moreover, the transition presents a couple different possible catalysts for realizing the intrinsic value that is much larger than market value.
  Despite the meaningful market cap, the traded float has decreased considerably as a result of the recent tender. That might make this more accessible for PAs and smaller funds. That said, the valuation gap is sufficiently large here, and the non-controlled float still substantial, that there should still be considerable opportunity here.
  CH has been written up twice in VIC before, once by manatee in 2015 and once by chewy in 2019. I think both writeups (especially manatee’s) do a fine job of describing the business as it has existed for most of its life, so I encourage you to skim those if you want more background. But my aim here is to make that unnecessary. Here I’ll instead be focusing on: a portfolio valuation (including significant upward valuation in book value due to portfolio assets), recent corporate actions, and potential catalysts.
  CH has consisted of a number of different transportation-related assets in HK: the early operator of the Cross-Harbour tunnel, then the operator of the Western-Harbour tunnel, operator of Cairn’s tunnel, a driver’s education business, and an electronic toll technology licensing business. The majority of the cash flows have come from CH’s share of the Western Harbour concession, which expires mid 2023, at which point the cash flows of the business should plummet. The overhang of the disappearing cash stream is a major contributor to the opportunity here: both by discouraging potential investors, and also representing a catalyst for recognizing the considerable portfolio value.
  As a starting point for our analysis, we’ll use the company’s reported book value from its 2020 semiannual report (in billions of HKD):
== Cash and ST deposits: 2.07
== Current financial assets: 2.46 [listed equities, debt, and funds]
== non-Current financial assets: 2.74 [marking other non-financial assets, like PP&E, the interest in the Western Harbour, and other interests, to 0]
== Total liabilities: 0.67
  I’ve excluded any value from the remaining time on the Western Harbour tunnel concession, as well as the motor school and toll tech business, as I will attempt to account for their value separately. Using a method similar to manatee in the 2015 writeup, in the remaining legs of the concession, we conservatively see toll revenue of 750m (H2 2020), 1.5B (2021), 1.8B (2022), 1.1B (first 7 months of 2023), after accounting for Opex, Capex, and taxes, and attributing the half that belongs to CH, we get CH cash flow share of 280m, 560m, 676m and 376m, discounted at 8%, for an NPV of 1.5B HKD. These numbers are somewhat conservative in that 2021 revenues are kept in-line with the pandemic-stricken 2020 levels, despite early 2021 traffic patterns having risen from 2020. The motor school and toll tech revenues have been resilient through the pandemic, translating to 170m in earnings, which we conservatively value on an 8x P/E for 1.36B in value.
  One additional adjustment to book value: in the recent crazed market environment the financial assets held by CH have appreciated substantially. Most notably, their large holdings in Evergrande Health (0708.HK) have increased 500%, translating to 2.7B HKD in additional portfolio gains. Although it is in principle possible they have reduced their holdings through the run-up, we have very strong reason to believe that is not the case based on available shareholding data in HK. Marking the rest of the portfolio with market prices, yields a net gain in book value of 2.58B HKD. Though it’s worth noting that much of this appreciation occurred in 2021, while the upcoming earnings will only reflect part of these gains through YE 2020.
  This yields a base case 12.1B HKD in intrinsic value, or 32.46 HKD per share, compared to last of 13 HKD.
  So there’s a substantial valuation gap. Now why (and when and how) do we expect that to be realised? As evidenced by the substantial Evergrande Health shareholdings, CH has not shown itself to be the friendliest stewards of capital, at least by our old-fashioned value standards.
  Between a few different entities (Rose Dynamics, Chongqing Industrial, Cheung Chu Kiu, the chairman), 74.57% of the shares are effectively controlled by the chairman. He consolidated most of these holdings in Rose Dynamics through a recent tender at 14 HKD per share. We believe this tender was motivated by 3 basic forces: 1. The ability to purchase stock considerably below intrinsic value, 2. With the imminent curtailment of the major source of cash flow, the entity has outlived its purpose and is likely to be restructured, and 3. Activist attention (from Black Crane and Lanyon) in early 2020
  The activist play essentially highlighted the obvious dynamic that’s suggested by the discrepancy between balance sheet and market value. The funds attempted to gain board seats and push to distribute via dividend the liquid assets. Their effort was unsuccessful, which does not seem surprising when considering the quantity of shares presumed to be held by associates of the Chairman. Only 4 months after the unsuccessful activist play, the Chairman launched the tender.
  It warrants briefly discussing the portfolio. Portions of it seem to be invested in volatile, small-cap, unfortunate HK listcos. But also large portions seem to be invested prudently in tame, low vol debt and equity funds. The mismatch is confusing, and doesn’t offer us confidence that there’s value-minded investors at the helm. But we’re at least reassured that the more questionable elements of the portfolio have historically been a minority of the holdings (and have recently taken on a larger role only due to the impact of the unrealised gains). We’ve spent some time tracing through the questionable equity investments (in the spirit of David Webb), looking for evidence of wealth being siphoned off via fraudulent investment. We see no evidence of that, and indeed consider the risk of it much lower, now that the aggregated stake of the controller is transparent.
  What comes next? The Western Harbour concession expires in July 2023, and expectations are that the government will assume the revenue risk, similar to their role on other tunnels in Hong Kong. It’s possible CH could remain involved as an operator, but this seems unlikely, and an operator like Serco, who currently operates the Cross-Harbour Tunnel (for which this company is named, and had its earlier involvement lapse), will take over. So you’re left with CH with nearly 11B HKD in relatively liquid equity (already roughly 9B), with comparatively minor ongoing earnings from the remaining motor school and electronic tool businesses. By far the most sensible outcome would be to liquidate most of the investment portfolio, dividend the proceeds, and then delist the small residual OpCo (or, alternately, leave it as a microcap). A less desirable, but plausible scenario, would be to deploy the excess liquidity into future infrastructure investments. The company has shown no significant appetite for this in the preceding years, so while we acknowledge this possibility, it does not seem likely. Although this is not the preferred scenario, the record of capital allocation (on infrastructure, contrasted to listed equities) seems strong, and accordingly we would project strong results. The least desirable scenario is status quo -- that CH remains as a thinly-veiled investment vehicle participating in puzzling private and public investments, doomed to trade at a significant discount. An intermediate outcome would be for the chairman to pursue a squeeze/take-out, to assume control of the missing 25%. They could do so at a significant premium to market value, but still significant discount to intrinsic value, thus still extracting substantial value
  To be very clear, we don’t have any special insight into management’s plans here. We interpret the recent consolidating tender as both a positive and negative sign: negative in that it indicates a somewhat adversarial relationship between management and public shareholders; positive in that it seems consistent with a restructuring, and given the current valuation gap, many forms of restructuring should translate to the recognition of value. Put another way, the setup is bookended by the recent tender, and the looming cessation of the main tunnel business. And between those bookends there seem to be many potential catalysts in the form of CH clarifying its future plans. One such catalyst is the upcoming annual report and subsequent AGM. Again, it is possible that we get to July 2023 without clarification, but that seems not a favorite, and we’d argue we’re being well compensated for that risk. More concretely, at current prices, each of the next 2 earnings events should reveal substantial (1B HKD through 2020 YE, followed by 2B HKD for H1 2021) portfolio gains, which will dwarf earlier earnings, and potentially draw attention and catalyze investors motivated by a SOTP logic as outlined here.
  The motor school and toll tech secondary seem to be reasonably high-quality, albeit small, businesses. We’ve assigned what seems like a very conservative multiple to them, and mostly not focused on them, given they seem very ancillary to the realization of value here.
  One other encouraging data point on the potential for unlocking value: if you look back at the late 90s, early 00s, you can see periods of time with very high dividends. Although management was different at that time, this does represent another period where the business was in transition from Central-Harbour focused to Western-Harbour focused, and it resulted in the return of a significant portion of the market cap to shareholders. There are no assurances this will be repeated, but we consider it another encouraging datapoint towards our thesis.
  In brief: CH presents the opportunity to invest in a bizarre portfolio at 40c on the dollar, with a near-term potential catalyst of the market realizing that portfolio has appreciated substantially, and a few medium-term catalysts of what is already substantively the case, becoming structurally clear, that CH is a portfolio shell no longer serving its original purpose. There’s no assurances on timeline, and it’s certainly possible that we’re sitting here in 5 years with a portfolio that’s lost 25%, and no meaningful action has been taken. But when we consider the many different possibilities that result in upside, and the incentives of the controlling stakeholder, we find this setup attractive
  Risks: Two big ones, that can’t be understated:
== We haven’t seen evidence that minority shareholders are particularly aligned with the controlling stakeholder. There are plenty of ways for them to short-change us on value here. One mitigant: the chairman’s stake is so large, the risk/reward would not seem to justify much risk-taking in extracting value from the minority (more cynically, much of that extraction occurred in last year’s tender). A further mitigant: most scenarios involve the controlling stakeholder limiting our upside, but we still preserve a healthy return in most of those outcomes
  == Bizarre capital allocation. It’s really hard to defend some of the equity investments (0718.HK, 0279.HK, 0622.HK, 2066.HK, 1387.HK). Even though they’ve been more than bailed out by the 0708.HK home run, we are troubled by these investments and think it’s reasonable to charge a significant haircut on the portfolio as a result

The private equity bubble has officially burst – so how can we short private markets in the public market?  More or less every recent vintage is now massively under-water (read: worthless).  More importantly – the sponsors have been running around like drunken sailors for the past 5 years getting anything and everything passed by auditors and creditors as it relates to EBITDA.  Sponsor multiples were on average 12x “EBITDA” in recent years with 6x debt but look under the hook and the truth is that EBITDA was inflated to the tune of 20-30%.  The result? With IWM back at levels from 5-years ago and with PE sporting only 2-3x the debt levels of the IWM, PE is worthless.  And no, we don’t think sponsors are getting any bailouts when even cities and munis are going to be in-line waiting for hand-outs.  To channel our inner Bernie - we need to build hospitals and improve our infrastructure now – not bail out billionaires.  Thanks to PE managers, pensions and foundations have lost anywhere from 10-20% of assets – permanently.  In the coming months they will realize this sad truth. 
Private equity owned companies employ over 6 million Americans and as job losses hit the market, a disproportionate share of job losses will fall on employees of PE companies.  Not only are these portfolios wipe-outs, but thanks to the leverage levels in PE backed companies, job losses will be staggering as PE funds do what they can to keep current on debt service.  We believe the PE model as it exists today will collapse due to shifting regulatory views of an industry that has walked away with billions of dollars while its investors and its stakeholders have lost it all.  Expect Warren to have a main role in a Biden administration – and expect PE to be regulated in an extreme manner.  Thanks to PE we have exacerbated a crisis because PE leaves companies with no “rainy day fund” through wonderfully thoughtful moves such as aggressive special dividend recaps.  Public companies were quick to create COVID-19 messaging while PE firms were quick to ignite layoffs.  A regulatory super storm is brewing.
We speak to PE managers who still have their heads in the sky and are not aware of how dire the business outlook is for them on a go forward basis.  Managers have long played games with their marks, but with the IWM wiping out 5 years of gains, managers will have to now begin taking mark downs on their portfolios.  Worse yet, the mythical “PE capital on the sidelines” will now have to be deployed into existing companies to help keep them afloat.  Does anyone reasonably expect PE funds to hold onto their 2% management fees on committed capital while they sit on zombie portfolios that will at best return cost over the next decade?  Will PE funds continue to draw monitoring and advisory fees that are little more than hidden fees LPs should have long removed?  We expect deals will be re-cut in material ways.  Here is the dirty secret – in 2009 many PE funds were forced to MASSIVELY cut their existing and forward fees to hold onto investors.  At the end of this rout, anywhere from 50-75% of PE funds will be gone.
One way to play this theme is obviously the GPs (Apollo, KKR, Blackstone etc).  Some of these managers deserve to be investigated and shut down for their tactics (more on this another day), but many are in the “too big to disappear” category.  We are proposing a less crowded alternative that trades at a nosebleed valuation and that has existential risk – Hamilton Lane.  Hamilton Lane is effectively a fund of funds – they charge a little more than 50bps to steer investors into alternatives.  They also buy portfolios of existing PE assets from LPs as well as provide advice for a fee on the best PE funds to invest in.  Great business right?  Charge 50bps to steer people into PE funds, all of which simultaneously got wiped out and that layer on 200-300bps on top of Hamilton Lane’s fees. 
From an advisory perspective, we believe Hamilton Lane is also absolutely terrible. They steered investors into Abraaj years ago (~$470MM ), which ended up being  a  fraud.  We spoke with industry sources who told us it was widely known that Abraaj was a fraud and that Hamilton Lane was one of the only large tier institution that was stupid enough to fall for it.  The following Bloomberg article details the events: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-05/abraaj-investor-hamilton-lane-among-several-warned-about-fund

Hamilton Lane is trading as if it is a secular growth story when in reality it faces secular risk.  30x PE multiple for HLNE is insanity.  The back book of carried interest will likely be wiped out, and few surviving desperate sponsors will cut deals directly with large LPs on future funds – at huge discounts.  We believe Hamilton Lane introduced smaller institutions that had no business investing in PE funds in the first place.  These smaller institutions will likely never return.
HLNE is priced as a secular grower but is in fact facing complete losses on its investment portfolio and existential risk in the future as smaller institutional investors leave PE all together or transact directly with sponsors instead of paying 55 bps for useless advice.
We think the stock should trade at a 10x PE in the new market paradigm, so think its worth at best $20/sh.

So what would be so interesting about a company that lost $10 a share over the last 5 years while revenue has fallen 40%? Franklin Covey is worth a look due to management simultaneously pulling several levers that should create shareholder value: a) material OPEX reductions b) significant change in revenue mix and margins in the mix c) continued improvement in FCF dynamics reducing inventory and CAPEX and d) a complex capital structure with a hidden asset. We believe these events combined with a non-promotional highly under-followed company with 4 divisions have left investors with a bargain. We think FC is trading at slightly less than 4x EV/EBITDA on August 2007 year end numbers assuming flat revenue.
  At current prices we think FC has $6 downside (3.4x ‘07E EV/EBITDA-CAPEX, FY year end August). Our upside target is $16 using the mid point of: sum of the parts $15.70 and 10x EV/EBITDA-CAPEX ‘07E $16.20 using what we think are fairly conservative estimates. Our estimates for the next 3 years: EBITDA ’06E $1.40, ’07E $1.75, ’08E $2.25, ‘09E $2.65 (CAPEX 10-14%+/- of EBITDA). In 2009, we think the stock could see $25-30.   
  First we think FC could get to $2.50 a share in EBITDA-CAPEX in the next 3 years on a $7 stock. Basic blocking and tackling in operating expenses alone should unlock value by paying down debt (in 2005 the Preferred’s cost .40 per share annually in interest, in 2006 cost about .20 a share, by end of 2007 we think this will be -0-). Operating expenses should come down another .20 a share in 2007 from renegotiating the EDS contract in April 2006, (FC out-sources its fulfillment processes to EDS).  So just assuming 2007 revenue is flat from 2006 we could see a 25% rise in EBITDA and significant reduction in debt. We think that revenue should increase at least 5% in 2007 with better margins on both of their divisions, so there could be upside to the 2007E.
  Description: OSBU: (Organizational Solutions Business Unit): training and consulting, both Domestic and International. International is in 100 countries with 24% EBITDA margins because of royalties from licensees. Domestic is about a 10% EBITDA margin.
CSBU (Consumer Small Business Unit): Retail 90+ stores, Internet-Catalog, and Wholesale business.
  Where the story gets more interesting is that in the 2005 annual shareholder letter the CEO writes ""we expect training and consulting (OSBU) sales to grow to as much as 65% of our total sales (on an increasing revenue base), in the coming years.""  Since the OSBU business has 16% EBITDA margins currently, FC will experience considerable margin expansion if OSBU grows from 50% of sales to 65%. To complicate matters further, International OSBU has 24% EBITDA margins and is growing faster than the Domestic side which has 10% EBITDA, so we could see further margin expansion in this division. The training and consulting sales will increase thanks to increased hiring of sales professionals and more experience within the ranks.  More experienced salespeople generate higher sales (see table below).  The average sales person has been on for 3-4 years and voluntary turnover is extremely low.

  Company has taken its break-even from $500mn in 2002 to $266mn in 2005. This should continue to drop with the recently re-negotiated contract with EDS. From 1996 through 2001 FC generated $14 in cash from operations per share and CAPEX was $8.50 a share, now CAPEX will be a fraction of what it was then with much better Free Cash Flow dynamics. The CEO should apply to be a VIC member, he has an outstanding letter to investors that is extremely clear and concise on exactly move by move he is doing to create shareholder value. Tank481 did an excellent job of identifying FC as an opportunity to buy at a discount to liquid NWC. A great deal has changed since that 2002 write up. Management has sold off five non-core businesses, closed their Provo office, did sale/leaseback of HQs (generated $32mn cash and bought back from $87mn to $37mn of their preferreds last 15 months), closed 80+ retail stores, reducing WC and CAPEX, while driving more business to their Internet Site. We believe that FC total revenue bottomed out in 2004 at $275mn. FC revenue growth on OSBU has been masked by store closings, nearly 50% of total, over last 3 years.  The turnaround is detailed below:
  2002 $83mn EBITDA loss

  The CSBU side should reach run-rate 10%+ EBITDA margins by the end of FY2006 once all planned store closures have been implemented. Store closures don’t result in a 100% loss of sales as ~20% of sales go to either other stores or internet resulting in improved margins (see table below).  The company has closed all stores where they cannot generate 100% ROI on stores, which usually equates to about $800K in annual sales per store.

  Competition:
  OSBU offers effectiveness/execution management training and consulting to businesses with over 100 employees.  FC serves 90% of Fortune100 companies and 75%+ of Fortune500 companies but we believe many of these accounts are under-penetrated.  Their newer xQ Survey offering has been very well received in the market (they haven’t seen this level of excitement since the ‘7 Habits of Highly Effective People’ release in the early 90s).  To generate new products/services, FC employs world-renowned thought-leaders such as Stephen Covey and Jim Collins (author book “Good to Great”).  FC also recruits up-and-coming thought-leaders offering to include their concepts in FC’s products and giving them a cut of the business.  Thought-leaders prefer partnering with FC instead of opening up their own consulting firm (well known brand, sales infrastructure, reduced time-to-market, etc.).  FC benefits by outsourcing their R&D.  FC doesn’t compete directly with other management consulting firms (McKinsey, Bain,etc.) because it helps its clients to execute its goals – it doesn’t develop the goals.  Its biggest competitor is IIR, (mainly in Europe) which doesn’t have the connections in the thought-leader circles, and some smaller competitors like Organizational Dynamics, Provant, and Forum Corp.  FC estimates that the total market is worth $6bn in annual revenue and is highly fragmented with biggest companies having between $100-400mn in annual revenue.

http://www.franklincovey.com/about/investor/stories/investools_cs.html
  CSBU competitors are DayTimer, At-a-Glance, and Day Runner. We think that FC should be able to do well given 15,000,000 people use Franklin Covey Planners world-wide.  Another way CSBU differentiates itself from the competitors is offering in-store training events for small businesses.  This is a recent initiative with an estimated 5.7mn small businesses in the US.  Franklin Covey has built incredible brand recognition also thanks to Dr. Covey’s book 7 Habits of Highly Effective People (having sold well over 20,000,000 copies worldwide) and numerous other books like ""the 8th Habit"". FC has frequent symposiums around the country with Jack Welch from GE, Dr. Covey, and other famous motivational speakers.
  Management
  Bob Whitman CEO, has been with the company for ten years as board member and six as CEO. When things got tough Bob passed on a salary for three years in exchange for 1.6mn options with a strike of $14 which was ~100% above where the stock was at the time of this deal. Bob is the Co-founder of private equity firm Hampstead Group and has significant expertise in turnaround situations.
    What is the business worth?
  a) Sum of Parts
  OSBU: FC paid $160mn cash for this business in 1997, when it had $100mn in revenue and $4mn in EBIT. This business bottomed out in 2004 with $109mn in revenue. Today OSBU should do $140mn in revenue and $14mn in EBIT.
  Comps NCI, FCN, XPRT, WINS, CRAI trade for about 1.5-2x ev/sls using the low end of this 1.5x times $140mn in OSBU revenue $210-280mn or $10.80-$14 per share. Given the leverage in the very high margin (24%) international business due to the mix of royalties and consulting should make this reasonable.
  CSBU: Retail: valuing the stores at .3x ev/sls or $1.25 a share
Consumer Direct: Internet and Catalog sales valued at 1.25x sls or $3.45 a share
Wholesale: sells to Target, Wal-mart, and Costco, $20mn at .50x sls or .50 a share
  FC  has NOL;s of $58mn of which $30mn can be used or  .50 a share in value
   Sum of parts= $15.70 a share

   c) Hidden Asset 
The hidden asset is a management stock loan program implemented in 2001-2002 with which employees borrowed money to purchase FC shares.  Due to the decrease in stock price since then management has renegotiated the terms of the loan so that the debtors will pay the company either a total of $48mn in cash or 3.6mn shares (the latter option is the most likely, debtors just hand their shares back).  It has been fully written down (FY2004) and the debtors will pay FC by earliest of March 2013 or when the stock price reaches ~$13.  The table below details the EV including this loan program shares redemption and fully diluting options and warrants (avg. exercise price $12.4 and $8 respectively):

  Catalyst: Declining amortization rates.  Every dollar allocated to or freed up from amortization charges drops directly to pre-tax earnings, creating optics of tremendous operating leverage and growth of GAAP results. 
  Specifically, I believe amortization rates are artificially high currently as management is booking purchases at overly conservative assumptions to save on cash taxes paid in 2017 while waiting for clarity on corporate tax reform and/or free cash flow generation to catch up to the improved purchasing environment in the United States.  I expect amortization rates to begin to fall in Q1 2018, or as soon as clarity on tax reform is reached, and to be significantly lower by 2019-2020.  This will create growth in reported GAAP numbers in excess of fundamental cash collection growth. 
  Thesis: PRAA is a cyclical company with complicated accounting currently trading at a no-growth valuation.  The fundamental economic cycle for most of the business bottomed in 2015, but we are being offered the same investment opportunity today.  A combination of government regulation, lag in company results, and conservative management have masked improvements in company results that will result, at some point, in improved reported results and significant growth in EPS.  As a new oligopoly in the US due to CFPB regulation, PRAA stands to benefit from an up cycle in the industry.  No one can predict the specific date when results will improve due the difficulty of forecasting amortization rates, creating opportunity to invest ahead of others if you have a longer time horizon or a trigger if you prefer to wait for a trend to start. 
  Revenue Model/Accounting & Terminology
This is available in filings, but typically generates the most questions, so feel free to skip forward if not needed.  I’d particularly direct your attention to slides 16-17 of the September 2017 investor presentation for more detail. 
  First and foremost:  GAAP accounting obscures the economic underpinnings of the business.  Revenue is a metric of gross profitability for PRAA, materially understating cash generated by the company.  A typical revenue cycle looks like this:
  Purchase charged-off debt and record at purchase price on the balance sheet as Net Finance Receivable (NFR)
Estimate the cash to be collected over an assumed 10-year life.  This is management's primary location to make assumptions on how much will be collected and in what year.  Total dollars collected peak in years 2-3 of collections and trail off much like an oil well decline curve over time.  The sum of all estimated cash collections is Estimated Total Collections (ETC).  ETC / Original purchase price (NFRs) = Purchase Price Multiple. The portion of ETC not yet collected or written off is Estimated Remaining Collections (ERC).  These items are disclosed as supplementary information in 10-K and 10-Q reports on a vintage year basis
Start collections.  Perform an IRR calculation on the NFR purchase price and estimated cash flows from ERC over the remaining life of the debt.  This IRR is the Gross Yield (IRR) of the vintage.  Gross yield and cost to collect are the primary purchasing decisions for management, and I believe 30-40% IRRs are management’s minimum hurdle rate for purchasing of credit card portfolios.  In periods of limited supply (2015) they may reach to 25%. 
Report results via GAAP.  Period-start NFR balance * Gross Yield (IRR) = Revenue recognized for the period.  Note that revenue from existing portfolios is determined at the beginning of the reporting period by the Gross Yield, itself derived from cash collection estimates.  Cash Collections less Revenue = Amortization.  Most amortization is “cash applied to NFR balance” but also includes any Allowances or write-offs of NFRs deemed uncollectable during the period.  Cash Collections less Amortization less Allowances = Revenue reported on GAAP statements
Readjust ERC cash collection assumptions, impacting ETC and Purchase Price Multiple.  Calculate a new Gross Yield (IRR) using the remaining unamortized NFR balance and estimated ERC cash flows.  Rinse and repeat. 
    No-Growth Valuation / Current Situation
Several factors over the last few years have impacted each of the four reported segments of PRAA and left the business with no- or negative-growth rates on all important metrics.  The market has not responded favorably.
  Americas Core – 56% of cash collections FY2016.  Growth in small Brazil & Canada operations has not offset decline of domestic credit card collections.  Tight credit after the financial crisis limited supply of new charged-off debt, hurting PRAA’s profitability.  Low supply and/or high competition lead to higher purchase prices and lower returns.  CFPB regulation/uncertainty further limited supply as 3 major sellers of charged-off debt (Wells Fargo, Chase, Bank of America) suspended debt sales, representing ~30-40% of total annual charged-off credit card debt.  Supply bottomed in 2015 per my calculations.  Large allowances (write-offs) of NFRs were recorded in 2015-2016 for debt that was deemed no longer collectable under new CFPB regulations. Cash collections were (1%) YoY in FY2016
  Americas Insolvency – 17% of cash collections FY2016.  The OCC updated/muddled regulations on the sale of bankruptcy auto loan debt in 2014.  PRAA essentially stopped all bankruptcy purchasing due to low supply/high prices in 2H 2014 resulting from OCC changes through Q1 2017.  In FY2013, this segment represented 41% of total cash collections.  Cash collections were (27%) YoY in FY2016. 
  Europe Core – 26% of cash collections FY2016.  The 2014 purchase of Aktiv Kapital came with known slower portfolio recovery rates than US collections (ie: lower gross yields), and the takeout premium of the purchase lowered the expected return on Aktiv’s sizable existing Europe portfolio.  European pricing environment has worsened since 2014, and collections here have been unable to do more than offset the decline of Americas Insolvency business.  Cash collections grew 14% YoY in FY2016. 
  Europe Insolvency – 1% of cash collections FY2016.  Fast growing but too small to move the needle.  Cash collections were up 99% YoY in FY2016.
  Due to the lack of growth, PRAA trades near its 1.0x EV/Net ERC valuation.  This is not a run-off or liquidation valuation, but is akin to a bank’s 1.0x P/B metric, assuming PRAA is only able to purchase enough new debt to replace the ERC collected each year with no improvement in profitability.  Net ERC is calculated as total ERC less the cash cost to collect on the debt.  I use each quarter’s cash operating costs / cash collections as the cost to collect, but this metric has consistently been near 40% of cash collections historically.  Q2 2017’s data of $5.3b ERC and $1.9b net debt leads to a 1.0x EV/Net ERC stock valuation of $28.77.  This excludes some small lines of business, portfolios not on accrual accounting, investments, and other minor items. 
  Since Q3 2015 when revenue growth first went negative, the playbook has been for a weak earnings report to be sold down to this 1x EV/Net ERC area, from which the stock typically grinds higher into the next earnings report.  While not a “floor” in the stock, this certainly appears to be where the value bid can be found.  Q1 2017 was the first truly good earnings report since 2014, followed up by a clunker in Q2 with disclosures that the market assumed to be a no-growth guide.  (Note: management does not give guidance)
  Long-Run Valuation Model
When results are decent (or mid-cycle), I believe the market primarily values PRAA on a P/E basis due to “too hard” issues, with a historical range of 10x-20x (ttm) depending on current outlook and observed revenue growth. 
  The goal of the following exercise is to give a rough forecast of results in a normalized environment (primarily shown via amortization rate, discussed later).  I believe a full normalization is reasonable to expect by 2019-2020, but to facilitate comparison with published consensus estimates, I am using my 2019 estimates for valuation.  Note this may be optimistic for a full year of normalized results, but the trend should be extraordinarily clear in business results by this time. 
  Run-off of existing portfolio from year-end 2016.  Assume zero new purchases, zero growth in ETC for owned portfolios, ~6% of current ERC being lost to allowances, 40% of cash collections cost to collect (60% cash operating margin), no new borrowing, 4.5% interest cost (~3.8% actual), and 40% tax rate:
  Results:
2019 Estimated Remaining Collections (ERC): $1,813m
2019 Revenue: $472m
2019 Portfolio Amortization Rate: 47%
2019 EPS: $0.61
  Europe continues with no growth and subdued purchasing.  Assume core purchases at a 165% multiple, insolvency purchases at a 130% multiple (2016 actuals), and no future growth in ETC.  That is, ignore all potential for growth in this segment, which implies ~$300m annual core purchases and ~$40m annual insolvency purchases.  FY2016 purchasing was $352m Europe Core and $43m Europe Insolvency. 
  Results:
Assumed Annual Purchasing: ~$340m
2019 Incremental ERC: +$1,301m
2019 Incremental Revenue: +$87m
2019 Portfolio Amortization Rate: 49%
2019 Incremental EPS: +$0.09
  ETC Growth for existing Americas Core portfolio.  Historically, purchase price multiples have expanded over time, especially for credit card portfolios.  This speaks to management’s conservative estimates and their ability to successfully collect on debt.  The 2008 vintage portfolio was booked at 220% purchase price multiple and is currently at 225%, which is by far the worst performing portfolio on ETC growth over time.  Since the 2002 IPO, the average starting multiple in this segment has been 228%, with the average multiple expanding to 297% by year 5 of collections, with further gains through the 10-year estimated life.  Historically, ETCs will grow 5-10% per year for the first 4-5 years of collection, and grow ~2% per year for the remainder of the assumed 10-year life.  See the purchase price multiple supplemental disclosures in 10-K/Qs for trends and more detail.  Note that the 2015 and 2016 CFPB-inspired allowance write-offs removed an estimated $63m and $228m of ERC, respectively, effectively hiding the growth of ETC in remaining “good” debt.  On a 1x EV/Net ERC basis, these allowances removed $1.40 and $5.05 from share valuation, respectively.  I believe the industry is past all CFPB-related allowance charges as formal rules were published in 2016.  The chart below illustrates historical ETC growth for the Americas Core portfolio, by vintage.  Data includes effect of allowance charges (write offs of NFRs) which is visible as downticks in most recent year data for vintages.  
  Assuming: 2015 vintage performs similarly to 2008 vintage with little to no ETC growth.  All other 2010-2014 vintages perform as follows: ETC growth of 8%, 10%, 6%, 4% for years 2-5 of collection, respectively, and 1% growth for years 6-10.  The 2016 vintage performs at 2010-2014 assumptions less 100bps in years 2-5.  No new purchasing.  No modeling of vintages prior to 2010. 
  Results:
10-Year ending purchase price multiples of 223% for 2015 vintage, 260-270% for others
2019 Incremental ERC: +$275m
2019 Incremental Revenue: +$61m
2019 Portfolio Amortization Rate: 46%
2019 Incremental EPS: +$0.47
    Normalization of US Credit Card market purchasing.  Supply of charged-off debt bottomed in 2015.  See chart below, but note various unadjusted data giving longer historical perspective is available on FRED such as https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=fccr.  
American Express and Discover do not sell debt, and Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Chase have remained sidelined since ~2014 due to regulation changes/uncertainty but remain in contact with PRAA per management.  Using FFEIC call reports, American Express and Discover represent 8-10% of the annual supply of charged-off credit card debt, while the sidelined sellers account for roughly 30-35% of the remaining supply of purchasable debt.  Historical expansions of charged-off debt typically last 2-4 years, but we are coming off a prolonged downturn in supply which may result in an abnormal expansion. 
  Assuming: 4% long-run credit card balance growth and a recovery to a long-run 4% charge-off rate of credit card debt by 2019, with current sidelined and non-sellers staying out of the market and maintaining current ‘market share’ of charged-off debt, 2022 estimated US supply will grow ~54% from year-end 2016.  Obviously, there will be cycles above and below the trend rate.  From today, an economic boom is likely to be fueled by growth in consumer credit balances while an economic bust is likely to have negative growth in balances but a significant move higher in charge-off rate.  PRAA supply should benefit from either situation due to the historical lows in 2015 as one of essentially two remaining US operators due to oligopoly situation created by CFPB regulation in 2014-2016. 
  Also assuming PRAA maintains 35% market share of purchasing (2013-2015 actual: 36.8%, 38.2%, 32.6%) and is able to purchase debt at ~$0.08 per dollar of face value (2014 actual, historical lower, 2015 ~$0.105/dollar face), PRAA purchase volume in dollar terms of US credit card debt will grow ~69% by 2022 from 2016 levels.  (Note: charged-off debt is often sold or collected multiple times before reaching PRAA, who does not resell purchased debt.  This can obscure market share calculations and causes results to lag purchasing conditions)
  Furthermore, assuming PRAA can purchase this debt at a 200% purchase price multiple (2012-2016 actual average 209%) and have ETC grow at normal rates to a 280% 10-year exit purchase price multiple (historically conservative, but likely reasonable for increased market share), and a 2% annual allowance rate, I see the following contribution to results:
  Results:
2019 Incremental ERC: +$2,349m
2019 Incremental Revenue: +$452m
2019 Portfolio Amortization Rate: 42%
2019 Incremental EPS: +$2.42
  Resumption of Americas Insolvency debt purchasing.  This segment is primarily domestic auto loans having court-ordered bankruptcy settlements.  Purchase prices and amortization rates are much higher, but courts handle collection and PRAA is essentially required to only file appropriate paperwork for the collections to be passed through to the company.  After years of essentially no purchasing, we have seen this segment return in 2017.  A few ways to quantify: $97m in domestic auto deficiency purchasing YTD 2017 vs $6m and $7m for 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Also, $167m total domestic insolvency purchasing (auto + credit card) YTD 2017 vs $69m full year 2016 and $65m for full year 2015. 
  Market size data is less readily available.  Average auto loans outstanding and growth rate is available here https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=ffOs.  Capital One holds approximately 4.75% of domestic auto loan market, and has historical annual charge-off rates of roughly 1.7% per Bloomberg.  If we assume this rate is indicative of the entire domestic balance of $1.09 trillion outstanding in April 2017, and 20% of that number is subject to bankruptcy proceedings (frankly, a guess), and the average purchase price is approximately $0.30 per dollar of face value (PRAA average, 2012-2014), there is roughly $1.1b (purchase price) of supply available per year.  This is a very rough estimate.
  We don’t know the cost to collect for this debt, but assuming it is 20% of cash collected (half of call center collection cost), a purchase price multiple of 127% (slightly below 2012-2014 average) and ETC growth of a minimal 2% annually in years 2-6 of each vintage, every $100m of insolvency purchasing contributes an incremental $0.04, $0.08, $0.05, $0.03, $0.02 in EPS per year in collection years 1-5, respectively per my estimates. 
  Assuming PRAA can purchase $250m of insolvency debt per year going forward leads to the following results.  (Insolvency purchasing has been as high as 50% of total purchasing in 2012; a similar rate today would be ~$500m/year purchasing)

  Where this is wrong:
Ignores all YTD 2017 actual results.  This is an exercise focused on normalized long-term results. 
My cash collection model is slightly high in first year of vintage collections, but is close to historical reported gross yield behavior
My amortization rates are low in the first 1-2 years of collection vs management history.  This overstates near term results but understates long term results.  The economics over the 10-year life are the key issue, the difference in results being a timing of recognition issue
It remains possible CFPB-inspired industry changes prevent future growth of ETC estimates, at which point my thesis would be broken. 
Europe purchasing may disappoint long-term.  Segment is most likely to be ‘underfunded’ near term during cash crunch situation.  No great loss given my incremental EPS estimates

    Amortization and Catalyst
Let me be perfectly clear: at some point, an investment in PRAA is a question of trusting management: that they’ll buy good debt, estimate conservatively, and raise those estimates in future years, thereby increasing gross yields, and thus create significantly higher growth rates on GAAP numbers. 
  The path to significantly higher EPS is reasonably easy, if beyond the typical sell-side publicized forecast horizon.  The reason everyone struggles to predict when results will turn is the amortization rate of cash collections. To repeat from the accounting section: every dollar charged to or freed from amortization drops directly to pre-tax earnings.  This is the source of ‘operating leverage’ for this company.  Portfolio assumptions evolve over time in an attempt to amortize NFR balance to $0 at the 10-year assumed life.  Low cash collection assumptions, or simply slow (pushed to out year) collection assumptions lower gross yields, resulting in lowered revenue. 
  If revenue is too high (low amortization) we should worry cash collections are underperforming assumptions and watch for future allowance charges.  If revenue is too low (high amortization) management is either paying far too much to purchase debt (bad pricing) or cash collections are outperforming assumptions, resulting in over-amortization of NFR balances, and we should watch for future improvements in gross yield to recognize more revenue. 
  I believe PRAA is currently over-amortizing (estimating collections in such a way to lower gross yields) its US portfolios to: 1) be conservative on estimates; and 2) minimize its tax burden in the short term. Here’s what we know, or management has stated:
  The supply environment is improving, pricing is improving, and regulatory overhangs have cleared. The industry has reset following 7 years of shrinking supply and increased regulation. 
PRAA has settled with IRS (pre-2012 tax dispute), will pay $240m deferred taxes over 4 years (no fees or interest) starting Q2 2017
With the IRS settlement, PRAA has a new tax agreement where taxes paid will mimic GAAP tax expense on the income statement, which ran at 43.7% in Q2. Call it 40% of EBT, starting Q2 2017.
Adjusted Debt/Equity is near 2x (1.93x) which is the level where management is comfortable. The company is not tapped out, but would rather grow without significant additional leverage. PRAA has $500m in untapped debt facility in the US for additional purchasing if needed.  No debt maturities until 2020, average rate ~3.8% with recent issuance. 
It appears that there is a bit of a cash crunch in 2017, where PRAA probably can't buy as much new debt as they’d like from only the cash generated from collections
Management compensation is based on 3-year rolling ROEs and total shareholder return, so they should want to return to growth and buy as much profitable debt as possible.
Management is selectively buying debt because they’re at collector capacity, which one would think would result in purchasing only the best debt available
The company hiring a ton of domestic collectors (400 in Q1 2017, 900+ last 9 months.  Q2 2016 employed 1,804 FTE collectors.  2,294 Q1 2017, Q2 undisclosed)
Management is opening two new call centers to handle additional debt purchasing
  Yet there is a disconnect in results:
Earnings reports continue to disappoint in 2017, described as poor by all accounts
The 2017 Americas Core vintage is booked at a 195% purchase price multiple, the lowest starting multiple (lowest estimated collections per purchase price) ever recorded, despite the improved environment and management actions to ramp the business.
  Is the company broken? Perhaps.  Historically, amortization rates jump the year following allowance charges, reverting in 1-2 years’ time.  See 2009-2013 Americas Core results for example, with 2015-2016 having similarly high allowance charges.  Here it is critical to remember cash collections allocated to amortization are not taxed in GAAP accounting.  My thesis is management has further amplified the conservative nature of their assumptions due to 1) cover provided by 2015-2016 CFPB-inspired allowance charges and 2) a desire to minimize/delay cash taxes due to single-party control of government and the possibility, however small you may judge it to be, of tax reform.  A temporary side benefit regardless of tax reform would be increased tax-free reinvestment of cash collections into new purchasing during 2017.  I believe management has a history of actively minimizing its tax burden.
  Here’s the full portfolio amortization rates, ex-allowances (w/ allowances in parentheses):
FY 2012: 40.9%   (41.6%)
FY 2013: 42.3%   (41.9%)
FY 2014: 41.8%   (41.4%)
FY 2015: 41.9%   (43.8%)
Q1 2016: 43.7%   (46.3%)
Q2 2016: 44.0%   (47.3%)
Q3 2016: 41.9%   (45.5%)
Q4 2016: 44.2%   (62.2%)
FY 2016: 43.5%   (50.1%)
Q1 2017: 48.1%   (48.8%)
Q2 2017: 48.2%   (49.1%)
  Note the large jump in Q1 2017 and how it appears “in line” historically if calculated with allowances included, as it is by default.  If the tax thesis is correct, we should see increased amortization charges in US portfolios and not just from Insolvency or European collections where amortization rates are naturally higher.
  Quarterly amortization rates and charges, by segment.  There is some seasonality, so compare Q1 to Q1:
  Segment: Q1 2016, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q1 2017, Q2 2017
  Americas Core: 37.5%, 36.4%, 33.1%, 33.6%, 42.2%, 40.4%
Americas Core: 82.2m, 77.8m, 69.7m, 64.9m, 95.7m, 87.6m
Note the large jump in amortization in 2017 on essentially similar cash collections ($443m 1H 2017 vs $433m 1H 2016, an increase of ~$24m amortization vs ~$10m collections)
  Americas Insolvency: 53.5%, 58.0%, 60.6%, 65.6%, 62.3%, 67.8%
Americas Insolvency: 36.8m, 39.3m, 36.6m, 34.8m, 31.0m, 36.0m
  Euro Core: 50.4%, 49.8%, 47.9%, 52.2%, 53.0%, 53.3%
Euro Core: 47.5m, 51.2m, 46.0m, 50.8m, 51.9m, 52.8m
  Euro Insolvency: 73.9%, 69.8%, 74.6%, 76.3%, 78.5%, 74.3%
Euro Insolvency: 1.5m, 1.9m, 3.5m, 3.8m, 3.9m, 3.9m
  Dollar figure-wise, we see the biggest jump in the domestic portfolio, which makes sense if the tax thesis is really in play.  The increased purchasing of Americas Insolvency segment has not yet had time to significantly impact collections and amortization rates of the overall portfolio. 
  Furthermore, Encore Capital (ECPG), PRAA’s peer and other half of oligopoly in the US, has reported the following amortization rates (ex-allowances) in its US portfolio:
2012: 42.9%
2013: 43.4%
2014: 41.6%
2015: 40.5%
2016: 39.0%  (Q1-Q4, respectively: 43.3%, 41.4%, 36.1%, 35.1%)
2017 Q1: 41.5%
2017 Q2: 40.0%
  Critically, we don’t see the large jump in domestic amortization rates for ECPG (2016 39% to 2017 ~40.7%) we do with PRAA (2016 35% to 2017 ~41%), indicating that it is unlikely the purchasing environment alone is responsible for PRAA’s estimate changes.  Either PRAA’s debt significantly worsened at fiscal year-end 2016 after all CFPB-impaired debt had been written off, or management’s forecasts became significantly more conservative relative to ECPG’s.  I tend to hold PRAA management in higher regard, so lean toward the latter. 
  My expectation is for PRAA domestic amortization rates to begin declining after clarity is reached on tax reform (regardless of outcome) or starting in Q1 2018 as portfolio performance dictates improved estimates.  Results in the meantime are likely to continue to disappoint in the $0.25 EPS/quarter range, but the 1x EV/Net ERC valuation should limit downside.  I expect full ‘normalization’ of amortization rates in the 2019-2020 timeframe, though the trend should be clear well ahead of normalization.  ECPG’s full portfolio Q2 2017 amortization rate was 41.0% vs PRAA’s 48.2%.  A long-term convergence in the 43% range or lower is reasonable outside of “the industry is broken” scenarios and would be in-line to somewhat-higher compared to historical results. 
  For perspective, my 2019 estimated $3.96 EPS comes with 43.7% amortization rates.  A +/- 500bps change in that amortization rate would raise or lower forecast 2019 EPS by approximately $1.30 on identical cash collections.  The primary questions for investing in PRAA is what your base rate for amortization should be, whether you want to wait to see a trend of declining amortization rates before committing capital, and if the opportunity falls in the 'too-hard' pile.

Catalyst
Declining amortization rates.  Every dollar allocated to or freed up from amortization charges drops directly to pre-tax earnings, creating optics of tremendous operating leverage and growth of GAAP results. 
  Specifically, I believe amortization rates are artificially high currently as management is booking purchases at overly conservative assumptions to save on cash taxes paid in 2017 while waiting for clarity on corporate tax reform and/or free cash flow generation to catch up to the improved purchasing environment in the United States.  I expect amortization rates to begin to fall in Q1 2018, or as soon as clarity on tax reform is reached, and to be significantly lower by 2019-2020.  This will create growth in reported GAAP numbers in excess of fundamental cash collection growth.",26.16487901154219,31.00358328601992,12.078856219751176,-1.9713234572779534,10.002825370980101,2.259908969517113,6.772765164187917,12.665285857641976

This write-up was mostly completed when Barrons wrote a piece this Saturday about the security.  Unfortunately for potential buyers, this has caused a pop (temporary or otherwise) in the security from $8 to $10.  I still think it is value here, though obviously with 25% less upside.  Potential buyers could own some here and increase the position if it fades back to the pre-Barron's attractiveness.

The Bank of America E Pfd, a non-cumulative low-dividend floating rate preferred stock, is a very attractive risk-adjusted reward for US taxpaying investors.  Equating the preferred with debt and solving for the same after-tax yield, the BAC E's 10% yield is the equivalent of 13.1% yield for a corporate bond (assuming dividend tax rate of 15% and interest tax rate of 35%).  The CDS is currently at 125 bps so one is getting paid roughly 8x the credit spread for taking preferred risk vs CDS risk (with some obvious financing differences in funding the cash).  While non-cumulative preferred stock are admittedly a weak structure, the BAC's seem quite attractive relative to other similarly structured preferreds at other large banks (even those with much wider CDS spreads) or the credit of the large banks. 

There is obviously a lot of discussion that can go on here with BAC's balance sheet, how the US governnment will intervene on continued weakening, and the appropriate cost of capital in this market. Nevertheless, considering BAC's senior debt credit spreads and its equity market cap cushion, the attractiveness of the BAC E's  is undeniable relative to other BAC prefs and the pref securities of other large banks.  They have greater upside, greater yield, less downside, and an embedded interest rate option.  

Comps
BAC 125 bps 5 year CDS
  BAC E, L + 35 bps with 4% floor, current yield 10%, trading at 40% of par, non-cumulative
  BAC D, 6.204% coupon, current yield 10.66%, trading at 58% of par, non-cumulative
  BAC U, 5.875% coupon, current yield 9.04%, trading at 65% of par, trust pref structure (may defer cash coupons for 5 years)

C 205 bps 5 year CDS
  C S, 6% coupon, current yield 10.71%, trading at 56% of par, trust pref
  C I, 6.5% coupon, current yield 11.82%, trading at 55% of par, non-cumulative, convertible at $33.73/share

GS 300 bps 5 year CDS
  GS C, L+ 75bps with 4% floor, current yield 7.46%, trading at 54% of par, non-cumulative
 
JPM 125 bps 5 year CDS
  JPM G, 6.37% coupon, current yield 7.57%, trading at 86% of par (cumulative pref, formerly BSC)

MS 410 bps 5 year CDS
  MS A, L + 70 bps with 4% floor, current yield 8.70%, trading at 46% of par, non-cumulative  -- directly comparable to BAC E, trading higher, yielding lower with wider CDS

WFC 125 bps CDS
  GWF, 5.625% coupon, current yield 7.10%, trading at 79% of par, trust pref

The upside is potentially high -- were BAC E's to tighten to similar levels as the JPM or WFC shown here, the security would appreciate from its current price of $10 to $13.5 or so, a return of 35%, prior to considering the interest rate option (worth an additional $1, conservatively).  Were bank preferreds to start trading at double the CDS spread-- which seems justifiable if one assumes that government bailouts would not protect holdco debt holders more than holdco pref holders-- BAC E would trade to $20.  

How much is the interest rate optionality provided by the 4% floor worth?
The BAC E's floor coupon of 4% creates a valuable interest rate option.  One can think of it as a 4% pref security combined with a series of call options on the 3 month libor struck at 4% (these are called caplets by fixed income people).  Interest rate options are extremely expensive in the current environment, as there is much uncertainty about the sustainability of current low rates.  Due to the perpetual term of the security, the imbedded BAC credit risk, and the issuer call, there is some complexity in valuing interest rate optionality.  Without being more precise than my expertise justifies, I'd point out that 3 month libor has averaged about 5.25% over the last 25 years and was 10% in 1989.  So there is real value in the floor coupon optionality, particularly if one believes that Bernanke monetary policy will lead to inflation down the road.  I put the value of the option at greater than $1 per share, but I would encourage any interest rate derivative experts to opine.

Trust Prefs vs Cumulative Straight Prefs vs Non-cumulative Straight Prefs
The preferred market can be broken into three types: trust prefs, cumulative straight prefs, and non-cumulative straight prefs.  Trust prefs are pref shares issued by a trust and backed by subordinated corporate notes.  They are taxed on a look-through basis as notes, so ""dividend"" payments are taxed as interest income.  Trust pref payments are linked to the underlying subordinated notes, which usually have a deferral option that allows the issuer to defer interest payment for up to five years.  Cumulative straight prefs are prefs which accrue dividends for all periods, whether declared or not.  If the Board deems it imprudent to pay the dividend in cash, dividends accrue in arrears.  Non-cumulative straight prefs do not accrue dividends in arrears, so, if the Board chooses not to declare a dividend, that dividend is simply lost forever.  

The trust prefs offer the increased rights of being a look-through creditor-- albeit the most junior creditor imaginable.  The advantage of being a creditor was demonstrated by the UST-led, creditor-backed GSE coup, as value was gifted from preferred and common equity holders to creditors and homeowners without anything resembling a fair process.  Some may speculate that, should the banks ultimately need government aid in excess of what has already been provided, trust prefs may be treated better than straight prefs.

Offsetting the advantages of creditor rights are the substantial tax advantages of owning straight prefs, both as an individual and as a corporation.  Individuals are taxed at the 15% dividend rate and corporations only pay tax on 30% of dividends received.  

There are three reasons to believe that banks will continue to pay pref dividends in all but the worst of instances.  The first, and perhaps least convincing, is that the pref market has been an important source of financing and any issuer failing to pay dividends would shut off the pref market as a source of funding for the foreseeable future (it's worth noting that the pref market seems basically shut to all issuers at the moment).  The second reason is that all the big banks have accepted TARP preferred investments, which are pari passu to existing prefs, meaning that an issuer can't short-change pref holders without short-changing Paulson at the same time.  The final reason is the common dividend, which would have to be eliminated if pref dividends weren't paid in full.  

The non-cumulative pref agreements generally forbid an issuer from declaring cumulative pref dividends without declaring dividends on non-cumulative shares of equal rank.  Allowing cumulative and trust pref dividends to accrue in arrears is a sign of substantial weakness.  Given the leverage of all the big banks, such a situation is likely to either resolve itself quickly (say, with a bailout) or lead to the demise of the institution.  It's important to note that, in the Lehman bankruptcy, trust prefs = cum prefs = non-cum prefs = common shares = 0, which is likely to be the case for any of these extremely leveraged institutions.  

Why low coupons are a good thing
In the pref asset class, a high stated coupon seems to perversely garner a premium yield valuation.  I will leave it to Psychology hobbeyists to speculate why that might be so.  If the market does prefer a high coupon, BAC E's low coupon, a ridiculous L +35bps, makes it vulnerable to cheapening.  However, there are two reasons to prefer a low coupon pref to a high coupon pref of the same yield.  The most important reason is that the low coupon pref is less burdened by the imbedded issuer call.  If credit conditions improve, the upside of high coupon prefs is capped by right of the company to buy back the prefs at par.  After an initial non-call period, virtually all prefs are short this call option. BAC E's terribly low coupon makes the company's call at par (or 250% of current market value) essentially worthless.  The second reason to prefer low coupon prefs over similarly yielding high coupon prefs is that, in event of a dissolution of the company in which prefs do not recovery full liquidation preference, the lower coupon pref will have less downside in all scenerios except one in which all prefs get zero.  This is so because the low coupon pref trades at a lower percentage of its liquidation claim.

 Investment Thesis:
With the divestiture of its HMO operations completed, MDF's cash flow should accelerate in 2009 and profitability will reach record levels.
With a FCF/EV yield of over 35%, a cash adjusted P/E of only about 3.0X 2009 EPS, a EV/EBITDA multiple of only 2.2x, and a relative valuation of less than half its closest comparable, the shares offer an attractive valuation.
The combination of current cash on the balance sheet and the predictable near term cash flows, which represent a 25%-30% discount to a worse case scenario valuation, offers value investors a very healthy margin of safety.
My intrinsic valuation analysis show the company is worth about $3.00-$3.50 per share today (more than double the current stock price) and this figure should grow by an additional $0.25-$0.30 per year based on additional cash flow generation.
Management's has in place an aggressive program underway to repurchase 19% of the shares outstanding, which I view as a strong vote of confidence and will be accretive to EPS by about 20%.
The company recently divested its money losing HMO operations which has improved profitability, cash flow and earnings.
The remaining business operations have delivered healthy returns, with a 20%+ ROIC and strong cash flow dynamics for many years, although masked by the recently divested HMO operations.
A new expanded partnership with Humana provides MDF with a number of incremental growth opportunities and expansion into new Florida counties.
The company is buying additional networks of physicians and service providers to help diversify its financial performance away from risks tied to changes in Medicare Advantage.
A strong balance sheet with about half of its market capitalization in cash and no debt helps support its current share repurchase program and gives management the ability to selectively acquire groups of physicians in its network.
INTRODUCTION: In his 2009 letter to shareholders Warren Buffett stated ""pessimism is your friend, euphoria the enemy"". With that in mind I note that one of the areas of the market that investors have recently shunned is the sector of the healthcare market tied to Medicare. The combination of the rhetoric from the Obama administration to reduce health care spending and to move to a national health care system coupled with the actions by the government to reduce the growth in Medicare payments beginning in 2010 has pressured most stocks in the sector. One of the stocks that has sold off on these concerns is MDF. Thus, I believe it is timely to update my recommendation on the shares, discuss recent changes that enhance the business model and highlight a valuation that even considering a worse case scenario (i.e. the Medicare business completely goes away sometime in the future) is attractive in that the current price represents a discount to cash and predictable near term cash flows with a free call option on the residual business.  
For any VIC member unfamiliar with the company there are a number of past write-ups that I would refer you to regarding background. In short, the company operates a provider service network (PSN) of doctors, hospitals and related professionals that service Medicare members in a growing number of south and mid-Florida counties primarily through a HMO partnership with Humana. Given the nature of the business and the role that MDF takes on as a risk provider, where it receives a fixed payment per Medicare member per month and provides the necessary medical services that these members require, there is some variability in its profitability, especially on a quarterly basis. Notwithstanding this, the company's PSN operations have consistently shown strong profitability on an annual basis since a new management team was brought on during 2003.

AN IMPROVED BUSINESS MODEL & CASH FLOW DYNAMICS: With the appointment of a new CEO in mid 2003 followed by subsequent restructuring moves and the addition of a new senior level management team, MDF was transformed into an increasingly healthy and very profitable company. As a result of a recent corporate restructuring the company's business model has improved with the divesture (sold to Humana) of its money losing efforts to start-up its own HMO. The elimination of the company's HMO operations removes a major issue that has been clouding the shares, depressing profitability and cash flow, and diverting management's time and attention away from its core business. What is remaining at the company now is a healthy and very profitable PSN business. Noteworthy this core PSN business has historically delivered a 20%+ ROIC and excellent cash flow dynamics since 2004 when the new management team came on board. As a result of the divesture of the HMO and the benefits of a more focused management team, my estimates are that the company's profitability and cash flow will accelerate to record levels in 2009. During the current period of significant economic upheaval this financial performance should stand out and will place MDF in an unique position this year. I am modeling cash flow to accelerate to about $13.5M, which represents a FCF/EV yield of over 35%. In the past these cash flows were used to self fund its green fields HMO start-up efforts and are now free to build up, make small selected acquisitions and repurchase shares under an aggressive buy-back program. Note, the March 09 quarter will mark the first totally clean quarter of financial results without the HMO operations. Thus, going forward MDF's financials will show the true underlying health of the company's core PSN business model.
AN EXPANDED PARTNERSHIP, NEW GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES: Historically, while the company's PSN operations have very profitable and delivered strong cash flow, top line growth has been modest. However, due to the expanded relationship the company has structured with Humana as part of the divesture of its HMO operations, there are multiple opportunities for future growth. While the recent changes by the government to moderate the growth in Medicare Advantage reimbursement rates (discussed below) could have some negative impact on the growth in overall Medicare Advantage members, MDF has new growth opportunities tied to: 1) servicing the 7,400 members it sold to Humana, 2) partnering with Humana to expand into new Florida counties together, and 3) benefiting from Humana's aggressive marketing plans to grow its CarePlus operations.
Lately there has been evidence that competitive conditions in the HMO market in Florida, following a period of increased competition by a number of aggressive small and less capitalized players, are starting to reverse and that a significant consolidation is beginning. Noteworthy, a few weaker plans have either shut down, been closed by the government regulators or forced to sell themselves off in the last 18-24 months. In fact these same issues were one reason why the management of MDF made the decision to sell their own HMO to and partner with Humana last year. Given some of the new changes to the Medicare Advantage program (discussed below) which will make it more challenging to grow membership to critical mass for a number of smaller players and the likelihood of some pressures on profitability, some observers believe the pace of consolidation will accelerate. The plans facing the most challenges are those without scale, with weak financial resources and substandard management teams. On the other hand, the winners are likely to be the larger, well managed plans (like Humana) with skilled marketing and financial management teams able to operate more efficiently and wring out every dollar of profit under less plentiful reimbursement programs. Thus, not only did MDF sell off its HMO at the right time, but they appear to have aligned themselves properly with one of the winners during the upcoming consolidation phase.
DIVERSIFICATION EFFORTS REDUCE MAJOR RISK: In an effort to somewhat diversify the company's business and have better control over its network of service providers, MDF has been slowly acquiring various networks of doctors and related health care providers. This physician's network business (PNB) currently accounts for about 24% of revenues and while the company does not break out the profitability of these operations except to say these networks tend to be more profitable than those they contract with, I would suspect that they comprise about 25%-30% of operating profits. I would expect to see the company take advantage of the current environment to use some of its cash to continue acquire additional physician's networks at accretive prices. In addition to the enhanced profitability from these operations, the ownership of a network of doctors and other service providers helps insulate the company from any significant structural changes to the private Medicare Advantage program as the company's costs can be directly reimbursed either directly or through traditional government sponsored Medicare programs..
THE IMPACT OF CHANGES TO MEDICARE: Recently the shares of most HMO's with significant Medicare exposure have come under pressure following news from the government overseeing body CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicare Services) that the all in Medicare Advantage payment rate per member in 2010 would be less than expected. A preliminary announcement in February, followed by the news of the final rate on April 6th showed a increase of only 0.8% (versus a increase of about 3.6% in 2009) and when combined with certain coding adjustments, results in a net decline of about 5% in Medicare Advantage payments to private HMO's. The government's motivation is to reduce what it believes is a premium paid to insure seniors in private plans (Medicare Advantage) versus public Medicare. An advisory panel to Congress reported that Medicare pays the private plans 13% more on average than the cost of care for a traditional Medicare patient. The one thing that is sometimes left out of the political discussion on this subject is that the reason why the private plans receive a higher reimbursement is that on balance they offer greater medical benefits for seniors and by many accounts have a higher success rate in taking care of their members.
What will be the impact of this on MDF? The likelihood is that the reimbursement reductions for 2010 will result in some changes to private Medicare Advantage plans. Most of the HMO's are crunching the numbers now and will file their plans for 2010 by the mid-June deadline. The likelihood is that all of the parties - the HMO's, medical service providers (like MDF) and enrollees - will have to make some sacrifices. Most plan operators will likely scale back the services that they offer commensurate with the payments received. The most likely areas that will be affected will be such auxiliary services as dental, eye and hearing plans. Also, drug plans will likely be more restrictive to cover only a limited set of essential generic drugs. I suspect the HMO's will be careful not to make the cuts too severe as that could make them less attractive relative to direct pay government Medicare and slow the growth in members. Even considering offering slimmer benefits, some independent observers believe Medicare Advantage plans will still provide a better value proposition to seniors than they would receive under traditional Medicare. Thus, membership may still expand during the period when these changes are implemented, albeit it at a slower rate. In addition, as discussed previously industry consolidation will likely create an opportunity for the stronger players (like Humana) to take market share and increase membership. Members in these plans will likely also see an increase in their monthly premiums or co-pays. Medical service providers like MDF will also have to share in some way with the fact that there will be less profit in the equation to be shared under existing agreements. Thus, their revenue share per member will likely be negatively affected which will impact revenue and profits. However, in the case of MDF this could be somewhat offset by the combination of incremental growth opportunities and better financial management (i.e. improved risk scoring). As a result, my model forecasts these factors will net out to a reduction in MDF's profitability and cash flow in 2010 of about 10%-15% from the record profitability that I expect in 2009.
Longer term the concern among investors appears to be that the current Obama administration will enact legislation centering on some type of national health care plan that would in effect end private Medicare. While this topic is debatable, most independent observers suggest that such an extreme move would be tantamount to political suicide and would likely take many years at best to enact. Noteworthy, Medicare Advantage plans now provide health benefits to about 10.7 million seniors or about 24% of the 44 million participants in the government health insurance program for the elderly and disabled. Given the inertia and acceptance of these plans from private providers (like Humana) any move to do away with them would likely be met with significant voter outrage. Thus, while changes enacted on the margin by elected officials may slow the growth and/or reduce the profitability of these plans, it is highly unlikely that they will be shut down (i.e. the worst case scenario).
AN ATTRACTIVE VALUATION WITH A NICE MARGIN OF SAFETY: The current market price suggests that investors have already adopted a dire view for the outlook for both Medicare Advantage in general and MDF in particular. I would submit that at current prices the market is already discounting a worst case scenario for MDF and has not properly valued the company based upon the current cash on its balance sheet and the predictable future cash flows in the PSN (excluding the money losing HMO operations) and physician's network businesses. As illustrated below, taking the company's cash position and adjusting for cash flow variables in the current year, as well as the next two years (the earliest time any dire changes in Medicare Advantage could be enacted) shows a cash value above the current stock price. In addition, investors are receiving a free call option on the value of the company's physician's network businesses, which if valued at 8-10x cash flow yields an additional $0.50-$0.75 per share in value. Thus, adding all the pieces of my analysis together looking 24 months out yields worse case value of about $2.09-$2.34 per share, or a 35%-50% premium to the current share price.

    On the other hand, valuing the company's cash flow at a 8-10x multiple and adding back in the current cash and temporary account receivable due from Humana, shows the intrinsic value of the company to be about $3.00-$3.50 per share today. This represents significant upside potential in the share price and will grow by about $0.24-$0.27 on an annual basis from future operating cash flows. Note, my analysis does not assume any future growth associated with the company's joint initiatives with Humana. This analysis is as follows:

Finding comparable public companies to look at relative valuations is not easy. The traditional HMO's are much larger in size and have a somewhat different business model. However one publicly traded company, Continucare (CNU), is similar in nature in that it provides health services in the South Florida market to a number of HMO's and is about similar in size to MDF. However, relative to valuations, the similarities end right there. For example, based on consensus estimates, the shares of CNU sell at a cash adjusted P/E of about 8.6x fiscal 2009 earnings versus a cash adjusted P/E for MDF of only 3.0x my estimate of $0.24 per share. Moreover, looking at a relative comparison of trailing twelve month EV/EBITDA multiples, CNU sells at a valuation of about 4.5x, while MDF's PSN operations (excluding the divested HMO operations) is valued at only a EV/EBITDA multiple of only 2.2x. I submit that what is responsible for this difference and the low relative valuation accorded the shares in general is the past operating losses from the HMO. I believe that as investors begin to see the real underlying earnings and cash flow of the new company (excluding the HMO operations) this relative valuation disparity will begin to narrow in the near future, which will begin to be evident with the March quarter results.
 SHARE BUY-BACK IS A STRONG VOTE OF CONFIDENCE: In October of last year the company announced a 10 million share repurchase program, which represented a healthy 19% of the outstanding stock. I view this move as a strong vote of confidence by management regarding both the future fundamental outlook as well as a comment on the valuation of the shares. Noteworthy, management announced this plan when the share price was about $2.00 per share. At current prices, I believe that management has every intention of repurchasing all the shares allocated under the plan. At the end of the December quarter the company had bought back almost 4.1 million shares under the program at an average price of about $1.82 per share. My calculations show that at current prices, repurchasing the remaining shares would be accretive to EPS by about 20% on an annual basis.
 Risks:
Given the nature of the company's business where it receives a fixed reimbursement for each member and provides the required medical services, its quarterly profitability can be impacted by periods of heavy medical utilization, especially during the winter cough & cold season. Given the data suggesting that the cough & cold season in Q1 in Florida was higher than normal this could negatively impact results, but I expect management's commentary on its business to be very upbeat.
Annual changes by the government (via CMS) to the Medicare reimbursements require adjustments to the services offered under individual plans (i.e. by Humana), which could impact membership levels and profit margins.
An increase in competitive conditions or a move to fee based Medicare plans could impact membership levels and profitability.
Given the partnership the company has with Humana, an inability of MDF to provide adequate services to its members could negatively impact its future relationship.
Catalyst
Beginning with the Q1 (March) results the real underlying earnings and cash flow strength of the company (excluding the recently divested HMO) will be evident.

2001-03-23,solasis11,THO,Thor Industries,https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/Thor_Industries/8726107465,0.0,22.0,"Description
Thor Industries is a small cap cyclical with no long term debt and current ratio of 3:1 selling at a 30% premium to equity, less than 8 times peak earnings (CY2000) and 6.5 times cash flow.

From Valueline: ""Thor Industries is the successor to a company of the same name that was formed in July 1980 to acquire the Airstream Division of Beatrice. Airstream was founded in 1931. Thor completed an IPO in 1984 and moved to the NYSE in 1986. Thor manufactures a wide range of buses, mobile homes and travel trailers. It is second in it's industry in RV's, first in travel trailers, and first in North America in the small and mid-sized bus category.""

I know at this point you're thinking oh great, another crappy RV manufacturer in a cyclical trough. However, the key to this story is threefold. First, they have no debt while many of their competitors are loaded with debt. Second, the key driver of this business is now buses and not RV's or trailers. Third, they have earned higher returns on capital than their competition throughout the entire economic expansion. They are still cash flow positive (unlike FLE for example) and are expanding bus manufacturing capacity this year as demand in that side of the business continues to grow. Capital for expansion is being funded internally through cash flow. Their order backlog for buses is up 46% in the past year.

Market cap less than 280 million. About 3500 employees. 11.99M shares out, a float of 4.7M. Officers and directors own 46% of the outstanding shares. So I think it's safe to say that management ""eats it's own cooking"". No long term debt, current ratio 3:1, shareholder equity 207M. last year's cash flow 40.8M, net income 36.1M on sales of 894M. Around 139M in working capital with about 52M in cash. No losses on the income statement the past 11 years (cash flow positive throughout the 1990-92 recession). Shareholder equity has compounded 14.5% per year the past 10 years while the depreciation rate has been 9.8%.
This business is either number 1 or number 2 in north american market share in all of its business lines. Overall sales are expected to decline this year by about 10%. Bus sales will probably be up again this year as Thor continues to develop new bus lines. They were a pioneer in the development of propane engines for buses and are now in a pilot program to develop a small sized bus that runs on fuel cells.

The bus manufacturing side is clearly headed towards becoming the key sales line for the business and I do not believe that this is reflected in THO's market cap. In addition, this company deserves a premium to it's industry because of it's stellar balance sheet and higher historical returns on capital.

What is wrong: capital intensive business, management recently backed off a planned hostile takeover of a competitor, management could dissipate the finanical strength of the company with ill timed acquisitions, business may crater, plants are unionized, RV industry is characterized by overcapacity. Higher oil prices could sink the RV industry, but is likely to improve demand for bus transportation at the municipal level, where the company is strongly positioned.

Overview
The Buckle, Inc. is a retailer of casual apparel, footwear and accessories for young men and women. Most of its stores are based in regional malls. As of April 10th, the company operated 309 stores in 37 states compared with 298 stores in 37 states at this same time a year ago.

While the brands offered by the Company change to meet current customer preferences, the Company currently offers brands such as Lucky Brand Dungarees, Silver, Fossil, Billabong, Ecko, Quicksilver, and Roxy. Top categories include denims (33% of fiscal 2002 sales), tops (32%), footwear (11%), and accessories (11%). About 10% of sales are private label merchandise.

Sluggish Results The Past Few Years
The Buckle has experienced weak results since 1999. That year suffered from difficult comps. In 2000, the company suffered with all teen retailers. In 2001 and 2002, the company suffered from a lack of trends, lower price points, and a decreasing percentage of sales from higher-margin footwear. These trends have led to gross margins falling to 32.8% in 2002 from 35.2% in 1999.

Although the company tends to be trend-right, it is subject fashion vagaries of teen apparel retailing. When fashion trends are strong (e.g. 1998-1999), the company will show extraordinary results. On the other hand, results can be weak when trends decelerate or the company faces tough comps (e.g. 2000-2002).

The adverse trends can be seen in comp results over the past few years:

1999 2000 2001 2002
Q1: 10.2% -9.8% -8.7% -1.3%
Q2: 0.9% -11.1% -11.1% 1.3%
Q3: 1.5% -2.7% -3.9% -0.5%
Q4: -3.3% -1.9% -2.1% -1.3%

But Recent Stabilization...
I think an important point to note is that 2002’s results were fairly strong relative to the rest of the market. While comps were slightly negative, they didn’t experience the notable drop of many other teen retailers.

From a more recent perspective, the company had positive 0.5% comps for the four-week period ending March 2, 2003. Comps were down 3.1% during the five weeks ended April 6 (this probably reflects the fact that Easter fell much later this year).

...And a New Store Design Could Help Results
The company is in the midst of rolling out a new store design. In the summer of 2002, the company introduced a revamped store prototype with new architectural finishes, lighting, column treatments, cashwrap design and other stores features. A total of 15 locations (8 new, 7 remodels) were open at the end of fiscal 2002 (January 2003). Management states that these changes were “very positively received” by guests and management and will be incorporated in all new stores and remodels. (The last store update was in 1997.) The company currently plans to open 15 new stores and complete 15 complete remodels this fiscal year. New stores cost about $540K in construction costs and a net $170K to stock inventory. Construction costs on remodeled stores are about the same as a new store. Given the company’s historical judicial use of capital, I assume the sales results from remodel stores justify this large expenditure.

Nice Long-Term Earnings and Profitabity
The company has an enviable track record, with strong earnings growth. Despite sluggish results for the past few years, Buckle has grown its earnings from $0.38/share in 1992 to $1.47 in fiscal 2002. Increased competition and no hot trend has resulted in the stagnant earnings since 1998. Current estimates call for earnings of $1.54 in fiscal 2003.

Despite sluggish earnings growth and very weak comparable store sales in the recent past, profitability has remained excellent. Return on equity has ranged from 12%-23% since the company came public in 1992. As the company slowed growth over the past few years, the returns have dropped to the lower-end of that level. Currently, the figure is about 12%.

Superb Cash Flow and Balance Sheet
While earnings have not grown recently, company generates significant cash flow. Free cash flow has totaled about $30MM per year during 2000 and 2001. That number fell to $20MM in 2002 as the company spends more on CAPX, primarily related to full remodels.

The balance sheet is rock solid. The company has no debt and $162 million in cash ($7.50/share) on its balance sheet as of 02/01/03.

Huge Insider Ownership and Stock Repo Program
Insider ownership is 67% and management is stable. The founder’s son (company was founded in 1948), Daniel Hirshfield, is Chairman. The president and CEO, Dennis Nelson, has been with the company since 1970. Limited liquidity could partially explain Buckle’s lower valuation relative to peers such as Abercrombie, American Eagle, and Pacific Sunwear.

The company has a stock repurchase program, with 500K shares authorized on December 27th, 2000. In 2002, the company acquired 119,125 shares at an average price of $16.64. The company has continued to repurchase shares – with 23,600 shares acquired in March at $16.85

Attractive Valuation
Buckle’s stock is now trading at about 11.6x earnings and is even cheaper when stock price and earnings adjusted for cash. The stock is at the lower end of its P/E range, which has been 7x-20x over the past four years. Using interest-adjusted earnings/enterprise value, BKE is trading at about 7.4x earnings ($10.35 Enterprise Value on $1.40 earnings [1.54 estimate-0.14 tax adjusted other income]).

Summary
Buckle has a solid history, great balance sheet, and extremely cheap valuation. Buckle has a history of very profitably weathering the vagaries of teen fashion. While a catalyst isn’t necessarily immanent, relatively stabilized comps in a generally tough retail environment bode well. The possibility for further improvement from remodeled stores also exists. The biggest risk would be a slowing economy crimping sales or a fashion shift away from denim, which could hurt sales results. That being said, the attractive valuation and continued stock repurchases should put a floor on the stock not too far from the current price.

While today’s valuation hasn’t dropped to lows reached in 2000, the balance sheet is much stronger with $162MM in cash vs. $103MM two years ago. (The company also seems to have much less likelihood of seeing double-digit negative comps than it had during that time period). With fairly limited earnings risk, a strong balance sheet, and the possibility of a rebound with improved consumer spending, better results from remodeling efforts, or a new fashion trend among teens, Buckle appears to be an attractive opportunity.

  Dolphin Capital (DCI) is an interesting deep value opportunity.  DCI is an AIM traded real estate vehicle managed externally by Dolphin Capital Partners.  The company is a developer of high end residential resorts.  Approximately 43% of their portfolio is in Greece, 32.4% in Cyprus, 7.4% in Croatia/Turkey, and 17% in the Americas.  DCI partners with high-end prestige partners including (i.e., Aman Resorts, Ritz Carlton, Oberoi, Jumeriah, etc…) to create luxury residential resort locations.  
DCI is externally managed by Dolphin Capital Partners which is entitled to a 2% management fee on equity and a 20% incentive fee with certain hurdle rate provisos.  The managing partners of Dolphin Capital Partners came out of Soros Real Estate Partners. 
DCI stock trades at 60% of stated NAV and around 30% of a DCF on the company’s projected development pipeline.  They are conservatively capitalized with the balance sheet strength to withstand market disruptions and the cash flow to support development capex without requiring further equity raises.  Finally, investors can take some comfort that the concentrated active involvement of Third Point should keep management’s feet to the fire of shareholder value creation. 
The Balance Sheet:
A key part of the Dolphin story is their solid capital structure. 
Dolphin has total borrowings of EUR 173MM   Of this debt, EUR 50MM and USD 9.2MM are convertible bonds issued at the company level.  The parent company has also guaranteed an additional USD 50MM of property level obligations. 
Against this debt, Dolphin holds real estate assets with a stated NAV of EUR 600MM, EUR 202MM of equity investments (including a 49.8% stake in a Cypriot builder and a 25% stake in the Nikki Beach project), and EUR 43MM in cash.  Net of EUR 32MM in minority interests this is over EUR 800MM in asset value.  A current debt to asset ratio of 21% with the bulk of that debt segregated at the non-recourse project level is a conservative capitalization.
Dolphin has significant ability to pace its incremental project capex to the level of market demand for properties. The protective nature of this is very important.  If market conditions significantly deteriorate, DCI shouldn't find itself overlevered with half completed mega-projects.  Rather, they will be able to slow the incremental buildout of their residential properties and wait out a storm.  If property markets show weakness or Greece/Cyprus undergo another period of turmoil then cash flows may be delayed but the company can wait out the storm. 
The company believes it has the ability to fund the full development of its existing property portfolio from operating cash flows.  Today's considerable discount to NAV shouldn't be whittled away by diluted equity raises.
Discount to NAV:
DCI has a stated NAV of EUR 522MM or GBp 68/share.  Property level asset values are provided quarterly by American Appraisal and Colliers, and audited by KPMG.  It is worth noting that there are several elements which could render this NAV estimate conservative.  First, property sales at DCI to date have exceeded stated NAV estimates.  Second, NAV appraisals largely ignore the value generated by progress along the permitting process from raw unpermitted land to a developable project.  NAVs have already been marked down considerably over the past four years to reflect economic conditions in Greece and Cyprus.
DCI provides an estimated cash-generation estimate for their portfolio. The company believes that its four advanced projects will generate EUR 390MM of net cash returns over the next six years and an additional EUR 831MM in the following six years (2019-2025).  Other major projects are expected to generate EUR 1.3B in the 2013-2025 time period.  Residual land interests with an indefinite time horizon for development are estimated to hold a EUR 1.16B net cash generation potential.  Finally, DCI attributes a 276MM value to their Aristo stake based on a normalized EUR 15MM dividend beginning 2015  with an 8x annual dividend terminal value.  Altogether this leads to a total of EUR 3.958 portfolio cash potential.
While such long term estimates must be taken with a grain of salt, they do indicate the potential for upside optionality in DCI.  Modeling these cash flows with what I believe are a conservative estimates of timing, a 15% discount rate, and manager fees, I get DCF per share in the 100-150 GBp range.  This assumes no inflation on the underlying real estate assets during the next twelve years or attractive reinvestment potential.  The point here is not to place a precise DCF value on such a long-term uncertain cash stream, but rather to illustrate the significant optionality which exists in DCI versus a stock price around 40 GBp.
Quality Co-Investors: 
While it can be dangerous to rely upon the intellect and reputations of other holders, it can be helpful to benefit from the shareholder oversight provided by large concentrated peers.  Major notable investors of note in DCI include Third Point LLC, Fortress, Fir Tree, and SC Fundamental.  Management is also a 13.5% owner of DCI via Dolphin Capital Partners.
Third Point owns 20.2% of the shares in DCI which it purchased via a capital raise in October 2012.  It also owns a significant amount of the company’s convertible debt which it backstopped alongside Monarch Capital.  Third Point appointed David Heller to the board of Dolphin.  Heller, a former Goldman Sachs management committee member and co-head of Global Securities, is a highly respected individual.  Third Point’s extensive involvement alongside several other concentrated holders not known for a reticence to assert themselves provides some comfort that this entity will be managed to maximize shareholder value.
Investment Summary: 
Dolphin is a compelling value investment with several attractive characteristics. The stock trades at an attractive discount to appraised NAV with upside optionality in the 3X range if management’s view of long-term cash flows are in the range of reality.  The company has a conservative capitalization and attractive cash flow characteristics, which limit the risk that the path to ultimate value will be cut short by an intermediate period of adverse conditions.  Finally, investors can benefit from the oversight provided by active concentrated shareholders.
There are of course risks.  I certainly cannot assert say Greece and Cyprus are out of the woods re: macro risks.  That said, DCI performed far better than one might have thought through the Cyrpus banking crisis earlier this year.   DCI benefits from programs in Greece and Cyprus which grant EU citizenship to anyone purchasing property above EUR 250-300K.  A healthy global market exists in regions such as China for wealthy individuals looking to “diversify” their citizenship exposure.  Macro volatility can also be a source of opportunity as DCI is well positioned as a buyer of distressed real estate assets. 
DCI is a long-term asset value story and those who need financial models with multiple decimal points of quarterly precision can move onwards.  This a a long term development pipeline and a lot can happen over 12-15 years.  While the company has a sufficiently conservative structure to wait out significant periods of turmoil, the delay of cash flows obviously would impact the stock's present fair value.  If there was a clean and obvious catalyst then it is unlikely the stock would trade at thee levels.
However, with its steep discount to NAV, powerful upside optionality, and the ability to weather a potentially stormy path to realization, investors at this price seem very well compensated for these risks.
         I do not hold a position of employment, directorship, or consultancy with the issuer.
I and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.
Catalyst
This is a long term asset value play.  With a steep discount to asset value and active, concentrated investors, the potential certainly exists for some kind of asset/company sale accelerating a realization of value.  But, investors here should place this in their patient, long term bucket and treat any accelerating catalysts as a ninth night of Hannukah.",1.8298965623311014,1.104031583941441,-4.568307615841673,-10.233546120305377,3.804533862754483,7.902145291058214,14.573894029951195,16.65754814293642

Lumina Gold: A Rare Opportunity in a Fully Valued Gold Market?

Introduction
  In a world of $1,900 gold, it is becoming difficult to find opportunities that are not fully valued on a reasonable long-term gold price assumption. Investors who were not positioned for the move in gold are left with the unenviable decision of buying into fully valued companies, in hopes of further gold price appreciation, and thus making a directional bet on the price action of gold, or investing in junior miners.
  Juniors can be excellent investments, but they are challenging and require domain-specific due diligence. For those not capable of such work, we have a suggestion: a gold firm that, although a junior, does not have many of the same due diligence challenges of a junior, has an excellent management team, and a built-in catalyst for appreciation in the form of management’s desire to sell.
  Lumina Gold Corporation, a Canadian listed junior, is an explorer and developer, not a builder and operator. The firm's goal is to find assets and de-risk them until they are confident that they can sell them. With this strategy, the Lumina team, through seven different entities, has raised a combined $274 million in equity since the early 2000s and generated $1.6 billion in value through asset sales. In its eighth iteration, the Lumina team is set to do it again in Ecuador, where they have discovered and de-risked a 10.4-million- ounce gold deposit.
  What's Going on Here?
  Lumina Gold Corporation is a Ross Beatty-backed prospect generator that owns the Cangrejos gold deposit in Ecuador. The Cangrejos deposit is the world's 37th largest primary gold asset by resource and the 14th largest undeveloped primary gold deposit by production capacity. It has a measured and indicated resource of 10.4 million ounces of gold and 1.4 billion pounds of copper at a grade of 0.73 grams per ton of gold or a 0.50% copper equivalent grade. The management team has recently completed a preliminary economic assessment (PEA) on the asset, in preparation for a sale, which proposes a bulk tonnage open-pit mine with expected capital expenditure requirements of roughly $1.0 billion.
  The PEA envisions a 25-year mine life, with an average annual production of 366 thousand ounces of gold per year at an all-in-sustaining-cost of $604 per ounce, net of copper byproduct credits. At a long-term gold price of $1,500 and a long-term copper price of $3.00, assuming a 10% discount rate, the value of the asset developed as per the PEA is worth $2.27 (2.99 CAD) per share, producing an expected return from the current price of roughly 200%. If this were a development project with a management team looking to build the mine , we would likely look for a more significant return.

  There are several reasons why we would look for a higher return in the case of development. First, although Ecuador is an increasingly popular destination for mining firms looking to conduct greenfield expansion, it is not without its risks. Second, as a low-grade bulk tonnage asset, minority equity investors may experience significant equity dilution or balance sheet erosion due to mine development costs, not to mention a minimum build time of three years following at least one more year of development drilling and project planning. Luckily, management is focused on selling the asset and, importantly, focused on selling the asset within the next twelve to twenty-four months.
  Going-Concern vs. Resource Conversion
  From our perspective, valuation always starts with the balance sheet. Does the company have a balance sheet and a business model that supports value creation via the flow of cash through the operations, or does the firm have a balance sheet that is asset rich and supports value creation via the conversion of assets into cash via a sale? In short, should the business be valued as a flow or a stock?
  Given the prospect generator model, in which a management team rich in exploration and development expertise finds, de-risks, and sells an asset to someone interested in becoming a producer, Lumina Gold is a resource conversion play. This is important to recognize as it focuses our attention on the essential questions: will it get sold, what is the downside in a sale, and what is the potential upside?
  What is the Downside in a Sale?
  We first must ask; will this asset be developed into a mine? To answer this question, it is helpful to compare the asset to other recently developed assets.
  For those concerned about the grade, which is admittedly low, but not dramatically low, at 0.73 g/t or 0.50% Cu Eq, we would point to three other recently developed low-grade bulk tonnage South American mines that have been developed:
  1) Cobre de Panama: 0.43% Cu Eq
2) Mount Milligan: 0.39% Cu Eq
3) Red Chris: 0.55% Cu Eq
  The fact that other similar or lower-grade comparable projects have been developed in recent years is by no means evidence that the asset will be developed. Still, it is supportive of our contention that, at the very least, the asset is potentially attractive to would-be producers.
  A second question to ask is whether the potential Capex of ~ $1 billion makes this project a non-starter?

Comparables again, in this case, both in Ecuador, can help assuage concerns:
  1) Fruta del Norte: Completed in 2019 at the cost of $700 million
2) Mirador: Completed in 2019 at the cost of more than $1 billion.
  At worst, Cangrejos is an attractive target for potential development; more likely, it is a mine in waiting. Next, we turn to what the value of the asset is in its undeveloped state. Here we have a useful comparison to help us put a lower bound on the value in Lundin Gold's Fruta del Norte mine.
  Fruta del Norte is a sizeable high-grade gold deposit in Ecuador acquired by the Lundin family in 2014. The asset has different operational characteristics then Cangrejos (14 mine life years, reserves of 5.02 million ounces grading 8.74 grams per tonne, and a resource at the time of purchase of 25 million ounces), but
both projects have a similar all-in-sustaining-cost: $621 per oz vs. $604 per oz and initial build costs that are of a similar scale, ~$700 million vs. $1.0 billion. Despite some differences, the circumstances around its acquisitions by the Lundin family make it an interesting comparison.
  The Fruta Del Norte deposit has a long history. Gold mining in and around the deposit dates to the Spanish conquistadors with evidence of both hard rock and alluvial deposit mining starting in the 1500s. The deposit in its current iteration began to take shape when it was being explored and developed by Aurelian
Resources between 2003 and 2008. Aurelian sold the asset to Kinross in 2008 for $1.2 billion (additional assets were included in the acquisition, but the Fruta Del Norte asset was the primary asset acquired).

At the time of the purchase, the asset had a 13 million ounce resource, comparable in size to Cangrejos. Everything went wrong immediately following the acquisition, resulting in Kinross eventually writing down the value of the investment by $720 million in 2013.
  Kinross had made a calculated bet when it acquired Aurelian because the Ecuador government had suspended mining projects across the country while it rewrote the country’s mining legislation. Kinross figured they could navigate those waters. It turned out they were not up to the challenge, and the Ecuadorian government imposed a 70% windfall profits tax on all mining projects. Kinross worked with the government for two years, trying to negotiate a rewrite of the mining code, or at the very least, a more appealing tax regime. Kinross eventually succeeded in negotiating a deal that was more acceptable to the firm's management, but it still included the 70% windfall profits tax, which was not appealing to shareholders. Kinross CEO Tye Burt lost his job, and the new CEO wanted nothing to do with the disaster, selling it in 2014 to Fortess, soon to be renamed Lundin Gold, for $240 million in cash and stock.
  Lundin Gold paid $240 million for a mothballed Ecuadorian gold project that a large, sophisticated mining firm had failed to develop due to political risk. Fast forward to the present, the political situation is entirely different, with dozens of western mining firms crawling over every inch of Ecuador in search of copper and gold deposits. As previously noted, Fruta Del Norte and Cangrejos are different assets. One is a high-grade underground deposit, the other a low-grade open pit deposit, and Fruta Del Norte had a larger resource at the time of the Lundin acquisition. Still, Cangrejos does not have the same troubled political history.
  At the time of the Lundin acquisition, according to the first 43-101 filed by Lundin Gold on the Fruta Del Norte asset, the deposit had an indicated mineral resource of 7.26 million ounces of gold and 9.73 million ounces of silver.
  At the current time, Cangrejos has 10.4 million indicated ounces of gold and 1.4 billion pounds of copper. On a gold equivalent basis, Fruta Del Norte had an indicated resource of 7.4 million ounces at average gold and silver prices during 2014, implying that the Lundin's paid roughly $32 per ounce of political troubled gold in the ground. Cangrejos has approximately 12.6 million gold equivalent ounces in the ground. At $32 per ounce in the ground, this implies that Cangrejos is worth $402 million under circumstances like those in which the Lundin's purchased Fruta del Norte or roughly 63% more than Lumina's current market cap. The political situation is entirely different though.
  Comparable low-grade bulk tonnage mines in South America have been built recently, comparable assets have been developed in Ecuador recently, and troubled but comparable assets in Ecuador have been sold for more than the firm is worth recently. The downside price risk for this investment appears to be roughly the firm's current market capitalization, which is about what Lundin Gold purchased Fruta del Norte for under a political cloud and when the gold price was approximately 33% lower. The idea that the worst you can do allocating capital to Lumina Gold is to receive your invested capital back within 24 months appears reasonable and well supported.
  What is the Upside in a Sale?
  Determining the upside of an investment in Lumina at the current time is more complicated than thinking through the downside. Sensitivities above suggest the NAV per share of the asset is between $1.70 and $2.27. Should you be inclined to discount the cash flows at 5%, which is typical for feasibility studies, while still assuming a long-term gold price of $1,500, the NAV per share is closer to $5.87. Given the history of gold miners and troubled acquisitions at times of high gold prices, we feel comfortable asserting that this investment has a ceiling in a sale of $1.51 (2.00 CAD) per share or roughly a double from here. Although higher valuations fall within our expected NAV ranges, it seems unlikely that a publicly-traded gold miner, other than perhaps a few Chinese firms, will open themselves up to the shareholder ridicule that comes with paying a ~100% premium to the current market value of a single asset. A more reasonable premium to the current market price would be 30% to 50%, a still healthy return in twelve to twenty-four months.
  Simultaneously, we can comfortably assert that management will seek the best offer possible, which, given the downside discussion above, is around the current market cap. We can approach a theoretical valuation in a sale from another direction. Over the last ten years, gold mine mergers have closed at a price of roughly $202 per ounce of reserves, and in 2019 firms paid approximately $191 per ounce of reserves.

At the moment, Lumina does not have any reserves, only resources. If we assume that only 25% of the gold resource converts to reserves, a conservative and risk-averse assumption, the value of the asset in a sale is between $435 million and $460 million, an expected return of between 76% and 86%. This outcome is still high in our opinion but provides further evidence supporting a significantly higher price in sale for Lumina than the market is currently awarding the firm.
  With a firm looking to sell itself, we are not only concerned with the sale price. We are also concerned with the timeline. Just as the downside in valuation appears limited, the downside with timing may also be limited. In January, Ross Beaty, the Chairman of the Board of Lumina, said at the Vancouver Resource Investment Conference that 2020 was the year the firm was going to sell the asset. In a subsequent conversation with management, we have been told that they have a slate of interested parties they are currently talking with that are capable of closing the deal this year. Given all that has happened in the world since January, extending this timeline by a year may be more realistic. Having potential buyers assessing the asset is no guarantee of a sale, but it is a favorable situation for investors.
  Appendix: Political Risk
  Note: Readers interested in learning more about how we approach political risk are encouraged to visit the thought leadership section of our website or download our white paper: ""How to Think About Political & Social Risk in Equity Investing.""
  Political risk is an issue that all investors should think about. Political risk is of particular importance in countries with a history of creating political risk issues for investors like Ecuador. As a reminder to readers who may have read our white paper on the topic, and as an introduction to some of the ideas discussed in that paper to those who have not, we view political risk through the following framework:
  • Political/social risk is idiosyncratic to a business model, its operations, and how a company engages with its operating environment.
• An investor's goal in assessing political/social risk is not to forecast events that may occur but rather to achieve a high conviction that management can deal with political/social events when they do occur.
• Political/social risks are hard to understand because they are people risks. As such, risk management by a corporation is about managing an ongoing bargaining relationship between the company and stakeholders.
• Political mastery by management can be a source of competitive advantage.
  To this list, we add a definition of political risk: Political risk is the probability that political/social events could significantly affect a company's business over a defined period. To expand the utility of the definition, there are a few specific variables to help us understand and think through how that definition applies to a particular asset: likelihood, magnitude, timing and the nature of a potential event. There is little in the way of surety or conviction that an equity investor can generate around the occurrence of events. So some may find the definition presented above problematic. That concern should be put to the side though. As equity investors, our goal is not to calculate the probability of an event but rather to generate high conviction that a company's management team can deal with political/social events when they occur.
  In the case of Lumina, we are principally concerned with the potential occurrence of the following three events:
  1) Regulatory Change
2) Confiscation of Assets
3) Local Social Unrest

For a full discussion of these risks see table below
  All the above risks to Lumina investors are limited in part due to the time associated with a potential sale of the asset. Furthermore, the management team and the firm's largest owner, Ross Beaty, have extensive experience operating in South America. Mr. Beaty has demonstrated himself countless times to be an executive with the ability to navigate tricky operating environments and has, throughout his career, worked hard to maintain good working relationships with local and national governments. The recent purchase of Tahoe Silver by Pan American Silver, a firm started by Mr. Beaty and for which he is the Chairman of the Board, was mostly a purchase of a single asset, the Escobal mine in Guatemala, which has been shut down for three years as a result of local unrest. The mine is not yet operating, in part due to COVID and a change in government, which slowed regulatory approvals. Still, Pan American's success in advancing towards a restart, when Tahoe management had none, is a prime example of Mr. Beaty's skill at navigating troubled
waters.
  For Lumina investors, the political risk does not appear significant enough to warrant an adjustment to our price in sale expectations articulated above.

This is a lengthy first post, but we wanted to hit all the details to do the idea justice. We believe Ascendis Pharma (NASDAQ: ASND) can be one of the rare compounders in biopharma, and at a price of $153 per share (and an $8.2B market cap), we believe the stock can increase at least 2.2-2.5x over the next five years, with current upside at ~59%.
Executive Summary
The crux of our thesis resides in Ascendis's proprietary TransCon technology. TransCon is a simple three-part system that can increase the half-life of any molecule without altering its innate properties. While efforts over the past three decades have tried and failed to replace the oft-ineffective standard of PEGylation, all have compromised the molecule's efficacy to some degree. TransCon is the first to achieve ~100% bioactivity. The mechanics are elegant: a parent drug is inactivated by a linker, which is attached to a protective coat. As the TransCon carrier approaches the appropriate body pH and temperature conditions, the linker dissolves and releases a completely unaltered drug. Scientists can moderate the rate and speed at which these linkers dissolve, ensuring complete control over the molecule's half-life. Through this method, Ascendis can increase the half-life of certain molecules by over 1000x.
There are two use cases for TransCon. First, it can lengthen the half-life of an existing functional parent drug. Second, TransCon can create first-in-class medicines by targeting non-competitive disease areas where fleeting half-lives have made treatments suboptimal. Both use cases are perfectly suited for endocrinology, where patients must always keep hormone levels steady. The number of specialized endocrinologists in the US is also very low, significantly mitigating SG&A efforts. Ascendis currently has three drugs in its endocrine pipeline – TransCon hGH, TransCon CNP, and TransCon PTH.
TransCon hGH: The first growth hormones were clinically tested in 1981 and the paradigm has not changed since. To receive the full effect, children require daily injections that are inconvenient, painful, and stressful for parents. This adds up to >1400 injections over a child's development.
Today, most patients and physicians do not even question the practicality of a daily injection regimen. This ironically makes for a fascinating value proposition – with TransCon hGH, Ascendis's weekly growth hormone, the number of injections can be reduced by over 1200. Physicians are getting a therapy they never even knew they wanted. For these reasons, we believe long-acting growth hormones (LAGHs) will be the standard of care by 2027.
We believe the LAGH market is currently undervalued. Analysts do not understand that increased compliance to therapy can significantly expand a market. Currently, injection burden causes children to skip ~2 injections a week out of seven. This translates to a 70% rate of compliance. With a once-weekly injection, compliance should increase dramatically to ~90%. Growth hormone is sold by the milligram; the more milligrams sold, the more sales the drug does. With around 30% more milligrams consumed weekly, the GH market is due for an immediate expansion by almost 30%.
Currently, there is another LAGH effort by Pfizer/OPKO seeking approval. While Pfizer is a commercial titan, we believe its threats are being overestimated for the following reasons:
In non-inferiority trials that compared LAGHs to daily GH, TransCon hGH was found to be clinically superior. OPKO's somatragon was merely non-inferior. While the difference is only a matter of centimeters, the ""superiority"" label carries great clinical relevance; after all, why use a daily growth hormone when Ascendis offers one that is more convenient and functionally stronger? With such command, Ascendis is positioned to negotiate a price premium – an opportunity it may trade off for a faster revenue ramp against OPKO and the current GH standards.
 TransCon hGH offers an unmodified growth hormone, while OPKO's is modified. The effects are vast; somatragon only slightly reduced truncal adiposity in critical trials, a metric that physicians rank high on their checklist when selecting LAGHs. Based on preclinical AUC curves and Cmax results, Ascendis should ensure reduction in truncal adiposity consistent with a daily growth hormone.
Many analysts raise concerns about TransCon hGH's high IGF-1 levels in clinical trials. They seem to forget that IGF-1 is biologically a good thing. In fact, growth hormones are designed to increase IGF-1 levels. After several interviews, we learned that physicians do not prioritize this very highly. If the levels grow toxic, most experts just decrease the dose.
Even if Ascendis loses the battle to Pfizer/OPKO with a 40-60% market share, it will have a $1B drug at minimum in a >$5B market by 2027. Assuming a more reasonable 60-40% split, peak sales could approach $2B by 2030.
TransCon PTH: Hyperparathyroidism (HP) patients are some of the most ignored in the US, with most endocrinologists unaware about how many patients exist. But the disease is psychologically debilitating. Because of their inability to produce parathyroid hormone, patients are susceptible to ""calcium crashes"": extreme cramps in every muscle in the body (even the larynx!) prompted by critically low calcium levels. Currently, no standard-of-care exists. Patients are instead placed on dozens of calcium and vitamin D supplements that must be precisely timed throughout the day; if even one is missed, the patient risks crashing. It explains why HP patients live in a state of constant fear; 85% mention an inability to do household chores, while 76% cannot work.
Takeda-Shire's Natpara is the only treatment available for HP patients, but it is highly flawed. First, it does not solve the problem. Physiological PTH levels must be flat, which is difficult considering the hormone's three-hour half-life. If patients wanted to be fully stable, they would have to take eight Natpara injections a day; one daily injection only halves the pill burden while making crashes a bit more bearable. Second, Natpara has been mired in commercial woes from the very beginning. Sensing the solution would be incomplete, Shire deprioritized the project to focus on other drugs. As a result, a small number of HP endocrinologists are responsible for the majority of Natpara's annual sales at ~$300M. And after the Takeda merger, the drug was never even marketed in the EU. All these problems came to heads when Natpara was recalled from shelves in late 2019 after certain container defects were revealed. Suddenly, ~2700 patients were forced back on calcium pills, hundreds of whom calcium crashed within two weeks.
TransCon PTH can be a game changer. With a daily injection overlapping the drug's three-day half-lives, the infusion profile remains flat making it a first-in-class full-replacement therapy. But more importantly, Ascendis has been aggressive about seeing the release through. In response to the Natpara recall for instance, Ascendis promptly enrolled 19 patients to the Phase II trials. In doing so, it successfully recreated a Phase III trial. 57 patients were scheduled for treatment in the Phase III trial; 59 were treated in Phase II. A whopping 80% of TransCon PTH patients had their pill burdens eradicated completely; Natpara had none. If Ascendis could present a convincing case to bypass a Phase III trial, an emergency-use designation might have been presented by the FDA.
Unfortunately, Ascendis has showed no signs of progress, and the market has reacted poorly in response. We believe this reaction is overblown. If anything, the excellent Phase II data de-risks a Phase III trial entirely; it makes TransCon PTH's ultimate approval all but a guarantee. Furthermore, without any human data beforehand, TransCon PTH's dosing algorithm was 80% successful. With data on the first human cohorts, Ascendis can now modify the algorithm to draw closer to 100% - and if TransCon PTH eradicates supplements entirely, it literally cannot be improved. Given these points, we remain optimistic about the Phase III trials. We think the uncertainty around them makes this story even more compelling.
Our commercial TransCon PTH thesis ultimately comes down to TAM expansion. Citing Natpara's revenues, analysts believe the feasible market is only $1B in size. However, with ~80,000 patients in the US and Natpara's annual price tag of $115,000, we believe the domestic market alone presents a $8B opportunity. Add in the European market, and this number jumps even higher. With even 15-20% of US patients, Ascendis should have a $2B-a-year drug by 2030. Our model uses this $2B annual rate as a floor on the valuation. Realistically though, we believe TransCon PTH's revenues can increase much higher, up to $3-4B overall. The deciding factor will be the number of physicians Ascendis can educate. PTH endocrinologists self-organize into a sort of hub-and-spoke model, with most endocrinologists referring severe patients to only a few select experts. To the extent that Ascendis succeeds in selling down the spokes, TransCon PTH's TAM may have a long runway ahead.
TransCon CNP: Over the next five years, a wave of first-in-class treatments will enter the market for achondroplasia or dwarfism. These treatments occupy one of two categories: they are either direct or indirect inhibitors of an important developmental receptor called FGFR. Biologically, the indirect approach is safer. It is comfortably distanced from the core pathway, and so the propensity to induce more unpredictable chaos in the body is largely mitigated.
Unfortunately, the indirect inhibitor is a peptide called C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) with only a 3–5-minute half-life. The race for CNP-based therapies, therefore, has centered around increasing the half-life as much as possible. BioMarin's vosoritide, which will hit the markets this year, managed to increase it to 3 hours: enough for a daily injection and only a few centimeters. Using TransCon, Ascendis could increase CNP's half life over nearly 1200 times, from three minutes to 3.5 days. This not only enables a weekly injection, but also ""superiority"" over vosoritide's standard-of-care.
This value proposition almost exactly mimics TransCon hGH's, and we believe the likeness is fully intentional. By laying the groundwork for CNP's commercialization, TransCon hGH should recruit enough growth endocrinologists to accelerate CNP's growth ramp. This strategy however is highly dependent on the efficacy readouts in Phase II trials. We are careful to temper our assumptions about TransCon CNP in their absence – though considering TransCon's track record so far, it is unlikely that something goes wrong. A very likely scenario however is that achondroplasia drugs in general do not promote growth to the same degree that a growth hormone treatment does. Vosoritide only increased average height by ~1.71 cm/year; if TransCon CNP performs similarly, the incentive to pay will be marginal. Achondroplasia marks a roughly $5B market, but considering the difference, we only believe ~30% will accept therapy. Put together, we believe ~$1.5B can be distributed among all the players, and unless we see remarkable efficacy, we believe CNP sales will reach ~$600M by 2029.
Additional Upside: In addition to the points mentioned above, a platform includes several additional sources of upside. First, TransCon hGH is currently in Phase III in adult patients. Should it get approved, we believe it can significantly edge out competitors OPKO and Novo Nordisk for the leading adult LAGH. This is because truncal adiposity is the most important metric for adults, and here, both competitors fall short. As the only LAGH that enables precise tissue and fat distribution of its peers, Ascendis should add another $100M of revenue from the adult segment by 2029. More importantly though, Ascendis will kick-start the development of its TransCon Oncology pipeline in 2021, which will be a new suite of products that can enhance the immune response against a tumor. These are not cancer cures. Instead, they are immune system stimulants that can be used as complementors to lead cancer therapies like PD-1s and CAR-T cells. But in a $150B industry, there are still sizeable markets – and most importantly, there are several use cases in the body. Much like the endocrine pipeline, Ascendis is pursuing well-validated targets that can greatly differentiate themselves with TransCon's sustained release. Given the early stage, we do not assign any valuation to Ascendis's oncology pipeline, but we believe it will play a significant role in Ascendis's second stage of growth.
Valuation: We perform two valuations. For both, we use the same probability-adjusted revenue estimates, marking TransCon hGH at $2B, TransCon PTH at $1.8B, and TransCon CNP at $350M by 2029. Bear in mind, we were especially conservative with our PTH estimates; we really wanted to reflect its floor of ~$5B as an extreme base-case for Ascendis, leaving plenty of room for pleasant surprise. With a WACC of 10.90% and a 3% terminal growth rate, our DCF estimates yield a value of $242/share, or a 59% increase over current prices with additional upside for TransCon Oncology. Our second valuation method used 8 commercial and pipeline-heavy biotechs to arrive at an EV/revenue multiple of 8.54x. We then applied this to our revenue projections, outputting a 5- year CAGR of 17%. Even though our comps do not fully reflect Ascendis's platform potential, we like this method because it somewhat captures Ascendis's open TAM. Most biotech companies are normally capped at a certain TAM; developing a new product means starting at square one. TransCon on the other hand puts Ascendis in a position to create de-risked products with a repeatable algorithm. In doing so, Ascendis's TAM is virtually limitless. This is a rare phenomenon in biotech, but if our read is right, one could potentially hold Ascendis for a long time to come.

 Detailed Report
In biotech, like most forms of investing, risk and value are inversely related. The difference is that this relationship is brittle. It relies on a certain scientific depth, one that is either validated or destroyed with each binary event over a drug's development. Indeed, this is where the best biotech investors make their marks, and most others flee. ""If the possibility (much less the promise) of future free cash flows is based on speculation and unknown science,"" the risk-averse seem to say, ""count me out.""
That said, realized value can be massive amid this uncertainty, and so most science-focused investors set about discerning the biological and clinical truths to identify the winners. Lost in the clamor is the limelight on sustainable compounders. Such compounders appear in two breeds. The first are the ""commercializers"", companies that can identify winning molecules better than investors and successfully bring them to market. The second are the ""R&D engines'', those that pump out molecule after molecule incurring as little R&D risk as possible. For this latter group, processes must be repeatable and platforms reliable, and in both regards, we believe Ascendis Pharma (NASDAQ: ASND) is as good as they come. Ascendis is a Danish-American company valued at $8.2B, with three products in mid-to-late-stage development. Under its unique and ever-reliable TransCon platform, each product is de-risked further by the one before it: a winning combination for a biopharma company.
But we do not focus on the platform through most of this write-up. Instead, we dive deep into the science and clinical development, building up a sum-of-the-parts valuation much like an ordinary biotech investor might. In doing so, our question is implicit: if Ascendis on its own is undervalued, how much more undervalued is the platform? When discussing the platform itself, the markets Ascendis chooses, and the vision for the future, we believe there is more to Ascendis' potential than meets the eye. By the end of this lengthy read, we hope you will feel so too.
__________________________________________________________________ 
  Part 1: Introduction to Ascendis
TransCon is an elegant, repeatable, and highly de-risked platform that enables the whole pipeline to succeed.
So, what is TransCon technology? TransCon, or ""transient conjugation"", is a simple but innovative drug delivery system that can extend the half-life of virtually any small molecule, protein peptide, antibody, or antibody fragment within a specified size threshold.
Let us break this definition down. A drug-delivery system is the process by which a drug is introduced into the body. When engineering or implementing a drug-delivery system, scientists must consider the nuances. Where in the body does the drug need to go? How do we make sure it is not excreted? How do we control its release rate? These questions only scratch the surface of a vast effort in science. A half-life is defined as the ""length of time required for the concentration of a particular substance to decrease to half of its starting dose in the body."" If a doctor injects 100 mg of drug into your body, you will only have 50 mg of drug left after one half-life. After two, that decreases to 25 mg.
The half-life of a critical protein, in some cases, may be as short as a few seconds. TransCon technology can increase this, and it is the first platform that has successfully been validated to do so. Historically, scientists turned to a process called PEGylation, by which they expose a parent drug to small polymers called polyethylene glycols (PEGs). These polyethylene glycols then covalently link to each other, creating a thick coat. Because the PEGylated molecule has a radius that is five to ten times larger than the molecule alone, it will be excreted much slower and the half-life increases.
Where PEGylation fails is that the drug loses its activity, even as its physical half-life increases. Seeing as the two phenomenon counteract, this is not a problem for most compounds – a less active form of the drug is just present in the body longer. However, assuming the compound loses activity too quickly, one must look outside PEGylation for a solution. In most cases, this means changing the structural properties of the molecule itself, which usually leads to other unforeseen problems in the body.
TransCon technology comprises of three components: the prodrug, the carrier, and the linker. The prodrug (perhaps the easiest to understand) is an unchanged existing compound. The carrier is modelled off the earlier ""permanently"" PEGylated models; however, the TransCon polymer carrier is now built off a four-arm structure that is placed close to – but not directly on – the compound's surface. Finally, the third and most critical component, the linker, has a dual function. The first is to link the prodrug to the carrier, eliminating any contact between the two. The second is to hydrolyze and cleave when the molecule approaches the right pH and temperature conditions, deploying a newly activated prodrug into the tissue over a sustained and extended period of time. In this way, scientists can gauge the half-life of the TransCon compound accurately. Upon release, the carrier and the linker are excreted renally, while the prodrug acts on its targets.
Ascendis has a total of seven fundamental linker classes, each with dozens of linkers each. The linkers are fitted with different properties, with half-lives ranging between a day and six months, and with specificity for different drug chemistries. The linkers are also stable at room temperature storage conditions. This range makes TransCon incredibly versatile. It gives Ascendis a virtually endless mandate over possible drug candidates, allowing them to be extremely selective when looking for the best indications to tackle.
Despite TransCon's archetypal qualities, the uncertainty lies in the platform's efficacy. If TransCon were to fail for one compound, that would likely bode negative for the others. This threat however has been mitigated – if not eradicated completely – by preclinical and clinical evidence put forth by the company. Some of the very first structural experiments on TransCon HGH revealed that the structure of a native hormone molecule matched exactly with the structure built for TransCon hGH. Bioactivity assays between the released drug and the hormone were 100% identical as well. Off decades of recombinant hGH molecules generated in the past, these in-human similarity thresholds have never been reached. In TransCon hGH's first clinical trials, the case for the platform was furthered by remarkable phenotypic evidence; changes in typical markers like lipids, glucose, HbA1c, or insulin were all in line with the daily growth hormone variant. The same likenesses have been exactly replicated in TransCon PTH and CNP as well. With a three-for-three track record (notwithstanding a fourth molecule that was discontinued at an early stage for unrelated reasons in 2017), TransCon is virtually de-risked.
Such reliability is a rare occurrence in biotech; setting aside the argument for Halozyme, I challenge anyone to find another TransCon. Two conclusions logically follow. First, investors are not wrong to assign a higher ""probability-of-success"" to Ascendis' entire development-stage pipeline. Even an 80% PoS for TransCon CNP – unadvisable for just about any other Phase II compound – is not unreasonable. Second, this reliability makes Jan Mikkelson's long-term vision of building a biotech behemoth a reality. Ascendis is on track to release one drug every two years, similar to Regeneron, Genmab, or Seattle Genetics. Many of these drugs are likely blockbuster candidates given the concentrated physician bases and a relative lack of competition. Furthermore, much like these three companies, Ascendis is extremely careful about partnerships, maintaining total control over their endocrinology pipeline. I do not suggest a similar valuation makes sense now, but assuming a competent commercialization strategy, it may not be out-of-discussion in the next five years.
  Jan Mikkelsen has been consistent and ambitious about his goal since the beginning.
Ascendis's CEO is Jan Mikkelsen, a scientist by training. Mikkelsen started his career at Novo Nordisk, where he grew to an executive role on the R&D side. He then left to start his own small biotech in 1999, Profound Pharma, which he sold to American company Maxygen for around $80M in only ten months. Most companies require years to even agree on a preclinical product; ten months for a fledgling biotech company is a feat almost unheard of. Three years later, Mikkelsen unveiled another Denmark-based pharmaceutical company, LifeCycle Pharma (now Veloxis A/S). At the time, it was one of the few biotech companies that successfully listed in the country. LifeCycle's platform MeltDose was much like a first-generation TransCon. It incorporates a parent drug into a ""meltable"" vehicle which is then sprayed onto an inert carrier. In doing so, the size of the overall drug increases, much like the TransCon carrier increases the size of its own parent drugs. By moderating the speed and amount of melting that occurs, LifeCycle could control the drug's release profile to increase its half-life. In 2006 however, Mikkelsen came across TransCon technology, which he saw as a significant upgrade over MeltDose and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. He left LifeCycle at the height of its fame in 2006 to found Ascendis, and he has led the company ever since.
Mikkelsen's ambition is the stuff of legends; according to one Danish newspaper, he turned down a buyout offer back in 2010 by Novo Nordisk for over $400M, even before starting clinical development. Considering this, his somewhat heretic choice to keep the core endocrine pipeline totally royalty-free, even in the face of Novo Nordisk and Pfizer's competition, makes a lot of sense. However, he is also a strategist. The 'Vision 20x20"" plan he presented in 2016 has checked all its boxes, culminating in the full development of Ascendis's endocrine pipeline. With this in mind, we believe the goals on his recently-unveiled Vision 3x3 plan – which includes regulatory approval for three products and nine indications by 2024 as well as the introduction of a new independent therapeutic area by 2025 – are well achievable. Mikkelsen's track record speaks volumes in an industry where goals only rarely materialize, and we remain optimistic about his leadership through Ascendis's next phase of growth.
 __________________________________________________________________ 
 Part 2: The Endocrine Pipeline
With three highly carefully chosen shots in the endocrinology arena, Ascendis's sights are set on becoming a rare disease endocrinology leader. But why this specific niche?
One feature of endocrinology that sets it apart is the requirement of regulation. Hormones, by nature, are homeostatic; for humans to think, sleep, and grow properly, they must always be present in perfect balance. Where endocrinology diseases come up, this balance is disrupted – and it becomes the physician's goal to restore it. The concept of a ""depot injection"" is therefore fundamental to the field. Rather than infusing hormone every few hours and creating spikes of hormonal concentration, why not create a solution that allows a mass of hormone to diffuse gradually over time? 
TransCon is perfectly suited for this. Furthermore, most endocrinologists treat larger indications like diabetes, leaving a concentrated bunch to tackle the rest. We were surprised to see just how interconnected growth hormone endocrinologists were in our own surveys; at a top-five Ivy-League medical system, we found only two physicians focusing on pediatric GHD with sparse connections throughout the region. Hyperparathyroidism was noticeably smaller. Given these observations, we are inclined to believe Ascendis' claims that sales efforts in endocrinology are focused and heavily reliant on word-of-mouth.
Finally, given the minutes-long half-lives of certain molecules, there remains a high unmet need in numerous diseases. Ascendis has picked two – hyperparathyroidism and achondroplasia – and it is well-positioned to create near-first-in-class solutions for both.
In this section, we will be breaking down Ascendis's three rare disease endocrinology candidates: TransCon hGH, TransCon PTH, and TransCon CNP. We believe certain developments with TransCon PTH point to a brilliant clinical design that is being either overlooked or misinterpreted by investors unfamiliar with the HP landscape. These developments set a higher floor on Ascendis' valuation. With TransCon HGH, while the valuation is largely baked in, we believe the market is currently undervaluing the ramp to peak sales given our conversations with pediatric endocrinologists. Criticisms of TransCon HGH's clinical design are also being blown out of proportion. And while TransCon CNP is currently enrolling Phase II trials, we believe its clinical strategy perfectly replicates hGH's, which helps CNP grow even faster.
  Long-acting growth hormones (LAGHs) will be the new standard of care by 2027
Steve Jobs once said, ""Our job is to figure out what [customers] are going to want before they do."" Replace that ""want"" with a ""need,"" and you have the perfect set up for a biotech.
Jobs' quote specifically comes to mind when we consider the efforts over the last decade to replace a daily growth hormone (HGH) with a weekly formulation. Having used the same daily HGH over the past forty years, patients and physicians simply do not know any better. They bear the burden of 365 injections a year – around 1400 injections overall – without question. They accept the tough consequences of missing a few injections as an inevitability of human error.
First, a bit of clinical history will be helpful. Daily HGH was the first biologic drug ever, designed by Genentech in 1981. Since then, incremental modifications have only slightly increased the bar. In fact, as one OPKO executive pointed out, ""the only difference [between existing HGHs] really is the pen: some are fruit-based, some are glycolyzed, but they all essentially have the same product."" From our own conversations with prescribing endocrinologists, we have discovered that the current HGH landscape is a battle across formularies where the most affordable HGH typically wins out.
Over the last four decades, the attention has turned to a more important problem than fruit-based injection pens: extending the half-life of HGH and developing a weekly injection. This long-acting growth hormone (LAGH) is a great improvement over its predecessors. Efficacy-wise, two out of every three children miss at least one dose of HGH a week, with each missed dose costing around 3 to 6 inches in total height. Two missed doses can cost up to one foot, while three nearly negates the impact of growth hormone altogether. From a quality-of-life perspective, an LAGH can save a child 1,200 injections over the course of childhood. Many parents also schedule their lives around administering shots, a process that is both emotionally taxing and guilt-inducing. And logistically, we interviewed twelve physicians about their thoughts on the LAGH. All twelve indicated they would prescribe it immediately.
The current daily HGH market is worth ~$4B, with 90% of the market split across five players: Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly, Genentech, Pfizer, and Merck Serono. Given its decades-long maturity, we only identify two meaningful drivers. The first is the FDA's approval of HGH for patients in the bottom 1% of their age range in 2003, which improved the total prevalence of HGH-eligible patients from 3 to 120 per 10,000 beneficiaries. Today, there are around 150,000 children worldwide who are prescribed HGH, and the number steadily grows at ~2.4% a year. On the other hand, companies must regularly negotiate lower prices with payers to undercut the competition. Price reductions counter the growing population of users, thereby keeping the HGH market relatively stagnant.
The first LAGHs will be released in 2021, and over the next five to seven years, LAGHs will overtake daily hormones as the standard-of-care. This replacement may be gradual, seeing as most of today's physicians were medically trained on the first daily growth hormones and have been prescribing them ever since. Some even want to observe the entire four-year cycle firsthand. However, historical evidence suggests that this switch could be swift. In 2009, 25% of all GH insurance beneficiaries switched from branded to generic growth hormone, in response to cheaper prices. In 2015, 14% of beneficiaries switched out of a needle-free generic produced by Teva to a needle-containing branded version of GH, a response to the former's lack of efficacy. Inflection points are addressed quickly in the growth hormone timeline, and the LAGHs will be the largest change yet.
We believe improved compliance and increased pricing can grow the global market from ~$3.5B to at least ~$5B. Intuition backs the compliance argument: growth hormone, like all drugs, are priced by the dosing amount. By increasing the number of doses, the amount of drug consumed increases as well, and the price increases accordingly. If we rationally assume that hGH compliance sits at around 70% (i.e., the average patient takes ~5 injections out of the 7 prescribed every week), an increase to 100% compliance under a once-a-week regimen would take increase the market by 1.3x. Our more conservative assumptions assume that patients will miss a single injection every six weeks, translating to ~85% compliance or a ~15% increase in the current market.
  TransCon hGH's ""superiority"" over the current daily growth hormone has great clinical relevance.
Mechanistically, HGH directly and indirectly induces growth in every tissue and organ. Whereas HGH binding directly stimulates bone and cartilage growth, it indirectly increases the release of a chemical called insulin growth-factor-1 (IGF-1) that builds peripheral tissues while also generating the energy that fuels growth. While HGH is directly responsible for around 20% of growth, IGF-1 causes the other 80%. In the absence of HGH, patients suffer from several different conditions classified as growth hormone deficiencies (GHD). 90% of these patients are children who suffer from height disorders, while the other 10% are adults struggling with tissue growth dysfunction.
There are currently three companies in the lead to release long-acting growth hormones by 2027 – Ascendis, OPKO Health, and Novo Nordisk. Each product is structurally different. While Ascendis uses an unmodified growth hormone, OPKO and Novo Nordisk are both modified growth hormones. While a modified growth hormone chemically alters the original HGH sequence to increase its half-life, its unmodified counterpart keeps the growth hormone intact. Past iterations have shown that by modifying the growth hormone's structure, a patient can risk unanticipated tissue and fat distribution effects. In the end, history favors the novel unmodified approach as a new frontier to growth biology.
When we surveyed physicians, we wanted to understand their criteria when picking an LAGH. The survey highlighted seven primary aspects of a GH treatment and asked physicians to rank all seven by importance. In order of priority, here were the results:
Serious adverse events
Decreasing truncal adiposity
Inferiority to daily HGH treatment
Minor adverse events
Insurance coverage
Elevated peak IGF-1 levels
Needle length
In the following sections, we will be breaking each of these down. Ascendis has the edge in Criteria 2, 3, 4, and 7; OPKO takes 6. Criteria 1 is similar across all three competitors, and Criteria 5 is too early to tell. Furthermore, the following sections will focus on each candidate's clinical profile, which we believe is the single most important feature of any drug's success on the market.
Decreased Truncal Adiposity
Truncal adiposity is belly or waist fat, and it is known to present cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in adults. It is linked to the amount of growth hormone in the body; if IGF-1 is neither sufficient nor uniformly distributed, severe metabolic effects take place that can be confirmed by a growing layer of belly fat. Put more succinctly, GH levels are inversely correlated with truncal adiposity.
In both quantity and distribution of hormone, Ascendis holds the clear advantage. TransCon HGH's IGF-1 levels are higher than the daily growth hormone, and with an unmodified LAGH, doctors need not worry about tissue and fat distribution. OPKO, on the other hand, has struggled to meet these requirements in adults. In a failed Phase III study for adult growth hormone deficiency in 2017, the results indicated no change in truncal adiposity. According to management, the results were caused by outliers in the data set, the removal of which were OK'd by the FDA. In the three years since however, OPKO has not submitted an adult HGH filing – regardless of their strategy, we take this as a poor sign. And turning to Novo Nordisk, Sogroya was approved in adult patients with a 1.06% decrease – half the 2.23% decrease demonstrated by daily HGH.
Superiority Average Height Velocity
The most basic requirement of a pediatric growth hormone is that its patient must grow. The taller he or she is, the better the hormone.
Compared to the daily growth hormone, TransCon HGH had demonstrated not just noninferior but superior results in average height velocity (AHV), helping the patient grow at 11.2 cm/year against the daily growth hormone's 10.3 cm/year. It must also be noted that the daily HGH patients in the trial's control arm claimed an adherence of ~99%, an unrealistic assumption where real world evidence suggests daily HGH adherence is closer to 70%. Factor this in, and the difference should increase from 0.9 cm (11.2 – 10.3 cm) to 2-3 cm. Taken together, these results create a solid case for Ascendis's approval and appeal. It makes little sense to take a daily growth hormone over a weekly formulation that also does a better job, and patients and physicians both realize this.
These ""superior"" results were internally anticipated – perhaps even intended – by management. Phase II studies on 53 patients had a similar AHV difference (12.9 cm vs. 11.6 cm on Genotropin), so with a larger cohort of patients, statistical significance could be achieved. But the word ""superiority"" offers management an important tool when negotiating premiums with payers. Today, each of the five growth hormones are priced at around $25,000. If any of the incumbents wanted to apply competitive pressure to LAGHs, they could perhaps decrease prices by ~10%, but no more. Factoring in a 20-25% increase based on LAGH adherence, the average LAGH could sell for ~$32,000 per patient. This (plus perhaps a slight premium based on convenience) is the ceiling for OPKO and Novo Nordisk's pricing strategy. Ascendis on the other hand has two options for pricing. It could leverage its ""superior"" results to negotiate a higher premium with insurance companies, receiving more per patient. Or it could charge a much smaller premium in line with OPKO and Novo Nordisk, broaden HGH access, and accelerate their revenue ramp. In doing so, Ascendis can compete head-on with existing daily HGH – it makes TransCon hGH a no-brainer for physicians and payers alike.
Minor Adverse Events
Adverse events are far less important for weekly growth hormones than daily growth hormones, so physicians only take note of the serious ones. In most ways, the safety profiles of all three drugs seem about the same with one notable omission: injection-site reactions and pain. Ascendis has a distinct advantage here: it uses a 4mm needle while OPKO uses an 8mm. This translates to far fewer safety events – Ascendis did not report any injection site pain or reaction statistics out-of-line with Genotropin. Contrast this to the colorful adverse event profile illustrated by OPKO: injection site pain was experienced by 39% of patients (vs. 25% in control group) and 9-13% prevalence of injection site reactions (vs. 0% in the control group).
One physician mentioned to us that injection-site reactions and pains were both ""non-starters"". This makes sense given that most hGH patients are smaller children, and we believe a predictable safety profile will be a strong selling point for Ascendis going forward.
  The criticisms directed toward TransCon HGH's high IGF-1 levels are overblown.
We wanted to devote a long section to IGF-1, because we believe the market significantly exacerbates an issue that, frankly, physicians don't pay much attention to. Because while a common fallacy about IGF-1's dangers are spreading in critic circles, people seem to forget that high IGF-1 levels are good. Most patients prescribed GH fall into the bottom 0.5% in IGF-1 levels. HGH is intended to increase IGF-1 levels, which stimulates growth; in Ascendis' case, baseline patients for the Phase III trial had IGF-1 levels that were, on average, two standard deviations (SDS) below their age group's mean IGF-1 levels. An effective growth hormone could increase that substantially.
That said, too much of a good thing can hurt, and Ascendis's data about TransCon HGH's strength sparked concerns. The safety threshold for IGF-1 levels is <2 SDS above the age-based mean. Beyond this, people foresee an increased likelihood of long-term illness, including cancers and diabetes. The finer results are presented below.
The results of a separate but simultaneous Phase III trial, the fliGHt trial, added fuel to this fire. The fliGHt trial was designed as a ""switch"" trial, illustrating to physicians that patients could be switched to TransCon HGH from another hormone. The focus here was less so on AHV, and more pointed toward safety, and while patients experiences almost no safety issues (apart from 2 dropouts due to non-study-related issues), IGF-1 mean levels came in at an extremely high 1.7 SDS. 55/141 patients had mean IGF levels >2 SDS, while 22 of those patients were >3.
      While some might cite valid cause for concerns, we think these IGF-1 levels are not a barrier to acceptance. We have compiled our thoughts on the matter into eight distinct points:
IGF-1-dependent dose reductions are standard clinical practice. In our early outreach, many physicians pointed this out without us asking. Note the strange units used for GH doses – ""24 mg/kg/week"". Not 24 mg/week. In other words, HGH dosing is highly variable, and it changes with the weight of each patient. It can also change with a physician's judgment. When IGF-1 levels increase beyond 2, physicians are trained to dial it back to the 2 SDS level by cutting the dose.
No physician opted to reduce dose and almost all patients joined enliGHten. In the heiGHt trial, Ascendis gave physicians the option to decrease IGF-1 doses by 20% if IGF-1 levels were above the safety threshold. Only 2% of physicians opted to do so in both the TransCon HGH and Genotropin arms, demonstrating that most physicians were unbothered with IGF-1 levels. Furthermore, Ascendis launched a three-year long-term follow up study to the Phase III trials called enliGHten. While patient participation was considered optional, 296/307 heiGHt and fliGHt patients opted in. While free medication is a great incentive, we believe physician uptake will be faster than many anticipate given the enthusiasm.
Approved IGF-1 levels have exceeded 3.0 SDS before. For instance, Humatrope in idiopathic short stature patients demonstrated peak IGF-1 levels >2.0 in 30% of patients and >3.0 SDS in 8% of patients. Nutropin in pubertal GH deficiency patients also demonstrated IGF-1 SDS >3.0 in 40% of patients. We believe these trials justify an almost-certain 90% probability of success for TransCon HGH.
By GHRS standards, high IGF-1 peaks are irrelevant. The Growth Hormone Research Society issued the following statement on LAGHs in 2016: 
""Unlike the experience with daily GH, both the appropriate timing of blood sampling and the interpretation of the IGF1 standard deviation score (SDS) in LAGH-treated patients are controversial… the goal is to maintain serum IGF1 concentrations within the normal age-appropriate range for a majority of the treatment period."" 
The bolded section is critical; it suggests that, as long as the IGF-1 are mostly below 2.0 SDS, the        LAGH should be considered safe. This was agreed upon by 55 pediatric endocrinologists around the world and has since become a standard for HGH clinical trial decision support.
Ascendis is the only LAGH developer that pursued a switch trial. Competitors like OPKO and Novo Nordisk decided not to, which may make physicians worry about switching patients over to the respective LAGHs.
The enliGHten trial suggest that TransCon HGH rescued Genotropin patients. During the enliGHten trial, all Genotropin patients were switched to TransCon HGH. As it turned out, poor responders for Genotropin were rescued, with the ratio of IGF-1 levels between poor responders and responders increasing 27% in six months. Clearly, the IGF-1 is directly responsible for increased height in TransCon HGH.
heiGHt IGF-1 data is being interpreted wrongly. What truly matters above all is ""consecutive measurements >2.0"", which represents whether a patient experienced IGF-1 spikes >2.0 SDS at two points on either side of a 13-week interval. 8.6%, is quite a solid number; OPKO by comparison found 3/109 patients or 3%, which is not far off.
FliGHt trial data matters will not matter in ~2.5-3 years. Some may still find the IGF-1 levels concerning, but because of the four-year cycle for growth hormone treatment, all patients currently on daily growth hormone will have finished therapy in the next four years. Within ~2.5 years, Ascendis' marketing strategy will probably just rely on heiGHt and enliGHten data.
Of course, IGF-1 levels still could be a concern for physician uptake. That said, we believe the ramp to peak sales is being far too underestimated, especially considering that TransCon will have ~6-8 months of market exclusivity before OPKO begins marketing its HGH. We predict 50% of physicians will have converted to LAGHs by 2027, making the total global market for LAGHs (post-compliance adjustments) around ~$2.5-3B. Assuming Ascendis captures 60% of this market by then– plausible seeing as OPKO's data falls slightly short and Novo Nordisk will not reach market until 2024 – it could do anywhere up to $2B in peak sales.
  Commercialization will be tough – but Ascendis is positioned to win…
Taking the points above into consideration, Ascendis has the best-in-class product. So, what now?
We believe 'now' is where one must tread carefully. A first-time retail investor lured into biotech by sticky cash flows, high barriers-to-entry, or an innovative technology may feel compelled to invest in a company just out of the development gates, citing the attractive lack of scientific risk. However, commercialization and development are two very different games. A company with a stellar scientific direction – even if it is a platform company – often falls frustratingly short of projected sales.
Pfizer is no joke either. With physician networks spanning around the globe, not to mention an established grasp over 13% of the world's human growth hormone market with Genotropin, the Pfizer foothold is strong. Ascendis, the 15-year-old $9B upstart, going up against the 150-year-old $200B titan, may as well be biotech's own David and Goliath.
But Ascendis has the best-in-class product. The significance of a best-in-class product varies by therapeutic area. A rule of thumb we have found successful (so far, barring the exception of COVID-19) is that the higher the number of critically ill patients, the more the efficacy of that product matters. Marketing a slightly more effective asthma inhaler could prove a steep uphill battle if the current market leader is 100x larger than the developer. However, a metastatic cancer drug for an extremely small niche of patients without any working options will sell, regardless of how large or small the company is.
On paper, pediatric growth hormone deficiencies might not seem like chronic illnesses. However, for families with children of short stature, there is a psychological element that makes a growth hormone feel like a necessity. Parents realize their children have only a few critical years of growth left. They cannot say whether their children suffer from some condition or if they are naturally short, but they understand that treatment is available. This fear of missing a critical window is why most families accept the struggles of a 1400-injection regimen in the first place. It also justifies the inevitable decline in compliance as patients initially grow faster. A better hGH than the standard, given as a weekly injection with a smaller needle and no safety effects makes for a fantastic value proposition, one that compete with the likes of Pfizer already. Furthermore, there are only 1386 pediatric endocrinologists in the US, the majority of whom focus exclusively on diabetes. This is perfect for a lean, targeted sales operation, where each endocrinologist can be specifically handled and addressed. Management has also indicated that Novo Nordisk and Pfizer have started peeling back on their own GH sales operations, signaling the magnitude of the LAGH threat and a potential lack of competition for Ascendis to carry out sales.
Ascendis also has a four-month window between June and October where it will have critical market exclusivity. Management noted that switching trials would exclusively be a revenue driver during the first 2-2.5 years, and we imagine it will be especially critical early on. Finally, of all the physicians we spoke to, we found they were split around 60-40 in favor of Ascendis. When we asked the minority why they favored Pfizer, many of the responses we received were tied to insufficient data. This was peculiar because, after digging a little deeper, we confirmed that Ascendis had released most of the early data regarding bone age and tissue distribution that physicians were seeking. Across the small patient set, we believe both salesforces are at work, and we are impressed by Ascendis's progress so far. Also reassuring to us: of all the physicians who advocated Pfizer's product, none mentioned that IGF-1 levels were of significant concern.
  …and the key is management.
Still, a small subset of physicians paints a biased image. If David were to beat Goliath, pure force would be useless. Shrewdness, opportunity, and strategy however might just do it.
Along with everything else, we have a large vote of confidence in Ascendis' management, largely fueled by expertise.  In 2020, Mikkelsen hired fellow Dane and Novo Nordisk-alum Jesper Hoiland to head commercial operations at Ascendis. Hoiland started his career at Novo Nordisk in 1987, where he worked for thirteen years as a manager. Following this, he served in executive positions for 16 years, climbing his way to President of Novo Nordisk US. As an executive, he ran international marketing efforts for growth hormone, ultimately catapulting Norditropin to the top spot ahead of the industry's incumbents. He followed this up with similar successes in hemophilia and insulin. In 2016, Hoiland left to run Radius Health as CEO, a company that sold parathyroid hormone to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. While he was not overtly successful here (largely because of a failed breast cancer franchise), Hoiland helped Radius Health bring one of the first PTHs ever to market. Beyond growth hormone, this makes Jesper Hoiland one of the most credible commercial PTH experts in biotech.
In 2020, Hoiland received a call from Mikkelsen to run commercial efforts for Ascendis. Drawn in by an opportunity to reclaim his parathyroid and growth hormone roots, he accepted. Much like PTH, there are few in the industry that understand the growth hormone market as well as Hoiland does. He has seen this story before, Norditropin's David against Genentech's Goliath back in 2005, and he won. Today, he has the physician networks on hand and a strategy in place; we believe the odds favor him winning again.
   Hypoparathyroidism is a misunderstood disease with destructive effects on patients' lives.
We started the prior section with a quote by Steve Jobs. If anything, we believe it is even more applicable to hypoparathyroidism. Endocrinologists still underdiagnose the condition, while a shocking number refuse to acknowledge it at all. Patients, on the other hand, understand the lifestyle burden distinctly – 85% of patients are unable to perform any household activities, while 76% are unable to work in a professional setting at all. In some emergency-room settings, patients must plead with physicians for the necessary calcium infusions given the lack of awareness.
This is largely because hypoparathyroidism (HP) neither is life-threatening, nor is it particularly flashy. An ordinary calcium crash, to an outsider, makes its victim seem extremely drunk without any sense of coordination or coherence. Internally, however, every muscle in that patient's body – including the larynx – is cramping and spasming. Speaking and unobstructed breathing are non-options. Worse still, the violently fluctuating calcium levels lead to a brain fog which, even in a fully treated state, render the patient unable to think adequately. All this takes a psychological toll on the patient. Going out, working, and running errands are conflicted by the possibility of an unexpected calcium crash, and so many patients choose not to at all.
HP patients suffer a loss of parathyroid hormone (PTH), usually a consequence of pituitary surgery or heredity. Parathyroid hormone has a half-life of only three hours. As a result, few replacement therapies have been conceived, and the current standard-of-care walks an extremely fickle line between too much and too little. This standard-of-care is also unwieldy. One patient described a 21-pill regimen timed precisely over an ~18-hour day. Five doses of calcium anchored the regimen, and missing even one could lead to a calcium crash. Furthermore, calcium supplements increase and decrease in waves leading to cramp-ruined sleep, hypertension, inability to think, and ultimately, severe depression.
Situations like hypoparathyroidism, we feel, can make for great opportunities – the market is unrealized, under-appreciated, and likely to grow beyond expectation. 'Unrealized' because there are no existing treatments. 'Under-appreciated' because of the wide spectrum of patient experiences (some mild and some debilitating). And 'likely to grow' because, when fewer physicians can empathize with the patient population, something of a 'hub-and-spoke' model tends to emerge across physician population. In this case, most endocrinologists do not have the training to handle their patients' day-to-day concerns beyond an emergency calcium infusion, so they rely on small but vocal 'hubs' of physicians who specialize in HP patients. These doctors are well-aware of developments in the HP landscape and they are incredibly responsive to trying new treatments. When combined with a similarly passionate minority of patients, the enthusiasm for new therapies translates to a fast treatment uptake.
  HP has a $8B total addressable market that is only 3% penetrated.
There are ~80,000-100,000 patients who suffer from HP in the United States. There are also ~120,000 patients in the EU and ~35,000 in Asia. Assuming an annual cost of ~$100,000 a year, the US numbers alone work out to an 80,000 patients * $100,000 = $8,000,000,000 TAM.
But does the $100,000 price tag make sense? It does for a few reasons. First, with less than 200,000 patients in the US, synthetic PTH is classified as an orphan drug, thus enjoying greater pricing leniency and exclusivity. More importantly, TransCon PTH will not be the first solution in the HP market. That position belongs to Natpara, a recombinant parathyroid hormone produced by Takeda-Shire that operates as an ""adjunct"" to an HP patient's pill regimen. An ""adjunct"" is not a full replacement. It is a mitigating supplement that meaningfully decreases the pill regimen as well as the risk of a calcium crash. Even as a mitigant, Natpara has been priced at an estimated $115,000 in the US. A true replacement therapy, which can completely eradicate the calcium and vitamin D, should be priced even higher.
But we must factor in the reality of HP. Endocrinologists prescribe calcium, vitamin D, and other supplements by pure trial-and-error. The patient can't sleep through awful cramps? Try doubling the dose of calcium. Serum magnesium levels too low? Take a magnesium pill with dinner. Constantly in flux, a severe patient's condition must be addressed by an endless cycle of symptom management. Mild patients, by comparison, are easier to treat. With less severe pill regimens, a $100,000 daily injection might not make sense. Even despite this, the HP market remains massive. Let us assume that an extremely generous 90% of patients decide against taking TransCon PTH. Dividing the TAM by 10, our more realistic TAM arrives at $800M in the US alone. This can translate to ~$1.5B worldwide. As the only replacement therapy on the market, and with the clinical trial results we discuss below, Ascendis should capture the lion's share of this market, signaling a blockbuster drug in the making.
With $230M in revenues in 2018, Natpara owns a mere 3% of the US market after four years of commercialization. It could be a signal about patients' unwillingness to pay Takeda's price. But we think Natpara's value proposition is mostly responsible. Natpara is essentially a daily injection on top of a halved pill regimen; it cuts the severe 21-pill regimen to a 10-pill regimen plus one daily injection, only to calm down the symptoms. Few patients face such intense levels of pill burden: ~3% sounds about right. In nearly 80% of TransCon PTH patients however, a single daily shot cuts pill burden to 0 while eradicating symptoms altogether. Just how much more attractive this value proposition is remains to be seen.
Ascendis, for its part, has focused on spreading word as far as possible. In the context of the hub and spoke model, this means launching physician education initiatives that range beyond the hubs and branch into the spokes. Ultimately, the goal will be to attract moderately affected patients to TransCon PTH. While commercialization efforts are difficult to interpret at such an early stage, I believe there is ample real-world evidence to suggest that new, first-in-class therapies in areas with psychologically impactful unmet needs tend to scale brilliantly. Regeneron's Dupixent is a great example – while atopic dermatitis is not lethal, people do not want to leave their homes with awful rashes and itching. It is today projected to reach $10B in annual revenue over the next five years against a 2017 TAM of $5.4B. Pfizer's Lyrica is even more accurate – HP's shares many social parallels to epilepsy through a patient's fear of having a seizure in public. The drug chalked up $7B in revenues in 2018. The moral of this story? TAMs in biotech can increase dramatically, and with only a fraction captured of an untapped market, TransCon PTH's trajectory should be similar.
  There are no competitive alternatives to TransCon PTH.
Even without the capabilities of the parathyroid hormone, Natpara steadily grew US revenues from $24.4M in 2015 to $231M by YE2018. This was due to its profound effects on HP patients. Much like the Steve Jobs quote that headlines this section, once patients had a small taste of the quality-of-life improvements associated with an adjunct therapy, they clamored for more. Unfortunately, from an initial 200-patient base in 2015, it seems Shire realized that HP sales would require a serious education and awareness effort, which was not worth it given the drug's limited efficacy. In the five years since, the patient base has grown organically by word-of-mouth across the 'hubs', with doctors involved in the 2014 clinical trials taking on a critical role in scaling Natpara's impact.
Shire also turned its views to Europe, where it expected a large revenue boost from a patient population twice as big as in the US. It received a CE mark in late 2016, combined with NHS statements advocating for the drug. However, in 2018, talks with Shire collapsed entirely. We have not been able to find evidence for why this happened, but UK patients formed strong patient advocacy groups around it. Even with this strong demand, Natpara flopped internationally.
In September 2019, Natpara was suddenly recalled from shelves by Takeda-Shire on orders from the FDA. Toxic particulates from the container for Natpara were somehow found in the blood, presenting a critical safety issue. 358 critical patients were granted special use permission to continue on Natpara; the rest were left without treatment. The lack of treatment brought more problems than many physicians expected. Severe patients were placed back on calcium and vitamin D, but because of their acclimation to parathyroid hormone, calcium and vitamin D levels were totally uncertain, with some physicians reporting that they had to dose twice as much calcium (or twice as many pills) to stabilize the patient. Around one-hundred patients were reported to have been hospitalized within the first few weeks.
Natpara will remain on clinical hold well into 2021 or 2022. Without it, the HP market had no treatments available last year, and an established pool of patients was prepared to begin PTH therapy almost immediately.
  TransCon PTH's clinical holdups de-risk the drug entirely, suggesting a brilliant clinical maneuver.
TransCon PTH is vastly better to Natpara, by a much larger margin than TransCon hGH is to somatragon. I will save the reader the science by identifying only the critical points; the purpose of this section is, after all, to appreciate TransCon PTH's opportune clinical position to a degree the market has not.
The most important feature of a good parathyroid hormone is a test of its replacement ability. The big clinical questions logically follow: is the synthetic PTH providing sufficient calcium just as a natural PTH should? How many patients are taking under 500 mg of calcium every day vs. the normal 2000 mg supplementation? How much calcium ends up in the blood? How much is released in the patients' urine?
To find answers, Ascendis designed a two-part Phase II trial. The first part was purely conducted with safety and dosing as the end-goal, and it spanned over four weeks. Clinically, this was the ""main"" part of the trial. We however believe the second part bears much more significance. Spread over six months, all PTH patients were switched to TransCon PTH and the following endpoints were noted:
Proportion of all subjects with normal blood calcium: 100%
Proportion of all subjects off vitamin D: 100%
Proportion of all subjects taking < 500 mg/day of calcium supplements: 91%
Proportion of all subjects with normal FECa (fractional excretion of calcium): 86%
In the 6-month extension study, 76% of all patients stopped taking pills altogether. 91% of patients met the final two criteria, i.e., no vitamin D and <500 mg of calcium every day. On the contrary, only 43% of Natpara patients hit the two latter criteria, meaning TransCon PTH doubles the efficacy. Ascendis also ran an impressively thorough trial: a decrease in urinary calcium, for instance, provides critical evidence that the newly produced calcium stays in the blood and that the patient receives its entire benefit. Ascendis used ""fractional excretion of calcium"" as a primary endpoint in their trial and demonstrated success in 86% of patients. Natpara, on the other hand, showed urinary calcium excretion increasing over the six-month period – none of the patients were absorbing enough.
The Natpara recall happened in September 2019, and Ascendis promptly enrolled 19 Natpara patients into a Phase II trial. The message was clear: there were 2700 Natpara patients in the US struggling without any treatment, and by demonstrating improvement over Natpara in the ongoing trials, Ascendis could approach the FDA for accelerated approval to address the unmet need. In doing so, it could move submission from 2023 to 2021 and capture the open market. Given the trial's robust clinical design and the unmet need, this strategy had great potential. But seeing as the Phase II trial was not designed as a pivotal trial, there were setbacks. First, with all patients switched over to TransCon PTH, the open-label extension had no control arm. We cannot think of any scenarios in which the FDA approved an uncontrolled trial, so the organization was unlikely to depart from principle for a non-acute disease. Second, TransCon PTH does not have prespecified doses. The clinical trial experts developed an algorithm to decide how much PTH was required for each patient. Because of the external variability this introduced, it may have been unclear whether the trial's success could be attributed to TransCon PTH or to the differences in doses. In hindsight, investors may have played up the accelerated approval possibility; given the points above, Phase II pivotal submission was probably unlikely to happen to begin with.
That being said, with an expanded cohort and stricter endpoints, Ascendis can now orchestrate a fascinating clinical maneuver. By testing the conditions of the Phase III trial, Ascendis has now de-risked TransCon PTH's clinical development program. The Phase III trial will involve 76 patients. Split it 3:1 between treatment and control, and we know that 57 patients will be treated with TransCon PTH. This is lower than the 59 patients enrolled on TransCon PTH in the Phase II enrollment trial; in some ways, the Phase II trial was more confirmatory.
On top of this, Ascendis now knows where to fill in TransCon PTH's Phase II holes. As we have come to learn, the titration algorithm used to dose patients was only a prototype. With a 76% replacement success rate, it worked brilliantly. However, it was highly dependent on prior calcium and vitamin D serum levels, leading many endocrinologists to underdose as a precaution. In Phase III, we believe Ascendis knows the risks much better. They will doubtlessly be looking for a 100% replacement number, and a clinically validated algorithm will be their driving force toward that goal.
  Is TransCon PTH the next Tepezza?
Tepezza is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits IGF-1. Originated by Genmab in the early 2000s, the guiding vision was that IGF-1 was linked to cancer. By the 2010s however, better targets arose and the drug spent years in development hell, from Genmab to Roche, then from Roche to a tiny company called River Vision. Here, scientists were interested in a rare inflammatory condition called thyroid eye disease (TED) which makes the eyes bulge. With no debilitating effects on vision and unclear disease pathology, the incentive to develop a drug for TED is unclear. However, as River Vision floated the option through clinical trials, it found that patients were highly receptive. Moreover, it worked wonderfully. After Tepezza's Phase II results were revealed, River Vision was acquired by Horizon Therapeutics for $145M plus future contingent payments in 2017. Horizon declared Tepezza a likely $250M annual sales opportunity, which was lifted to $750M in early 2020 with large physician education campaigns.
Tepezza hit the shelves in March 2020. Even with the pandemic preventing mandatory in-person infusions, Tepezza became an overnight success. In a single quarter, Horizon racked up $189M in revenues, with ~5,000 patients arriving for their triweekly treatments. Compliance was shockingly perfect. By the end of Q2, peak sales estimates were increased by management to $3B annually. From our own internal analyses, including the impact of ex-US sales, we believe this number may even reach the $4-5B mark – a 15-20x multiple over the first peak sales estimates three years ago.
With Tepezza, Horizon established and executed a working strategy that has formed an important mental model for us ever since. The drug's enormous success had little to do with its safety or efficacy, but it had everything to do with the receptivity of the market. Analysts grossly underestimated the number of physicians and patients interested, considering the hefty >$200,000 annual price tag attached to it. This penetration may increase from ~10% today to ~70%. Market penetration and receptivity are intrinsically linked to the unmet need; where there is significant scope for improvement, Tepezza's example shows that the market will always follow. We believe TransCon PTH will have a very similar trajectory as well. TED and HP share many features: high but non-visible symptoms of discomfort and pain, an inability to work, a similar worldwide population size, and a low competition environment. In both diseases, physician education efforts were critical to the drug's uptake, with bottoms-up marketing efforts launched through concentrated and active patient associations. Finally, both Tepezza and TransCon PTH are extremely effective with >80% of patients meeting all endpoints.
And of course, many of these parallels reflect in the numbers. With an underwhelming commercialization strategy, Shire has still managed to grow patients remarkably from 2000 patients in mid-2018 to 2700 patients in late 2019. This is a 35% increase in patients YoY – but it only represents 3% of the US population. The potential for TAM expansion is huge. Estimating a ~$115,000 price tag on Natpara, the ""half-solution"" was able to bring in an estimated ~$300M a year in the US.
Ascendis is planning on prioritizing TransCon PTH. Even if it scrapes together twice the US market, sales will catapult to $600M a year. Globally, that is already a billion-dollar drug. The potential is clearly massive – but much like Tepezza's case, without physicians even recognizing HP, it is tough to gauge just how large the HP market can be. To give the reader an idea, if Ascendis can get 50% of physicians to prescribe TransCon PTH in the US much like Tepezza, domestic sales may top $5B. Sounds preposterous? Absolutely, even to us– but it hopefully illustrates the sheer magnitude.
One final thought: recall that Ascendis' head of commercialization is Jesper Hoiland. His last company, Radius Health, is one of the three revenue-producing parathyroid endocrinology companies in the world (the others are Amgen and Eli Lilly). Hoiland is intimately familiar with the parathyroid space, and with an HP physician base at Radius already larger than Shire's for Natpara, we have no reason to believe he can't do it again. Altogether, in both scale and revenue ramp, we believe TransCon PTH will be a strong contender to replicate Tepezza's success.
  Early results suggest TransCon CNP could make Ascendis into a leading growth endocrinology company.
Like the rest of Ascendis' endocrine pipeline, the goal behind TransCon CNP is to mimic the body's regulatory function exactly by allowing for continuous secretion of a single protein. Unlike the pipeline, TransCon CNP's Phase I data does not yield a whole lot of insight beyond a well-tolerated profile. With efficacy too early to predict, the clinical trial analyses that benefited TransCon hGH and PTH are relatively inconsequential. Instead, we wanted to direct the attention toward TransCon CNP's largest hurdle and its greatest asset: a six-way competitive battle for the best-in-class title.
But first, some background. Achondroplasia (ACH) or dwarfism is a disease typically associated with short stature. However, its downstream effects can be far more severe. From a symptomatic standpoint, most patients suffer from sleep apnea and respiratory problems. Around a quarter of all patients lose their hearing, and many suffer from spinal problems late into life. ACH patients also only live to around sixty years of age.
The primary scientific basis behind ACH is a mutation in a receptor called FGFR3. In ACH, FGFR3's role is strictly regulatory in nature. When turned off, chondrocytes (or the cells that make up cartilage and lead to bone formation) are formed and expanded. When turned on, the chondrocytes stop growing. Normally, these are held in strict balance by several different stimuli, including the C-natriuretic peptide (CNP) which continually turns off FGFR3 when required and allows chondrocytes to proliferate. In ACH patients however, the FGFR3 receptor has a mutation that hyperactivates to where the body's CNP is insufficient.
To fight this, a number of therapeutic strategies have emerged. One is replicating the FGFR's namesake inhibitor, fibroblast-growth factor or FGF. The risk here however is that FGFR is at the center of several different processes; by injecting more FGF into the body, one risks jeopardizing another important bodily function. The second is building a separate inhibitor to FGFR, much like the efforts undertaken by BridgeBio/Novartis, Pfizer, and Ribomic Inc. While the inhibitor is derisked, the same problems persist to a degree – in fact, ACH was only the third indication chosen by BridgeBio's drug infigratinib (the first two were bile duct cancer and bladder cancer, demonstrating just how ""random"" FGFR receptors can be).
But by far, the ideal approach is replicating the CNP peptide. Because the CNP is an indirect FGFR inhibitor, the core FGF pathways will not be interrupted. In other words, CNP interferes with chondrocyte inhibition and little else. There are two versions of synthetic CNP currently in development: BioMarin's vosoritide and Ascendis' TransCon CNP. Vosoritide is a competent drug. It led to an average height velocity increase of 1.71 cm/year in a cohort of 60 pediatric children against the control group which only had a 0.13 cm/year increase over baseline. Furthermore, quality-of-life metrics were not significantly different between the two groups, reflecting a clear lack of adverse effects and treatment burden.
So why doesn't every company chase CNP? CNP has an extremely low half-life at only 3-5 minutes. By re-engineering the peptide, BioMarin was able to increase this to 30 minutes. This translated to a daily subcutaneous injection which only partially resembles the effect of CNP in the body by adding half an inch. On the other hand, TransCon CNP blows both half-lives away at a whopping 3.5 days, almost 1200 times that of a native CNP. Not only does this turn CNP-based treatment into a weekly regimen, but it also very accurately replicates the body's activity by only allowing CNP to reach a quarter of peak levels. It is tough to lock in the effects of this, but one can logically reason that Phase II trials should bring a pleasant surprise for AHV numbers – well above the mark vosoritide has set.
These make for some exciting developments in the achondroplasia market. But we must set forth some qualifiers. Vosoritide is set to enter the US and UK market over the next few months. TransCon CNP will not reach the market until 2025 or 2026, seeing as the FDA requires a year-long readout for Phase II and a two-year long trial for Phase III. Furthermore, the ACH pipeline is dense; if any of BridgeBio, Ribomic, or Pfizer's products work exceedingly well, it would significantly complicate an already-uphill battle for TransCon CNP. While this does not seem likely from a scientific point of view, clinical efficacy data will be the final arbitrator. Until then, TransCon CNP's advantage seems clear, and it positions the therapy well for commercialization over the next 5 years.
__________________________________________________________________  
Part 3: The Additional Upside
TransCon hGH has a unique edge in adult patients, which will provide a slight revenue boost.
Recall an earlier point about truncal adiposity: hGH is more than just a height booster. It also ensures that the surrounding tissues, fat, and muscle all increase in proportion as well. This latter point is especially critical in the adult GH population, who make up ~10% of the hGH population. Adults do not care to grow taller; they take hGH because certain parts of their body could be either over- or under-developed. To these adults, hGH is more so a necessity than a supplement.
And so, tissue distribution becomes the priority. Unfortunately, this is exactly where modified growth hormones have failed. We have discussed OPKO’s and Novo Nordisk's results above and in both cases, tissue distribution was no better than half of optimal levels. Ascendis, on the other hand, has preclinical and early clinical data suggesting that complete tissue distribution (looking at AUC and Cmax curves). For adult patients, choosing the best GH molecule is far more important than it is for children – and an unmodified GH molecule has better data. That said, adult patients may be more skeptical of the LAGH overall. To account for this, we pull back our revenue estimates to assume only one-third of all adult patients will use an LAGH by 2028. Furthermore, Novo Nordisk will have a two-year head start in commercialization. While it turns the adult hGH race into an uphill battle for Ascendis, we remain confident that Ascendis has the better molecule. As a result, we believe Ascendis will overtake its competition within about five years of its release, translating to ~$100M in additional revenue by 2028.
  TransCon Oncology ushers in a new ""accessory"" product line defined by massive TAM.
When most biotech companies begin unveiling plans in the world of oncology, skepticism matters for two reasons. First, broadly speaking, cancer is tough. Even though the battle against it hinges on a few core principles, executing on these principles can be messy, random, and often misguided as new factors and relationships emerge. But more importantly, companies entering the rat-race are looking for ""easy"" growth through a large TAM. The air-quotes around ""easy"" are purely ironic; of course, as cancer is anything but. Between checkpoint inhibitors Keytruda and Opdivo, however, peak sales are projected to grow to $35B by 2028 – and this is only 50% of the total eligible market. In a market the size of cancer, even a dent is rewarded with billions.
Ascendis understands this and has indicated frequently that TransCon will never compete with the titans. Rather, Ascendis is positioning TransCon Oncology to become an accessory line. This, we believe, makes for a fascinating strategy. Core oncology strategies will always change – PD-1s for the next five years, bispecifics and cell therapies in the years thereafter – but the principles behind an immune response remain the same. Ascendis' first two targets are great examples of this relationship. The TLR7/8 agonist is an immune stimulant that activates T-cells against the tumors. It has two targets – TLR7 and TLR8 – which allow for dual activation of two different immune cell types. While the value proposition is clear as a catalyst for a checkpoint response, its success is less established. For one thing, the sustained release platform for TransCon TLR7/8 is different from its endocrine predecessors. It relies on a localized and intertumoral hydrogel which ""sticks"" to the tumor and secretes drug directly inwards. Because the platform has not been tested in humans yet, we do not think it can be de-risked like the rest of the pipeline. (that said, preclinical mouse results seem to replicate the endocrine pipeline's results perfectly). Furthermore, TransCon TLR7/8's parent drug resiquimod does not share the same success story that the endocrine pipeline does; apart from some promising clinical results in 2015, the case for its efficacy is weak. However, by significantly increasing the efficacy-to-safety ratio via TransCon's localized release, there is a high probability that this could change – and become a template for future TransCon Oncology products. Ascendis filed an IND in December to begin clinical testing.
Ascendis's other cancer play, TransCon IL-2, has massive potential. Cytokine therapies have long been of interest, but rarely have they lived up to the hype. Perhaps TransCon IL-2 end up the same. However, we see several use cases for TransCon IL-2 beyond traditional oncology. New cell therapies – a broad bucket of therapies that inject engineered immune cells directly into the body – have struggled to gain traction without a long-acting version of IL-2 seeing as immune cells die quick. By increasing this half-life from 2.5 hours to 32 hours, TransCon can increase immune cell expansion nearly 10-fold in primates. In doing so, TransCon IL-2 can end up being more than an injectable therapy, but an important manufacturing ingredient. TransCon IL-2's IND will be filed by Q3 2021.
Above all, Ascendis presented data showing that TLR7/8 and IL-2 combined could have synergistic anti-cancer effects, dramatically decreasing tumor size between three or four times more than either could individually. Herein lies the vision for Ascendis's next great era: an entire arsenal of accessory drugs that are both synergistic and structurally de-risked by TransCon. Already, Ascendis has entertained offers for licensing and partnership on the Oncology pipeline, an indicator that commercialization could be tough, but the combination therapies are promising. That said, the lack of human data significantly complicates any proper valuation of this promising pipeline; until then, we will consider the Oncology pipeline mere additional upside.
  TransCon CNP and hGH have additive effects, ushering a new frontier in growth endocrinology.
This is only preclinically validated. However, it may have critical implications for the growth endocrinology over the next decade. The scientific basis behind it is that, like most phenomenon in science, growth biology can be characterized by an elegant pathway. First, GH acts on developing bone cells to trigger differentiation, while concurrently stimulating IGF-1. IGF-1 then expands those bone cells as well as peripheral tissues, creating an intracellular and intercellular environment in which the whole system thrives. Finally, CNP helps the chondrocytes expand at a more rapid pace when growth is especially critical, for instance puberty. When combined, all bottlenecks to growth are removed, leading to overall growth acceleration.
Ascendis tested this theory in mice by injecting both TransCon hGH and TransCon CNP. And as was hypothesized, the results were additive. A combination therapy may be in the works, and from a valuation perspective, both hGH and CNP's markets can expand substantially. Moreover, only three companies have the resources to combine growth hormone with a downstream FGFR inhibitor – Pfizer and Novo Nordisk are the other ones – suggesting a long-lasting oligopoly between the three in growth biology (although this is highly unlikely seeing as several hurdles stand in the way for all three). With preclinical results already validated, Ascendis has the head-start. Where the journey goes from here, it will be exciting to see.
  Ascendis's auto-injector's 4mm needle boosts TransCon's value proposition.
Four millimeters, for reference, is 5/32 of an inch, about the width of three grains of rice. The current standard (at least for hGH) is double that at eight millimeters. We were surprised to realize that many clinicians ranked this difference lowest in their decision-making criteria; based on the patient feedback Ascendis received, we think the needle is one of those see-it-to-believe-it aspects of a good injection. There are both physiological and psychological factors that back this. From a physiological perspective, longer needles are wrought with adverse event issues. Notice the adverse event profiles between TransCon hGH and somatrogon vary significantly. The X-factor is injection-site pain: as 39% of all weekly somatragon patients indicated, a deeper injection that pierces into your muscle correlates with higher pain and worse injection reactions. On the psychological side, after spending years on a longer needle, it is much easier to appreciate a smaller one. At half the length, the 4-mm needle quickly and deliberately pricks the subcutaneous layer. For children, this decreases the age at which they can self-inject. For parents, it reduces the stress. In fact, we spoke about how most innovation in hGH was exclusively limited to the auto-injector in the past. This is as radical an innovation to the auto-injector as could ever happen.
Now let us broaden this to the whole of TransCon. Endocrinology is a field fundamentally tied to the injection; from insulin to growth hormone to PTH, hormones must be deposited directly into the bloodstream. Ascendis is trying to build a leading endocrinology company, and the needle is just another shot on goal. Will it contribute any monetary value? Probably not, apart from better compliance. However, it does help Ascendis garner brand value as a company with optimized home subcutaneous capabilities across stakeholders, and the value of this stickiness cannot be forgotten.
__________________________________________________________________ 
Part 4: Valuation
Before touching on valuation, we want to comment on potential dilution going forward. Having raised capital in July 2020, Ascendis has just under $1B in cash on hand. With a burn rate of $362M over the last twelve months and large-scale commercial launches for their three endocrinology pipeline products in 2021, 2023, and 2025, Ascendis is unlikely to raise more capital over the next two years. Additional capital raises will depend on the performance of the pipeline products below.
  TransCon hGH can reap $1.2 billion in sales by the time LAGHs take over in 2027.
The way we see it, there is simply no reason for physicians to use daily growth hormones when LAGHs exist, irrespective of whether the revenues go to OPKO or Ascendis. But to be conservative, we temper down any lofty assumptions about any revenue acceleration. We project that LAGH use will broadly increase from 8% in 2021 to ~50% in 2027. This may seem overcautious (and it probably is), but considering global physicians are wary of new biological technologies, international uptake may be the rate-limiting factor. In terms of the patient population using hGHs, we believe the market is already established with a CAGR of 2.4% - by 2029, over 150,000 patients worldwide will be on some form of hGH and ~80,000 should be on LAGHs.
GH therapy works on a four-year cycle. Therefore, if 6400 patients are prescribed on LAGHs in Year 1, those 6400 patients will carry over to Year 2, Year 3, and Year 4 before they drop off therapy. Such patient aggregation creates a gradual revenue boost for Ascendis; if only 6400 patients start LAGH therapy each year, there will be over 25,000 patients on therapy by the end of Year 4. Of course, this is misleading; the number should be closer to 60,000 seeing as more patients choose LAGHs over daily GHs every year. If the new number of patients arriving in Year 5 outweighs the number of Year 1 patients who leave, the overall TransCon hGH population – and therefore, TransCon hGH revenues – should continue to grow.
This four-year cycle anchors the model. Because of it, ""switch patients"" do not factor into revenues after 2025; most after that point either start on TransCon hGH or decide to stay their course with daily GH. In fact, such ""switch patients"" only matter through the first two years ($134M and $107M sales respectively). Furthermore, we project Ascendis and OPKO will compete for the patient population, and following our argument above, we project TransCon hGH will win in a roughly 60-40 proportion. Even after Novo Nordisk enters the landscape, assuming a ~$32,000 price tag, we believe TransCon hGH can reach $1B in annual sales by 2026. In fact, even if these tides are flipped and the proportion goes 40-60, Ascendis can record $1B annual sales before 2030. Any way one dices this, Ascendis should have a blockbuster drug.
  TransCon PTH is a blockbuster drug with very high upside.
We already talked at length about TransCon PTH's valuation potential (see to the Tepezza vs. TransCon PTH from earlier), but this brief section should concretely lay down our assumptions. We assume domestic pricing in line with Natpara (a premium is likely but not accounted for in our valuation) at $115,050 annually per patient. We also assume a total US hypoparathyroidism prevalence of 80,000, as well as an international prevalence at ~150,000 patients. These numbers are likely to be much higher, even as high as 120,000 patients in the US and 400,000 worldwide because of the undercounting. Our estimates are truly conservative. We assume patient penetration by 2029 will be ~15% of the US HP population, with a steady revenue ramp growing from 6% penetration in 2023. It translates to ~$2B in global sales as of 2029, which once again could even be conservative. Finally, we assume TransCon PTH will win up to 86% of all PTH users given its full-replacement therapy status and a lack of competition.
Of course, it all comes down to market penetration. The floor for penetration is Natpara's performance, and Natpara alone has covered 3% of the US population with a nearly 30% annual increase in patients over the last five years. If the market penetration stagnates in the US at 5%, global revenues may come out to ~$600M annually. This effectively sets a floor on Ascendis' valuation at ~$5-6B. On the flip side, if domestic market penetration soars to 30%, PTH's net present value should come closer to $20-25B assuming annual peak sales of ~$3.6B. At 50% penetration, this is $35B. The upside for a full-replacement therapy is enormous yet uncertain, and it will be fascinating to watch just how TransCon PTH's launch pans out.
  While TransCon CNP is not first-in-class, it scientifically leads a broad market.
Unlike the first two molecules, TransCon CNP is not a first-in-class play. Yet it makes for a great investment case, particularly in its similarities to TransCon hGH. It turns vosoritide's daily dosing regimen into a weekly one, and it can use sustained release to improve height efficacy. Furthermore, assuming TransCon hGH truly hits its stride by 2025, there will be enough growth-focused endocrinologists integrated into Ascendis' physician networks to quickly accelerate TransCon CNP's rollout.
Considering the lack of efficacy data however, we choose to stay conservative with our TransCon CNP projections. We first consider the low childhood population prevalence, using BioMarin's estimation of 22,000 patients as a base growing at a 4% CAGR. We do not think all patients will want treatment, especially when it only confers a few centimeters of height. By 2029, with our fingers crossed for more effective drugs, we believe ~38% of all patients will want treatment. At a base price of $120,000 growing at 4% YoY, this implies the ACH market should grow to ~$1.9B by the start of 2030. If Ascendis captures 30% of this market, it should be able to secure just under $600M in sales by that point. But this is contingent on the efficacy readouts in Q3 2021. We adjust with a probability of success at 60% -- high for a Phase II drug, but not unrealistic given TransCon's structural derisking. Should Phase II trials succeed, we will consider marking this number up to 85%. While TransCon CNP may not have the clear blockbuster potential of its two predecessors, we believe it will generate a steady revenue stream for Ascendis as it develops the oncology pipeline in the latter half of the 2020s.
  DCF Analysis
We wanted a ballpark estimate of Ascendis's current value, and so we conducted a sum-of-the-parts analysis. We estimate that TransCon hGH, TransCon PTH, and TransCon CNP can achieve probability-adjusted revenues of $2B, $1.8B, and $300M respectively by 2029, adding up to a total of $4.2B. Please note that none of these estimates are reflective of peak sales; with TransCon PTH and CNP especially, we expect peak sales to increase even further.
We assume gross margins will come out to ~90%, in line with the typical high-margin small molecule company. For R&D expenses, we used a historical 'percentage of cash' scheme, which came out to roughly 30%. Historical SG&A by cash margins came to ~8%. Ascendis's depreciation costs are largely expensed in R&D and SG&A, while working capital changes and capital expenditures are negligible. Ascendis also only has ~$40M in debt. As a result, we decided to zero out the interest line items. This may be controversial with some folks, but we must remind you: a) a specialty biopharma company is rarely affected by any of those line items and b) we were only looking for a ballpark estimate. Using a calculated WACC of 10.90% and an industry-standard terminal growth rate at 2%, we arrived at a valuation of $12.6B, around $236 a share. This marks a 59% upside to current prices, with TransCon Oncology providing ample additional upside for the future pipeline.
Once again, we do not believe a DCF is an accurate measure for Ascendis's – or frankly, any true platform company's – future value. If Mikkelsen and Ascendis execute in a manner consistent with the last fifteen years, we should anticipate a dozen more molecules over the next fifteen. Sum-of-the-parts DCFs, even with an artificially boosted terminal growth rate, cannot do this justice. Instead, we must turn to a different method.

  Comps Analysis
For our preferred valuation method, we wanted to highlight the impact of both Ascendis's current pipeline and its future one. To do so, we performed a simple EV/Revenue multiples analysis. We used the YE2020 revenues for all but Galapagos, who were hit with a CRL in 2020 (we used 2019 EV and revenue instead). The comparable companies we used were all commercial biopharma firms. Our original intention was to use only platform companies in this analysis; however, the uniqueness of Ascendis's platform quickly became clear. Aside from Seagen, there are no commercial biopharmas with 3+ years of revenues and a platform at its core. Instead, we decided to use a mix of semi-platform (highlighted in light blue) and high-productivity companies as comps . In doing so, we wanted to replicate the impact of a platform to construct an accurate measure of market perception.
Our ultimate outcome was a 5-year and 7-year IRR. The reason we stretched both out so much is because we wanted to come as close to peak sales as possible, just as most of our comparable companies had. Using the revenue projections above and a median multiple of 8.54x, we arrived at a 5-year IRR of 17% and a 7-year IRR of 18%. As a platform company, we believe this underscores what Ascendis can accomplish. With three derisked pipelines in commercialization, development, and discovery, the returns we project are testament to TransCon's unique productivity.
  With TransCon, we believe Ascendis is the rare biotech company with decades of progress ahead.
We mentioned risk as one disincentive for investors looking to diversify into the life sciences. A second that we omitted was TAM. Most biotech companies place a ceiling on their TAMs even before they begin. It is their contract with the world, an unspoken recognition of the fact that the number of sickle cell disease or wet AMD patients will never magically increase. Whatever the respective TAM is, rarely does opportunity for growth exist beyond it.
Every so often however, some young biotech will come along and break this rule. The company might prove that a TAM is much bigger than the world expects. Or it might aggressively pursue different avenues, marginally increasing the TAM with each one. Ascendis does both. Through TransCon hGH and PTH, management sought out the rare opportunities where a product can increase its own market, simply by working better than the world expects. And with TransCon CNP and Oncology, Ascendis showcases its ability to produce high-TAM plays quickly and strategically. Combine the two, and the company stands to change the paradigm for commercial biotech.

2007-12-17,elan19,RAIL,FreightCar America,https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/FreightCar_America/9582729889,396000000.0,33.5,"Description
FreightCar America is a slow growing coal car manufacturer with wildly cyclical revenues and earnings. Both the business and the stock are well into the down portion of the current cycle. I believe this stock is worth somewhere between $40 and $66 base case, and possibly more if numerous plans for coal plant construction truly result in many new coal plants coming on line in the next few years.
As detailed below, RAIL’s annual shipments over the next decade will be 12,300 cars per year, plus or minus 2,000. This translates into normalized annual earnings in the range of $3.25 to $6.50 (2005 is an example of a typical year). All this conservatively assumes so many cancellations or delays of announced coal plant construction projects that coal plant construction merely keeps up with population growth. Following is a link to a report which justifies taking a conservative approach towards new coal plant announcements:
http://www.netl.doe.gov/coal/refshelf/ncp.pdf
If you assign a slow growth P/E of 8 to these earnings and combine that with $14/share cash, the stock should trade between $40 and $66 once backlog begins to show 2 or 3 quarters of growth. The recovery to average or above average volumes could take anywhere from 1 to 5 years, so the annualized return on this investment will depend on how long it takes for this to happen. Assuming typical market behavior, the stock price will rise at least to the middle of this range after 2 or 3 quarters of backlog growth.
It’s hard to peg an exact downside for this stock as cyclical stocks can get awfully cheap, but the company currently has $14/share in cash.
This name was written up once before on VIC so I will not repeat the excellent background information included within that report which discusses the industry, RAIL’s strong position within that industry, and prospects for expanded coal production. My biggest numerical difference is the assumed replacement cycle – I chose to use 30 years instead of 25, as the presentation currently on the website notes a 3% replacement rate and the S-1 from a few years ago states 25-30 years as typical. My more conservative assumption combined with a different methodology leads to the lower 12,300/year freight car delivery average, as follows:
(See p.21 of presentation on RAIL website, “U.S. Coal Car age profile.”)
Assume all coal cars aged 31-50 are replaced (48k cars)
Assume 1/3 to 1/2 of cars aged 20-30 are replaced (30k to 45k cars)
Assume 1% to 2% annual growth in total coal cars (25k to 50k cars)
Total over next decade: 103k to 143k cars (10.3k to 14.3k per year)
Though RAIL ships other kinds of cars as well, coal car deliveries (of which RAIL ships 80%) serve as a good approximation for RAIL’s total deliveries each year, if you look back a number of years.
Railcar manufacturing is a high fixed cost business. My crude model (which roughly conforms to actual results of the past 10 quarters) shows breakeven operating earnings at approximately 6,000 cars per year, and EPS of $3.25 for a 10,300 shipment year, and $6.50 for a 14,300 shipment year, assuming no more buybacks. Note that the breakeven point is higher than from several years ago, because the company has the extra costs of being public (SG&A), and because of a union settlement detailed in the S-1 (COGS). Also note that the company has three plants, one with substantially higher variable costs. At a run rate beyond 7,000 railcars per year or so, the company must produce out of its more costly Johnstown plant.
As described in the last write-up, the competitive landscape is fairly stable despite various attempts by RAIL and its competitors to extend product lines and/or services. So despite the big ups and downs for orders over several years time, this is really a very predictable business when one thinks in terms of the next decade, as the business grows too slowly to attract new entrants. However, there are a few additional opportunities and risks to consider with this business:
Opportunities
Many utilities have an intention to build new coal-fired plants, in conjunction with track capacity expansion in the Powder River Basin due for completion in 2009 (portions of the expansion have been completed already). Assuming this all comes to fruition, new coal cars will need to be built and the numbers described above are significantly understated. U.S. currently has 313GW of capacity from coal plants and it seems likely that this will be increased by at least 1%/year for the next few years, and possibly higher than 2%/year. See prior VIC report on RAIL for more detail, as well as the report referenced by this link again provided:
http://www.netl.doe.gov/coal/refshelf/ncp.pdf
The company is currently negotiating with the union for the Johnstown plant. Production has dropped drastically (and may soon be zero) at this plant, so the company has extra leverage in the negotiations. At some point, the union will make concessions or the company will close the plant altogether and outsource production to a less expensive manufacturer. Last CC, management indicated that an announcement on this should come soon.
Rail legislation (H.R. 2116) has been introduced (but not yet debated) which promotes expansion of rail capacity. Nothing in the bill has a direct impact on RAIL, that I can see, but it seems possible that tax breaks beneficial to RAIL could be added to the bill as it winds its way through congress.
The company is already buying back stock – obviously the lower the stock price, the greater the benefit of these buybacks.
Risks

Railroads have been increasing efficiency over the past few years, meaning fewer cars are needed to move the same amount of coal. For example, BNSF increased railcar velocity by 9% in 2006, the equivalent of adding 7,600 railcars to their fleet, and expects further improvement in 2007. Eventually, a plateau will be reached beyond which further efficiency gains are very hard to attain, but I’m not sure when that point is. On the other hand, if coal cars are spending a greater percentage each year in transit, then presumably they will wear out faster which could lead to a shorter average life.
The competition appears to be chipping away a little bit at RAIL’s market share of late. Not sure if this is just quarterly fluctuation or the beginning of a long-term trend.
The coal industry is often a big target of various types of federal or state legislation and local resistance, due to carbon emissions and other forms of pollution. Federal legislation is not a risk in the near term as two major pieces of legislation favorable to coal are about to pass: The Global Warming bill (if passed) will award over 300 billion dollars worth of auction proceeds to the coal industry for efforts associated with carbon sequestration (which does not yet exist) and the Energy bill contains no provisions hurting the coal industry. Neither bill contains any provisions promoting any form of renewable energy. However, the tide could easily turn under a new congress and/or presidential administration in 2009, and many states/locales take matters into their own hands, which causes delay or in some cases cancellation of new coal plants.
The company has frequently discussed rail-related acquisition possibilities for the last two years. Discussion for the last two quarters has centered on India. While the fact that the company is taking a long time to make an acquisition is a good sign, there is always the possibility that they will convert cash into a disastrous acquisition.
There are several factors that can cause demand for coal to slump. If some or all of these factors came into play for several years in a row, then this would lead to a multi-year slump for orders of new coal cars. 92% of coal use in the U.S. is for electricity generation and the amount of electricity needed is driven by growth in the economy and weather (moderate weather means less electricity needed). Coal competes with other energy sources – it is currently by far the most economical but that could change, especially if natural gas prices stayed low for many years.
The short term risk is that shipments fall below 1,500 units per quarter, which causes EPS to go negative. Consensus estimates for next couple quarters seem high to me, and the shares may go down in reaction to the company missing earnings estimates. In other words – the bottom for this stock might be a lower price 1-2 quarters from now.

2010-02-14,sparky371,NOG,NORTHERN OIL & GAS INC,https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/NORTHERN_OIL_and_GAS_INC/6206474430,507000000.0,12.36,"Description
 Northern Oil and Gas is an intriguing way to play the Williston Basin Bakken/Three Forks play. The Williston Basin Bakken has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the advancements in the horizontal drilling multi-stage fraccing technique. NOG has properties in the heart of the play (adjacent to EOG's spectacular Parshall field) in Mountrail County. And, now, with BEXP having ""cracked the code"" on their acreage, the size of footprint for economic completions has extended to the west side of Williams and Mckenzie counties. 
What is unique about NOG is that it is based on the non-operator model. When an operator wants to drill on land they've leased, they apply to the Industrial Commission to create a drilling block. These are usually 640 acre drill sections, tho they can be as large ast 1280 acres or as small as 320 acres. They rarely control all the land in the drill block; Other owners are entitled to participate pro rata according to percentage of acreage held. The operator thus sends out AFE's (Authority For Expenditures) to the minority lease/land holders, notifying them of their pro rata share of the upcoming costs to drill. These minority holders must then quickly respond. If they pay the operator for their share of the costs, they retain their rights to their pro rata share of the oil produced. If not, then the operator gets to keep an amount of oil equal to three times his costs before the minority holder starts getting his share. Often, a local landowner does not have the money or risk-tolerance to invest along with the operator. 
That's where NOG comes in. NOG's CEO, Michael Reger, is the 4th generation of oil and gas men from the Williston Basin of MT and ND in his family. He knows the properties, the laws, and often the people. NOG is the only entity that is capable of fielding a phone call from a local and getting a check to the operator in time to preserve the pro rata rights. Large operators don't want to buy out local minority interests. Too cumbersome. Too potentially litigious. Additionally, there is intense competition between the large operators. Often times one will decide to drill and another will have a small piece on the drilling unit. They will sell this to NOG so as to not be involved in another operator's well. In this manner, NOG has accumulated about 85,000 (net) acres in the Bakken/Three Forks play. They just recently raised $60 million to continue to accumulate acreage and pay for drilling expenses. Another advantage of the non-operator model is that they get a free ride on the operators non-drilling expenses, such as geologic, geophysical, engineering, legal, accounting, etc. Perhaps the most critical advantage of NOG's model is that they picked up their leaseholds, which expire after five years if not drilled, after the big operators acquired theirs. Thus, the operators are much more incented to drill and NOG is highly unlikely to lose their leaseholds. Most NOG leaseholds do not expire until 2H2012 and it is believed that 80-100% of their acreage will be HBP by then. Once the properties are producing, the leases cannot expire, and given the long tail nature of the horizontal drilling, these wells are estimated to last 40 years or more. With the near-universal success of drilling on the Williston Bakken, it is highly likely that all the large operators will secure their leaseholds by drilling in the next 18-24 months. NOG has land positions in many different operators' fields. Thus, they are not tied to the fortunes of any one or two operators.
 After that, the fun likely begins. There are two more ways in which the value of these properties is likely to jump dramatically. One is likely downspacing of the wells. Each unit only needs one well to hold it by production, which as we just discussed will happen soon. It is believed that the radius that the fraccing drains is not that great, which, with the favorable IP's is amazing. Thus, it is highly likely that the operators will aggressively downspace wells in each unit to fully exploit the resource. It is currently expected that your typical 640acre unit will ultimately have four wells on it. This is just to tap the Bakken. Underneath the Bakken is another layer known as the Three Forks. It is thought that TFS will be as productive, if not more productive than the Middle Bakken. It is believed likely that the TFS will also be amenable to downspacing. Thus, each drilling unit could potentially have a total of 8 wells on it. 
Valuation: It is currently expected that the EUR of the wells will average 500,000 bbls. Currently, NOG has 85,000 net acres. At 640 acres per drilling unit, that means 130 net (primary) wells, or 65million bbls of oil by the end of 2011. There are 41million shares out; or about 1 ½ bbls per shr using these (admittedly rough) numbers. Pick a cost per barrel, an oil price, a discount rate (tho production will be front-loaded), do the math and you can see the potential here. Again, these are the expectations for the FIRST well on each drilling unit. Cost for drilling keep coming down and economics get better as more stages are fracced. NOG just participated (23% WI) in a well that included 36 fraccing stages and IP'd an incredible 2700boe/d, with Slawson as the operator. 
NOG currently has $45M in cash, no debt, and will likely have $25-50M in borrowing base after the 2009 re-determination. As PDP's go up, the borrowing base will go up if necessary. The biggest risk to NOG is a sharp decline in oil prices. The Bakken currently works down to $30 or $40/bbl. NOG has hedged 20% of its anticipated 2010 production at $78. Enbridge has recently added pipe to facilitate oil export. EOG uses the pipeline as well as railcars to Cushing.

Vulcan International is a holding company that is comprised of marketable securities, real estate, an over-funded pension plan and two small operating businesses. The bulk of the value is concentrated in marketable securities and real estate assets. Based on a sum of the parts valuation, as described below, it is worth approximately $94 per share on gross asset value or $60 per share on an after tax basis to shareholders. These are premiums of about 50% – 130% over the current share price. Book value stands at $54.85 per share. Management controls approximately 42% of the outstanding shares and the chairman receives $300,000 per year.

1. Securities – At September 30, 2001, Vulcan owned equities with a market capitalization of $79.3MM consisting of shares in AT&T and all of its spin-offs and two unnamed financial institutions in the Ohio area. The cost basis of these holdings is $6.3MM. They write covered calls against the positions and receive annual dividends to the tune of $2.2MM per year.
2. Real Estate – Vulcan owns 8 floors of the Cincinnati Club Building in downtown Cincinnati with 88,000 gross rentable sq. ft. and 56,000 of usable sq. ft. The company occupies the top floor and rents out the other 7. Market rents in this building are currently $10 –14 per sq. ft. depending on floor and requested tenant improvements. Minimum rental for 2002 is $318,827 excluding the top floor. A ballpark valuation assuming the top floor is rented out at market would be $4MM assuming the top floor rents out at $14/ft, a cash flow of $320,000 and a cap rate of 8%. If they could bring the remaining floors to market rents the building could be worth up to $8MM. The building was renovated in 1987 and is in good condition.
3. Timberland – The Company owns 14,000 acres of timberland in the upper peninsula of Michigan. It is difficult to place a distinct value per acre. We have used a range of $200 to $1,000 per acre and for valuation purposes used an arbitrary number of $500 per acre to come up with a $7MM value for the land.
4. Bowling Pins – a 50% joint venture with Brunswick Bowling that generates about $1.2MM in EBITDA in an environment where the largest bowling alley operator is just about to emerge from bankruptcy. A 5x EBITDA multiple at 50% ownership gives a $3MM value to Vulcan.
5. Foam Rubber Products – Manufacturers rubber and foam for inserts into shoes (US only) and other undisclosed uses. A lousy business that produces negative cash flow. However, the Company owns its 272,000 sq. ft. manufacturing facility outright and has assets of about $4MM. We give this a nominal value of about $3MM assuming a liquidation of the assets and real estate for 75 cents on the dollar.
6. Over-funded pension plan – The Company has an over funded plan to the tune of $5.2MM as of September 2001.
7. Cash and debt – At quarter end the Company had cash of $1.4MM and debt of $.565MM.

The sum is as follows: Securities $79.3MM, Real Estate $4MM, Timberland $7MM, Foam rubber $3MM, Bowling Pins $3MM, Pension Plan $5.2MM and net cash .9MM for a total of $102MM.

There are 1,085,219 shares outstanding. Taking the total asset and dividing by the number of shares gets us to the $94 total liquidation value. Using a tax rate of 40% and subtracting cost basis (gains of $73MM for securities, $10MM for real estate/timberland and other of $11MM), yields after tax corporate proceeds of approximately $65MM or $60 per share.
Catalyst
An investor group led by Barington Companies filed a 13D in October of 2001 with a stake slightly above 5%. Part of this group is Musicmaker.com, which has cash of $9MM and a large NOL. Barington gained control of Musicmaker by attacking the company legally and forcing it to realize shareholder value. Theoretically, Musicmaker could buy Vulcan and utilize its NOL to shield most of the deferred gains in Vulcan’s assets. It should be able to pay a premium to the after-tax value of $65MM, which should be an incentive for the insiders to sell out.

I recommend selling short shares of CD Projekt (CDR). The stock’s valuation is simply too expensive for a company whose business model is more akin to a traditional cyclical than many of its video game peers. CDR is likely to face declining earnings over the next 5 years as it attempts to recover the debacle of its most recent release, Cyberpunk 2077.  Shares are already down 60% from their December high, but I believe there to be another 50% downside from here as investors begin to recognize how low probability of a successful recovery really is.  The following is derived from the analysis of company filings and transcripts as well as conversations with industry insiders and experts.
  Executive Summary
  Cyberpunk 2077’s failure to gain traction with players should significantly impact CDR’s earnings over the next 5 years. At a time when the company should be rolling outplanned DLC releases and focusing on its next major title, it is instead patching never-ending issues in attempt to reinvigorate interest from a notoriously fickle gaming community that has seemingly moved on.
Even the most successful games in Cyberpunk’s genre of single player story-driven games have experienced severe declines in units sold in the years following their release. This is a feature of the genre not a bug, yet consensus numbers do not appear to fully reflect the company’s historical earnings trough in between launches.
Recent video game history is littered with examples of single player story-driven games that failed to translate initial success to online multiplayer, and it is unlikely Cyberpunk will be any different. Furthermore, management has already begun to backtrack on its original plans, putting further doubt on whether it will ever deliver a multiplayer expansion.
The bull case appears to be focused on hoping that several upcoming catalysts might revive interest in the game. However, there are reasons to be believe that each of these is quite unlikely to have any significant financial impact that will justify CDR’s lofty valuation.
CDR’s valuation is at a significant premium to its AAA video game peers that possess more recurring revenue and less volatile business models.
  Company Overview
  CD Projekt is a AAA video game developer headquartered and listed in Poland. With a $4.3bn market cap it is the 14th largest listed company on the Warsaw stock exchange by market cap and the 19th largest pureplay listed video game developer globally. Over the years the company has built a reputation as one of the prominent AAA developers of single player story-driven games. Netflix subscribers will recognize the popular franchise, The Witcher, which has sold over 50 million units across three games since the first launched in 2007. The first two Witcher games were highly rated (81 and 88 on Metacritic) and have combined to sell ~20mn units since the first game was released in 2007. But The Witcher 3 is where the company really built its reputation as the game is generally acknowledged as one of the best released on the last generation consoles (Xbox One, PS4). Since its 2015 launch The Witcher 3 has sold over 30mn units with nearly half of these coming following the release of the Netflix series in late 2019.
  Beyond the three main Witcher games, CDR has developed a few different mobile games based on The Witcher. These games have had varying levels of success with volatile results, but conservatively generate ~$25mn per quarter for the company.
  It is important to note that while most AAA game studios typically juggle many franchises and multiple releases each year, CDR is a “one game at a time” studio, averaging 4-5 years between releases. With the critical and financial success of The Witcher 3 as well as some aggressive marketing and promises, CDR’s most recent game, Cyberpunk 2077, was one of the most anticipated games of all-time. Much has been written about what went wrong (good summary by The New York Times here) but what matters here is that the launch was one of the biggest flops in video game history. CDR delivered a game so riddled with bugs that Sony actually removed it from the PlayStation Store for six months. Despite the issues, the game still sold well initially with over 13mn copies sold in its first month (many of which were pre-orders), but now copies can be found regularly on Amazon or GameStop at up to 50% discounts. This has thrown a wrench in CDR’s plans to rollout years’ worth of additional content meant to stretch the life of the game. Instead, it has spent the last eight months trying to fix all the bugs before notoriously fickle gamers have entirely moved on.
  Investment thesis:
  AAA single player games have short life cycles. Beneath the headlines and initial bugs (which will eventually be fixed) Cyberpunk 2077 is not a terrible game. It has an engaging story (starring an animated Keanu Reeves) and is generally a fun single player shooter. It compares favorably to other notable AAA single-player story-driven games like those of Rockstar’s GTA and Red Dead Redemption franchises or ZeniMax’s Fallout and Elder Scrolls franchises. These games are the pinnacle of the single player story-driven genre, and each of the most recent games in each franchise are considered critical and financial successes. The chart below shows how each these games performed in the years following its release (in millions of units). Note that Elder Scrolls and Fallout are excluded from the chart as ZeniMax has not shared unit information consistently since the developer was private until its recent acquisition by Microsoft.
  As shown, even the upper echelon of AAA single player story-driven games experienced a dramatic decline in sales volumes in the years following their launch. Many of these games won awards and launched additional DLC (downloadable content) that extended their lives for years. Even so, units sold were down 50%+ in the years following their release. Revenues likely fared even worse as the units sold in Years 2+ are almost always at discounted prices making the dollar-based sales declines even greater than shown above.
  This cliff is a characteristic of the single player story-driven genre. These games do not hold much replay value once the player has completed them and it creates a boom-and-bust cycle for the companies that develop them. The pursuit of more predictable revenue streams is a key theme in the industry and has contributed to the rise in popularity of the live-service online multiplayer genre of games have resonated with players in recent years like. This is important to understand because it is the reason why GTA 5 is somewhat of an outlier on the chart above. Shortly after the release of GTA 5, Rockstar introduced a multiplayer expansion to the game called GTA Online that allowed players to play online with their friends in a similar manner to live-service online multiplayer games like Fortnite and PUBG. The addition of GTA Online has helped Rockstar to continue to sell tens of millions of copies of GTA 5 eight years after its release and introduce additional monetization methods such as microtransactions.
  Speaking of online multiplayer… Part of the hype around Cyberpunk 2077 was the expectation of a GTA-esque online multiplayer expansion. Management enabled this narrative by frequently mentioning its intention to follow the GTA playbook and launch an online multiplayer mode within the first year or two after the single-player release.  However, due to all the initial issues, management delayed and then backtracked on its original multiplayer plans for multiplayer.
  November 2020 (pre-Cyberpunk release) - It’s a separate dedicated production, a big production,” said CD Projekt Red’s CEO regarding Cyberpunk’s multiplayer. “And we plan — we think about it as a standalone product. Obviously, it’s not entirely standalone as it comes from the universe of Cyberpunk and is very much related to the concept of single-player Cyberpunk…. “It’s another independent production and an independent team of people works on it. I said already we are not focusing right now on talking too much about other future products, products that are to be released after Cyberpunk. So please be with us in the first quarter of next year when we plan to share some strategy update. And I believe Cyberpunk multiplayer will be possible.”
  March 2021(post-Cyberpunk release) - “Previously, we hinted that our next AAA would be a multiplayer Cyberpunk game, but we have decided to reconsider this plan,” Kiciński said. “Given our new, more systematic and agile approach, instead of primarily focusing on one big online experience or game, we are focusing on bringing online into all of our franchises one day.”
  To me this sounds like Cyberpunk 2077 may never receive the multiplayer expansion that was originally envisioned. But even if CDR does manage to eventually deliver a multiplayer expansion, it would by no means be a guaranteed success. With GTA 5 as the exception, no other AAA single player story-driven game has been able to translate its single player success to multiplayer. The list of recent multiplayer failures by AAA studios that are known for quality single player story-driven player is extensive. Over just the last four years we have seen failures from many of the top studios in the genre such as Bioware’s Anthem, ZeniMax’s Fallout 76  and Elder Scrolls Online. Even Rockstar could not replicate its own success with Red Dead Online.
  So, what’s the bull case? The bull case hinges on CDR’s ability to revive gamer interest in Cyberpunk following several upcoming catalysts that I believe are unlikely to bring gamers back:
  1.     Bulls point to Cyberpunk’s return to the PlayStation Store in June after which it was the bestselling PS4 game of the month. However, this is a misleading data point. For starters, Sony launched its next gen console, the PS5, in November 2020. This implies that most new games are for the PS5 not the PS4. The names below Cyberpunk on the top selling list are a hodgepodge of popular older games that are all available at a discount (GTA 5, Minecraft, Fortnite). We should note that Cyberpunk itself is also discounted on the PS store at $49.99 (from $59.99). But more importantly, Cyberpunk was missing from July’s top sellers list just a month later.
2.     Bulls will also point to this Fall’s release of the next gen PS5 and Xbox Series X versions of Cyberpunk. However, this is a misleading catalyst that is unlikely to have much of a financial impact as players that purchased the game on previous generation consoles can download the next gen version for free. Of course, there may be a small segment of gamers that have held off purchasing the game until the next gen release, but the majority of CDR’s target market has likely already purchased the game.
3.     Similarly, CDR is releasing an updated version of The Witcher 3 for the next gen consoles. But like Cyberpunk, owners of the last gen version can download the new version for free. It’s unlikely this release will drive many incremental purchases of the six-year-old game.
4.     Some bulls still seem to be hanging on the potential for a multiplayer release in 2022 or 2023. I have addressed this unlikelihood above.
5.     A Cyberpunk anime series on Netflix is scheduled for release in 2022. Admittedly, this one has the potential to drive further sales of the game. The Witcher 3 saw a ~60% y/y increase in units sold following the Netflix series of The Witcher, and it could be a potential risk if the show is popular. However, one key difference is that Netflix’s The Witcher is a live action series, while the upcoming Cyberpunk series is an anime cartoon that may only appeal to a smaller audience than The Witcher did.
    Valuation & Financials
    The table above compares CDR’s valuation (on consensus estimates) with the publicly traded game developers that compete with CDR in the AAA single player story-driven genre of games.  At first glance CDR’s premium isn’t too great compared to TTWO, but TTWO derives a greater percentage of its sales from “recurring” revenue from its annual 2K franchises (mainly NBA2K) and GTA Online, which CDR is lacking. The 2K franchises have a built-in fan base that are highly likely to purchase the new game each year, while GTA Online is a live service game relying on microtransactions from a massive player base. Also notable is that Finnish developer Remedy trades at an even greater premium than CDR. However, the two companies’ outlooks are very different. It’s true that Remedy was once a single project studio like CDR, but that is no longer the case as the developer has undergone a multiyear transition to a multiple project model, which is a major part of the narrative behind the stock’s ~6x run over the last three years. It currently has 4+ projects in development (and a partnership with Tencent) that are expected to drive significant annual revenue and earnings growth for the foreseeable future.
  If we assume that Cyberpunk follows the same volume trends as the comparisons in the earlier chart, CDR will sell ~5mn copies annually over the next four years. ASPs can be hard to predict, especially given the discounts the game is already seeing, but let’s assume an average retail price of $40 in 2021 and $30 in 2022-2024 (vs. $49.99 on digital stores and under $30 at retailers like Amazon/GameStop currently). As the developer and publisher CDR captures ~60% of the sales from each unit with the rest divided among the distributor, retailer, and platform. This means $24 per unit in revenue to CDR in 2021 and $18 in 2022-2024. Under these assumptions CDR’s revenue from Cyberpunk would be ~$120mn in 2021 and ~$90mn per year in 2022-2024. Conservatively throw in ~$100mn in annual revenue from the portfolio of mobile games, and we get 2021 revenue of $220mn and 2022-24 annual revenues of $190mn. A 40% net margin (averaged 39% through The Witcher 3 cycle) gets us $88mn in earnings for 2021 and $76mn annually from 2022-2024; implying that CDR is trading at 51x P/E as it enters a downcycle.
  Given the cyclical nature of the business, it may also be fair to value the company off an estimate of normalized earnings. If we average the earnings estimates above with the peak Cyberpunk sales of 2020 (shown above) we end up with ~$123mn in normalized earnings (($297+$88+$76+$76+$76)/5); implying that shares are trading at 37x normalized earnings.
  I want to emphasize just how conservative these assumptions are. The games we are using as comparisons are award winning games with 90+ scores on Metacritic[1], while Cyberpunk has become a meme with a score of 61. This allowed them to have much longer lives than most games as the developers leveraged the initial success to launch various DLC (downloadable content) and “Game of the Year” editions. Given that Cyberpunk has not been as well-received as these games, it is very possible that volumes (and revenues) will decline at a much greater pace over the next 4 years.

  SUMMARY OVERVIEW
  The payments sector is benefitting from numerous secular tailwinds, including the cash to card conversion, ecommerce growth and consumer adoption of digital financial services, as well as a cyclical recovery of consumer spending from COVID. While the market has generously re-rated many payments/fintech stocks that are on the right side of digital acceleration in 2020 – Square, Stone, Paypal, Adyen and Afterpay, to name a few – PAGS hasn’t benefitted to nearly the same degree.
  Looking forward, I believe the PAGS secular and recovery story is as attractive as the aforementioned list. Specifically, I believe PAGS is well-positioned to see durable 35-40%+ growth in the near-term and 25%+ growth longer-term driven by a) penetration of the micro-merchant base in Brazil driving compounded growth well in excess of GDP, b) continued cash to card conversion and e-commerce penetration from current low levels compared to the rest of the world and c) the growth of PagBank, a digital neobank, which will solidify its merchant acquiring business and accrete value on incremental consumer spending that is currently not reflected in shares.
      INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS / RISKS
  Investment Highligh
1. PAGS is a leading Brazilian fintech player democratizing payment acceptance and digital banking, growing 35%+ with ~25%+ net margins
2. PAGS has continued runway to capture share within the micro-merchant acquiring market where it has a competitive advantage relative to incumbents, driving outsized growth relative to the market
3. Benefitting from structural tailwinds in the Brazilian market, specifically a) low e-commerce penetration (~5% vs 20%+ in US/UK/China), b) low card penetration (~35% vs US mid/high 40s and UK mid 60s), c) adoption of POS systems from micro-merchants (80% of micro-merchants never accepted cards pre-PAGS) and d) a large, unbanked population (~55-60m Brazilians, or ~30% of the population vs 5-10% of the US population)PagBank is a nascent but fast-growing business attacking a large TAM with significant valuation potential (which is currently not appreciated within the stock price) given where other neobank comps have traded,
4. Earnings power masked within the business given a) pandemic headwinds and b) investments into PagBank
      Risks
  1.       Macro / emerging market risk
  a.       Mitigant: The Brazilian economy has been healthy and the Brazilian Real is as weak relative to the USD as its been in the last 20 years
  2.       Regulation – specifically around prepayment of installments, settlement periods and other initiatives around capping MDRs (interchange caps, Pix payments, etc.)
  a.       Mitigant: Discussed in detail below – but we believe these are meaningful risks, but don’t believe anything is imminent (with the caveat that regulatory policy, particularly in EM, is unpredictable). I also believe that the valuation embeds the regulatory risk
  3.       Competition – Stone/Cielo/Rede moving down into the micro-merchant space, NuBank and Pago for PagBank
  a.       Mitigant: For the acquiring business, I believe that PAGS has emerged as a winner in the micro-merchant space in a similar way SQ has in the US. Our view is that Stone is likely to remain focused on its core SMB market, while Cielo/Rede are poor competitors that don’t have the capabilities to compete
  4.       UOL coming to market with secondary
  a.       Mitigant: Came to market last October (~5% of PAGS’s shares), and PAGS likely represents a significant portion of Luis Frias’s wealth
  5.       Governance considerations – Cayman-registered entity
      BUSINESS OVERVIEW
  Succinctly, PAGS is the Brazilian Square. While some nuances which I will describe, there’s a lot of similarities between the two companies.
  PagSeguro was founded in 2006 as a subsidiary of Universo Online (UOL), an internet conglomerate that reaches 90% of the Brazilian population and one of the most trafficked sites behind Facebook and Google. Pagseguro was founded to serve as the payment infrastructure to address the concern around trust and security around ecommerce transactions, in a similar fashion that led to Paypal’s founding within eBay.
      MERCHANT ACQUIRING
  In 2013, PAGS pivoted the business away from being an online wallet and into their core micro-merchant acquiring business that it’s known for today. They sold Square-like mobile-POS devices at significantly lower costs than Cielo and Rede (Cielo/Rede rented their hardware, and the cost for a PAGS device cost about 3-4 months of rental fees of Cielo/Rede).
  It’s important to understand the history of the Brazilian financial sector – up until 2010, the acquiring industry was a duopoly with Cielo and Rede. Cielo was backed by a consortium of banks and was the exclusive acquirer for Visa transactions, while Rede was backed by another consortium of banks and was the exclusive acquirer for Mastercard transactions. In 2010, the Central Bank in an effort to promote more competition, eliminated these exclusive arrangements and opened up the market to more competition. While large enterprises were generally served by Cielo/Rede, there was an opportunity to address the SME and micro-merchant segment, which represented ~50% of the market. The two large acquirers still have significant share at 70% - however have continued to cede share to upstarts PAGS and Stone.
  PAGS immediately focused on the micro-merchant segment (e.g. dentist, barber, landscaper, hot dog vendor, etc.) given its negligence by the larger acquirers. Management has called out 12-13m such merchants, of which PAGS has ~6.7m as customers today. Notably, 80% of these merchants previously did not accept credit cards prior to PAGS. Unlike the larger acquirers and Stone, who focuses on the mid-market, PAGS goes to market largely through an online, self-serve system with frictionless onboarding, with a highly efficient customer acquisition.
  There are two secular tailwinds to consider within the Brazilian market. First, ecommerce still only represents ~5% of total retail sales (vs ~20% in the US, mid-20s in China and high 20s in the UK). ~15% of PAGS TPV is ecommerce, and they have roughly a ~15% market share. They recently acquired Wirecard MOIP to enhance their online business. Secondly, card penetration in Brazil today is 34%, below the US in the mid/high 40s and UK around ~70%. More notably, management has said that ~15% of TPV for their merchants are done via card relative to larger merchants who do as much as 50-70% of their volumes via card, suggesting significant runway to go.
  EARNINGS ALGORITHM
  Top-Down:
  PCE in Brazil should continue to grow MSD coming out of COVID, while card expenditure growth has been growing roughly ~2.5x PCE in the mid-teens as the cash to card shift accelerates by taking 3-5% share each year. Given its lower penetration rates vs other developed markets and COVID as an accelerant, I would expect mid-teens growth in card expenditure within the industry to continue over the next 3-5 years as card penetration levels approach levels seen in developed markets. Notably, this secular tailwind should be stronger in the down market where PAGS operates, where 80% of merchants previously never accepted cards and card penetration amongst their clients is only 15% - this should helps PAGS sustain high 20s to low 30s growth for the next 3-5 years.
Bottoms-Up:
The revenue algo for the acquiring business is relatively straight forward – merchants x TPV per merchant x MDR. PAGS has ~6.7m active merchants on its platform today, and they’ve called out 12-14m micro-merchants in the market. They’ve been adding ~1.5m+ merchants per year, and have reiterated that expectation for 2021. TPV per merchant has been growing L/MSD; however, their card transactions still only represent ~15% of volumes for their merchants, suggesting an opportunity for acceleration, driving high 20s / low 30s TPV growth over the next 3-5 years.
Take rate compression has occurred within Brazil driven by a) competition and b) mix shift as debit outgrows credit. For the acquiring business, I expect take rate compression to continue as competition remains and the industry mixes towards less favorable transaction types (debit and Pix, a new digital payment method that will displace debit with even lower margins), yielding gross and net acquiring revenue growth in the low/mid 20s.
Installment prepayment financial revenues (which have typically yielded ~1.5% of TPV) are layered on top and should grow in-line with TPV more or less, although have regulatory risk (more described below). The consolidated business does low/mid 30s EBITDA margins on a reported basis (however most other payments companies report net not gross revs, so on an apples/apples basis its closer to 42%) – better than the low/mid 20s margins of the US acquirers (pre-M&A). However, if you back out the high margin prepayment revenue, the core acquiring business today is relatively breakeven.
  Cielo’s core acquiring business operates at around ~16% margins, significantly higher than the LSD EBITDA margins that PAGS and STNE’s core acquiring business does. Before the pandemic and investments in PagBank, PAGS’s core acquiring business was doing close to ~8-10%; low double digit margins should be achievable with time, as lower net MDRs should be offset by scale economics.
  ONLINE/ECOMMERCE
E-commerce remains under-penetrated within Brazil at ~5% of total retail sales (vs ~20% in the US, mid-20s in China and high 20s in the UK). Stone has bigger exposure to online/e-commerce – reportedly ~51% market share within e-commerce compared to mid-teens for PAGS. Since the pandemic, both have reported e-commerce TPV growth ~70%+, and both were growing high teens in 1Q pre-pandemic.
Stone (after MELI) remains the more direct way of investing behind the theme of ecommerce penetration given its market share, positioning with SMB merchants and % of TPV that comes from e-commerce; however, PAGS continues to have meaningful share of online/ecommerce and recently acquired Wirecard MOIP to further penetrate its presence within e-commerce and online, which should continue to be a tailwind for the business going forward.
  REGULATION
Additionally, there are two anomalies specific to the Brazilian market. First, installment financing is highly prevalent in many (credit) transactions within Brazil. Secondly, the default is that cash is settled 30 days post-transaction (vs 2-3 days in most other markets).
  This manifests itself in the pricing scheme below – PAGS typically charges higher for prepayment of installment receivables, which generates the bulk of its profitability, as well as for the early settlement of funds to merchants (e.g. 0.75-1.5% for early settlement vs D+30).
Acquiring is a scale business given the thin margins in the industry – credit MDRs (~2.25% are on par with the US (~2.18%), necessitating scale amongst acquirers to offset the fixed costs. However, given the existing duopoly that existed pre-2010, and the Central Bank’s desire to push towards increasing competition within the market, the challenger acquirers (PAGS and Stone) have been able to improve their economics by charging prepayment for installment financing as well as early settlement dates. These financing fees are critical for the challengers to survive and thrive given their relative lack of scale to Cielo and Rede – in 2020, PAGS will do R$2.2bn of financial income and R$2.3bn of EBITDA.
Persistent fears of regulation have clouded the industry on potential legislation that would call for the realignment of settlement days and prevalence of consumer installments to be more aligned with Western standards seen in the US and UK. Such regulatory changes would have profound impacts in the Brazilian financial sector and acquiring business.
30-Day Settlement Periods: The 30-day settlement is a byproduct of the high inflation days in Brazil’s past. The argument for the regulators to bring forward the merchant settlement date to D+2 from D+30 is obvious – merchants would get funds faster and/or pay a lower discount which would in theory be passed onto consumers. The argument against changing the settlement period is similar to that of the Durbin Act in the US – by reducing debit interchange fees for banks, the banks had to raise credit card and interest rates while cutting back on loyalty programs; ultimately, banks pass on the costs that they incur back over to consumers, which has been empirically proven in the US 10 years post the Durbin Agreement.
  A change in the settlement periods would likely have a big impact for the banks and acquirers. The banks would likely see a ~6-7% impact to NI with a change in settlement periods since their current two-day floats (they’re paid by consumers on D+26 and pay acquirers D+28) would become a -25 day float (would have to pay acquirers D+1 and paid by consumers D+26). For the acquirers – they generally charge ~80bps excess on MDRs for D+14 settlement, and ~180bps excess for D+0 settlement. I don’t know how much of credit transactions (which are ~60% of total TPV) is prepaid, however Cielo reports that ~15% of TPV is typically prepaid; Cielo’s merchants are less likely to significantly discount and pre-fund their working capital since they’re much larger (as opposed to PAGS’s customer base).
  There are a few mitigants worth noting:
·         Base MDRs could be raised to offset the losses for the acquirers/issuers
·         The regulators have been slow to push the changes in settlement period for a few reasons:
o   The Central Bank’s objective is to promote competition in the acquiring space (which is still 70% dominated by Cielo/Rede) in order to increase card penetration which is lagging in the world. Changing the settlement period is likely to disproportionately affect PAGS/Stone (25-40% impact to NI vs 10-20% for Cielo/Rede), reducing competition which is a stated objective for the Central Bank
o   Additionally, as seen with banks in the US, the costs incurred by the banks and acquirers are likely to get passed through (to some degree) back over to merchants and consumers (who today benefit from interest-free installment financing)
All this said, it’s quite likely that it’s a matter of when and not if that the settlement period is re-aligned with global standards. It seems less likely it would happen in the near-term, however it’s difficult to ascertain that with any degree of precision – and if that is the case, is a risk that’s priced in to the current multiple.
  Prepayment of installments: As mentioned above, the acquirers generate significant MDRs from the pre-payment of installments. Again, the rationale to move away from installments is somewhat straightforward – the acquirers/issuers discount the prepayment of installments significantly, which disproportionately hits smaller merchants than bigger merchants. That said, unlike the issue with settlement periods, the consumer is a big beneficiary of interest-free installment payments – its prevalence is ubiquitous, and its removal is likely to trigger a short-term recession that hits consumer confidence, a task that no political figure is eager to make.
Again, the prepayment of installments is critical for PAGS and Stone to survive and grow – nearly all of PAGS’s EBITDA can be ascribed by these prepayment revenues. In addition to hurting the consumer, the Central Bank would likely significantly impair the smaller acquirers much more than Cielo/Rede – which would hurt their stated objective of promoting competition within the payments space.
Debit interchange caps: Like the US with the Durbin Agreement, interchange on debit cards has been regulated; in the US, interchange is capped at 65bps for any issuer that has >$10bn assets, while the interchange is capped at 81bps in Brazil.
  PagBank
PagBank is PAGS’s neobank that was launched in May 2019. To understand the rise of neobanks, it’s helpful to understand the rise in the US. Digital banks, known as “neobanks”, have proliferated on the scene over the past 10 years. In the US, neobanks such as Cash App (Square) and Chime have taken off after the Durbin Agreement to serve the needs of the un- and under-banked. The Durbin Agreement as part of Dodd-Frank capped debit interchange that large banks with assets >$10bn can charge with the intention of driving savings for merchants and consumers. The unintended consequence, however, were banks offsetting the lost interchange revenues elsewhere in their business, such as higher credit card fees, lower cash-back/royalty rewards, etc. There has been a massive rise in neobanks since, with >60 in the US, who have looked to focus on the lower-income who traditionally were under-served and/or un-banked. Neobanks, by being mobile/digital-first, and not capped by the 0.65% debit cap imposed by larger banks by the Durbin Agreement, have been able to reinvest into a better experience for customers, including a simpler app, lower fees, better customer experience and better rewards.
  Square has laid out a ~$63bn TAM for Cash App. Cash App initially launched in Oct 2013 as a P2P transfer app similar to Venmo; however, given P2P apps don’t monetize that well (yet), Cash App eventually pivoted into a quasi-neobank and to focus on digital banking for the un- and under-banked. Cash App offers a range of digital banking services – Instant Deposit (charge a fee for instantly depositing funds to bank account), Cash Card (credit card where they charge interchange), Boost rewards (loyalty program), ATM withdrawls, interest income on deposits, savings/checking account, etc.
  Despite launching in 2013, Cash App only had 7m users in 2017. However, given broader digital tailwinds that we’re seeing, as well as Cash App’s shifting focus to digital banking, growth, adoption and engagement has meaningfully accelerated at Square and is arguably the more exciting part of the story. Since 2017, the user base has gone up nearly ~5x and monetization per user has gone up ~3x, leading to revs that are up ~15x over the past 3 years.
Cash App has been a significant driver of Square’s stock price performance this year. For perspective, SQ is a $95bn market cap, which would imply a ~$45bn valuation for Cash App; Cash App reported ~$345m of gross profit in 3Q20, up 212% yoy, or $1.4bn run-rate; if Cash App does ~$2bn in gross profit in 2021, would imply a ~20-22.5x gross profit multiple for Cash App.
The under-served and un-banked population in Brazil is significantly greater than the US, reportedly as high as 50-60m (out of a population of 210m). PAGS launched PagBank in May 2019 since many of their ~6.7m merchants didn’t have a bank account. 18 months later, PagBank has ~7m customers, an impressive accomplishment given the length of time it’s taken Cash App to scale. While the intention of PagBank was to address the banking needs of its (mainly) un-banked merchant base – PagBank has showed early signs of consumer adoption outside of its merchant base. Of the ~6.7m PagBank users, ~1/3 are consumers (that aren’t a PAGS merchant client), or ~2.2m, which roughly doubled in the past quarter itself. To date, PAGS has already gotten ~60% of their merchant base on PagBank.
  Similar to SQ, PagBank has outlined a R$461bn (~$87bn) TAM within payments, ~17x the TAM of its core merchant business. The core products and services of PagBank are similar to Cash App – deposit account, credit card, micro-lending, bill pay, instant deposit, investing, insurance and loyalty rewards. PagBank today tends to be more merchant-focused – their lending products today are catered towards merchants and not consumers, products/services for payroll, etc. However, they will look to expand and cater more towards consumers over the next 12 months. Sellside estimates that ~80% of the revenues for PagBank and Cash App come from spending – interchange on credit transactions, bill pay, instant deposit / wire transfers, etc., and the other 20% from lending (which they keep the capital on their B/S).
  As of 3Q20, they currently monetize its user base around ~$15/yr, while Cash App runs closer to $40. There’s an argument to be made that a Brazil neobank should monetize lower than a US peer (lower per capita income); however, on the flip side, given PAGS’s more merchant-centric focus, there’s an argument to be made that merchants should monetize better than consumers. That said, given the large TAM, and the runway in monetization, I believe PagBank should have room for growth. Management has guided PagBank revs to be ~30% of total by FY24.
  Again, I get confidence in our LT EBIT estimates which appear conservative – if you factor in the financing of receivables (and assume its 100% margin) and that PagBank can ultimately get to 20% contribution margins (vs Cash App being close to ~80% gross profit margins), it implies a ~7% margin for the acquiring business (while Cielo is more than double that at current volumes today). That said, there’s risk to the durability of the financing revenue stream (more discussed below) as well as PagBank execution (also discussed below), so I believe conservatism is appropriate.
While the PagBank/Cash App analogy is easy and obvious to make, the key difference between the two is that Cash App was in the market early with a strong brand name given its P2P roots which gave it a significant advantage. PagBank, meanwhile, is much younger and competes with NuBank, a Brazilian neobank backed by Sequoia/Tiger/DST that was valued at $10bn in 2019 (and likely significantly higher today). NuBank has 25m customers and is already a dominant player within Brazil (and Latam generally) and may limit PagBank’s growth; that said, PagBank has posted very strong early numbers and has shown good signs of product-market fit, and the US market has shown that the market is large enough for multiple winners (e.g. 60 neobanks, Chime and Cash App both succeeding, etc.). At today’s prices, I don’t believe full value is being ascribed to PagBank.
  Stone and Pago Competition
As previously mentioned, in addition to Cielo/Rede (the sleepy incumbents that are losing significant share), PAGS competes with Stone and Pago in the merchant acquiring business (and with NuBank and to a lesser extent Pago with PagBank).
As shown by the numbers below, Stone focuses on a larger customer – more of an SMB customer than a micro-merchant. Their strategy is different from PAGS in that a) the sales cycle and go-to-market generally appears to be more “software-like”, in that they have distributed sales teams (dubbed Hubs) that go out and sell to customers, b) the integration of their payments solutions is operationally more complex (vs PAGS onboarding self-serve), c) because STNE focuses on a larger customer, they tend to have more of an online presence (which is why Stone’s exposure to e-commerce is greater) and d) Stone pursues a strategy similar to Square/Stripe by offering additional software to their merchants after landing the acquiring business. For example, they will typically expand with software around inventory management, payroll disbursement, staffing, etc., and recently bought Linx, a Brazilian software business specializing in retail management. The deal is highly strategy and should help Stone’s strategy in becoming a full end-to-end software provider to its core merchants.
Notably, Stone’s growth strategy has generally been predicated around further capturing wallet share from its SMB base by bundling more software solutions to its merchants rather than moving down-market; however, monitoring Stone’s strategy and any future down-market move is important and could be negative for PAGS in the future. PAGS themselves remains focused on the micro-merchant space (particularly given the white space still available), however seem to be showing signs of moving up-market (acquired Wirecard MOIP, which has a merchant base that resembles Stone’s customer base).
  Stone’s performance since the end of 2019 has significantly deviated from PAGS and is driven by a few reasons. First, Stone has the backing of Berkshire and is generally perceived to have a better management team (PAGS also dealing with perception issues given Oct ’19 negative pre-announce and secondary by UOL). Second, given its larger merchant focus, growth was relatively more resilient than the more sensitive micro-merchant. Third, Stone is more tethered to online/ecommerce growth, so is a relatively bigger net beneficiary than PAGS. Lastly, Stone’s software-centric strategy (e.g. land with payments/acquiring and expand to other software services) really started to gain traction this year, highlighted by their strategic acquisition of Linx (for >$1bn).
Pago is MELI’s payments business, which consists of its e-wallet and mPOS business. Pago leverages the distribution advantage of MELI’s marketplace for its e-wallet and mPOS systems – however they generally tend to have more success with merchants that sell on MELI.
  UOL Relationship
UOL is one of Brazil’s largest digital conglomerates, with ~90% of Brazil’s population accessing its websites (think of it as the Yahoo of Brazil). Luiz Frias is the founder and Chairman of UOL.
As previously mentioned, PAGS was born and has grown within UOL before going public in 2018. The relationship today has very little strategic dependence other than its common ownership. UOL owns ~45% of the economic and 89% of the voting in PAGS, which in turn is controlled by FolhaPar, a vehicle for Luis Frias, the Chairman of PAGS. Also of note is that PAGS Digital, the entity that shareholders invest in, is incorporated in the Cayman Islands so comes with a different set of shareholder protections and governance.
  The chart below highlights the shareholder structure – note the %’s are outdated and at the time of the IPO (UOL owns 45% today).
Additionally, UOL and PAGS have a number of related party transactions, including:
·         Back-office cost-sharing agreements (8% of PAGS’s total expenses)
·         Advertising commitment to UOL at market rates
·         Can lend cash to UOL at market interest rates (no incident of this happening post-ipo)
  Valuation
PAGS has historically been a P/E and has traded in a wide band, anywhere from 20x to 40x forward. PAGS has traded in a wide band for a number of reasons; while the growth opportunity is attractive (as it is for many fintech/payment companies), and the PagBank roadmap is compelling, competition, regulation, execution issues and the presence of UOL (and the concerns of a secondary) have weighed on the stock time to time.
  I think there’s a few ways to look at the valuation of PAGS. First would be to simply look at how it’s traded historically – as mentioned, the stock has traded at a wide range from 20x-40x and is trading towards the highs of its historical range. While useful, I don’t believe looking at historical multiple ranges is necessarily highly informative of valuation given the structural changes created by COVID and the potential of PagBank, which still small but has quite a bit of potential. Lastly, I believe the pandemic and investments into PagBank are masking the true earnings power of the business.
  Stone has significantly re-rated in 2020 for the reasons mentioned above – broad enthusiasm for e-commerce/digital payments and Stone’s software-centric strategy. As mentioned, PAGS to some degree still has lingering concerns around the UOL relationship, and valuation aside Stone is a cleaner story (better management team, more e-commerce exposure, larger software sell-in opportunity, better competitive positioning, etc.).
  Meanwhile, SQ’s valuation and stock price has significantly re-rated not only in 2020 but over the past few years as the merchant acquiring growth has proven to be quite durable (enabled by secular tailwinds, shifts up-market and selling additional software services) as well as the traction and momentum of Cash App, which again based on some estimates is worth roughly half of SQ’s $95bn EV. The SQ playbook has many similarities to PAGS’s strategy – granted with a few, but significant, differences (e.g. Brazil a more competitive market, regulatory risk, NuBank potentially limiting the growth of PagBank, etc.).
  While PAGS has historically been a P/E stock, I believe that valuation framework by itself is limiting of the upside potential that exists as a result of PagBank. Looking at PAGS on a SOTP basis deserves some caution but consideration – caution because nobody looks at valuation this way (particularly because the disclosure isn’t provided to support such a valuation framework), however useful since acquiring, prepayment and PagBank are very different from one another given risks and growth outlook.
I believe 30x EBIT is an appropriately conservative base case valuation for the acquiring business. The US acquirers grow M/HSD and trade near ~18-20x EBIT, while Cielo grows MSD and trades at 14x EBIT. A 30x multiple is a justified premium for an acquiring business that grows high 20s / low 30s, but also embeds conservatism given a) lack of scale vs US acquirers / Cielo, b) EM risk, c) regulatory risk (caps on interchange / settlement periods) and d) competition (e.g. with Stone if they move down-market and MELI).
  The financing business is an attractive business today (grows with TPV and high margin), however likely deserves a discounted valuation given concerns around its long-term sustainability with regulatory risks. For the financing cash flows, I base our valuation on a DCF. Our base case valuation of ~$7.9bn implies that PAGS generates prepayment revenues for 9 years with no terminal value; our upside assumes 11 years, while our downside assumes no terminal value beyond 4 years. Given the importance of prepayment revenues, any sensitivity around the durability of this revenue stream is key to the downside case.
Lastly, the valuation for PagBank requires more art than science. There’s a few ways to look at valuation; the first way is making our estimates, applying a multiple on EBIT and discounting back to 2021. This is admittedly very non-precise given the nascent nature of the business. The second is looking at the valuations of other neobanks globally – the list below highlights that most neobanks have been valued at approximately ~$500-$1500 per customer at the time of their fundraising. Note – the NuBank valuation and estimated customer count is based on their mid-2019 fundraising.
  Our base case essentially assumes a value of ~$750-$1000 per customer, between the valuations of the US neobanks and the European neobanks, but in-line with NuBank. Our view is that PagBank deserves credit for a) its current growth (e.g. user base is currently growing 200%) and b) TAM (the under- and un-banked population of Brazil is greater than developed markets where the banking system is more built out). That said, I try not to get ahead of myself in the valuation given the business is still young today (and thus has execution risk), and the competitive dynamics at play (e.g. NuBank already a market leader with 25m customers). With that said, I think PagBank presents as an interesting upside node where the valuation is reasonable at current levels.
  Overall, I believe PAGS to be a compelling risk/reward. I assume the multiple stabilizes in the mid/high 30s given re-accelerating growth driven by PagBank and upside to estimates which is a reflection of the business returning back to pre-pandemic earnings power (although somewhat offset by deteriorating take rate economics). 
 I do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.
I and/or others I advise do not hold a material investment in the issuer's securities.

Summary Thesis:
  The cruise industry is going through an inflection point.  The growth in cruiseship capacity is declining over the next three years to levels not seen in two decades. Meanwhile, market penetration is rising and customer sourcing is broadening on a global basis. The declining supply, coupled with widening demand should provide pricing power to this oligopolistic industry.   Managements’ attitudes appear to be changing towards a greater focus on generating higher return on capital and strengthening of the balance sheet, which marks a strategy reversal from the last few years. Despite the rise in oil prices, newer energy efficient ships should help the flow of top-line growth to the bottom line.  Lastly, the recent tragic Costa Concordia accident and European economic woes are depressing valuations and outlook, providing an attractive entry for a longer-term investor.  Royal Caribbean, has lesser exposure to Europe, no liabilities related to recent accidents and is enjoying improving relative performance with respect to its key competitor Carnival.  In addition, its attractive valuation and company-specific catalysts offer further risk/reward support to the investment thesis.
  Company Description
  Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL) operates in the cruise vacation industry in North America and internationally. RCL is the second-largest company in the industry, operating global brands that include Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, and Azamara. The company also operates the Pullmantur brand, which is tailored to serve the cruise markets in Spain, Portugal, and Latin America; the CDF Croisières de France brand, which provides a tailored product targeted at the French market; and its joint venture TUI Cruises, which focuses on the German market. Currently, RCL has the largest ships, albeit a smaller fleet than its closest rival Carnival Cruise Lines (CCL). As of the end of 2011, the company has 40 ships with 95,000 available berths, with three additional ships on order in Germany. The company carried 4.9 mm guests in 2011 and generated revenues of $7.5bn. The company was founded in 1968 and is based in Miami, Florida.
  The “Bear” Thesis
  The sell-side analyst community has been, in general, favorably predisposed towards RCL and the cruise industry.  However, during the ‘08-’09 financial crisis, RCL and its peers, were a relatively popular “short” among some buy-side investors for a number of reasons: 1) alleged “ill-advised” strategic focus on growth through acquisitions and new-build capacity with lesser concern for profitability, cash flows and returns; 2) excessive leverage with net debt/EBITDA reaching 7.7x in 2009; 3) spiking oil prices; 4) weak consumer taking fewer vacations; 5) rising geopolitical risks.  This write-up will focus primarily on points 1) and 2) and will provide some hedges for ameliorating the potential impact of factors 3)-5).
  Industry Dynamics – an Inflection Point
  The cruise industry has an attractive structure, relatively high barriers to entry and secular growth characteristics. It is also undergoing an inflection point whereby supply is slowing down to nearly unprecedented levels while the demand base is broadening. The following paragraphs illustrate in further detail these points relying on industry statistics from CruiseMarketWatch.com, RCL company presentations and research analyst reports.
  Favorable Industry Structure: The cruise industry has a fairly oligopolistic structure. The top two players in the industry, CCL with 49% market share, and RCL with 24% market share, control nearly three-quarters of the world-wide passenger capacity. Barriers to entry are high, as substantial capital requirements (a new ship costs in excess of $500mm) and the ownership of well-known, reputable brands are necessary to achieve success.
  Secular Growth Characteristics: The cruise industry is estimated to generate revenues of approximately $33.5 billion in 2012, with 20.3 million annualized passengers carried, a 5.6% increase over 2011. Over the last two decades the industry has grown at a rate of c. 8% and is estimated to continue its expansion at similar levels. Growth strategies have been driven by new mega-ship launches, shorter cruises, more local ports, more destinations and innovative on-board/on-shore activities that match consumer demands.
  Cruising - a Cheaper and more Resilient Form of Tourism: Historically, cruise industry fundamentals have been generally less volatile and more quickly to rebound than those of the lodging and gaming industries due to (1) lodging being skewed to business/convention related travel, and (2) the attractive price/value relationship to land-based vacation/holiday alternatives for the consumer. Cruising offers affordable pricing relative to other forms of tourism as it combines lodging, food, travel and entertainment into an attractive all-inclusive package.  Cruise operators have managed to fill up ships even in the depth of the financial crisis through promotions. Adverse geopolitical events seem to have a bigger impact on cruising demand than economic ones.
  Demand – Low Penetration and Broader Sourcing: The cruise industry is significantly underpenetrated. Here are some statistics – in the US and Canada there are 330mm residents and 11mm annual cruisers i.e. a 3.3% penetration; In Europe – there are 500mm residents and 5mm annual cruisers i.e. a 1.1% penetration. For Latin America and APAC, the penetration rate is even lower, at 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively.  Although these statistics may be somewhat exaggerated as they include all residents rather than potential target audience and also focus on annual cruise passengers versus all-time cruise passengers, the point remains that this is an under-served market.  Cruise companies are focusing on tapping that under-penetrated demand by increasing significantly cruises in areas such as South America, Australia and Asia.  Furthermore, sourcing is going more global – in 2012 the two major players are expecting to originate c. 50% of their guests from outside the US. Five years ago, non-US guests accounted for less than 25%.  Lastly, people in the ages of 55-65 represent one of the largest cruising demographics. Fortunately for the industry, with the aging of the population this customer pool is growing.
  Supply – Lowest Consecutive 3-Year Growth in Two Decades: One of the key points made by the cruise industry’s “bears” is that the industry grew significantly in the past decade through a rapid debt-fueled capacity expansion with minimum respect for ROIC. However, it appears that this behavior is changing.  According to Enskilda Research, the cruise industry’s gross capacity growth is estimated to be 4.3% for 2012, 3.0% for 2013 and 3.8% for 2014. The Costa Concordia ship is very likely to be out of service for at least the entire 2012, which will reduce the capacity growth for 2012 to 3.5%.  Over the last two decades, industry capacity growth has been less than 4% only twice – once in 1994 (3.7%) and once in 2005 (3.0%), however these years were preceded by nearly double-digit increases.  During the balance of the last twenty years, capacity growth has varied between 6% and 12%. Partly due to the financial crisis restricting credit and partly driven by a renewed focus on balance sheet strength and free cash flow generation, the industry leaders have curtailed new orders to an unprecedented low three-consecutive-years growth rate.
  Energy Efficient Ships: Over the last 5-7 years fuel consumption as measured my tonnage/passenger-capacity-day has improved between 10-20% among the major cruise operators.  During that period, however oil prices have increased substantially eroding some of these benefits.
  Royal Caribbean – An Inflection Point?
  Historically, RCL has been the second industry player not only in terms of size but also in terms of operational performance as compared to CCL.  In terms of ROIC, RCL has averaged c. 5% over the last decade while CCL has been closer to 8%.  RCL has experienced, lower net pricing and relatively higher costs, partly due to mix and scale and partly to capital mis-allocation decisions, which has manifested itself in the lower returns.  It appears now that RCL’s relative performance is improving. In order to highlight this progress, we will outline some of the main drivers and sensitivities behind the RCL business model.  Here are some key definitions:
  Selected Cruise Industry Definitions
Available Passenger Capacity Days (APCD) -> the number of available lower berths multiplied by the number of days a ship is in revenue generation service.
Occupancy -> the actual number of passenger cruise days divided by APCD and is based on the assumption of 2 berths per cabin. Some cabins may have drop down bunks and actually hold 3-4 people per cabin, which is why quite often occupancy figures are above 100%.
Net Yield -> cruise revenues less airline revenue, travel agent commissions and expenses related to airline and onboard revenue, all divided by APCD. The yr./yr. change in net yields is the sum of the yr./yr. change in occupancy plus the yr./yr. change in net per diems
Net Cruise Costs (NCC) -> cruise operating and selling and administrative expenses less travel agent commissions, expenses related to airline and onboard revenue, all divided by APCD.
  The main revenue drivers for a cruise operator are ticket prices, on-board revenues, available capacity and occupancy - the higher each of these items is, the higher the revenues.  Of these four metrics, available capacity and occupancy have been the most consistent over the last decade. As indicated earlier, the industry, and RCL in particular, have consistently been adding capacity, albeit at a somewhat varying rate (3-12%, in the case of RCL).  Occupancy at RCL has also been steady, ranging tightly between 103-106%, i.e. ships always sail full.  Net on-board revenues have ranked third in terms of consistency, rising from $39/APCD in 2003 to $52/APCD in 2007 before declining due to the ’08- ’09 recession and the increased proportion of European guests who tend to spend less. 
  The most volatile component amongst the revenue drivers has been net ticket revenues, as the cruise operators use ticket pricing as a lever to fill up available capacity. They have varied between $107/APCD and $132/APCD over the last decade.  Therefore the primary focus of the investment community, as it analyses RCL, is Net Yields, i.e. net revenues per passenger per day.  The sensitivities to the business model to a change in net yields are high. As per the latest company presentation, 1% change in net yield leads to $0.27 EPS change, which is about 13%-15% of EPS based on most current company guidance.
  Historically, CCL has always had higher net yields than RCL (see table 1). Over the last nine years, that difference averaged c. $9 / APCD.  In 2012, RCL will exceed CCL’s net yields for the first time by over $3 /APCD.  This is driven partly by CCL’s Costa Concordia disaster as well as by the fact that Europe comprises a bigger portion of the revenues for Carnival. It is also due to RCL’s launch of some of the most modern and “buzz-generating” Oasis and Solstice Class ships.  Other factors contributing to higher net yields are broader global sourcing, greater diversification, exposure to higher-yielding regions and the recent upgrade of the company’s international distribution system.  Clearly, the favorable supply/demand dynamics discussed earlier will provide further support to the pricing in the industry, benefiting all players.  It is quite likely that net yields will rise over the next three years above recent peaks achieved in 2008 (RCL’s peak net yields were c. $184 vs. the current c. $170).
  In the past, RCL lagged behind CCL not only in terms of revenue yields but also in terms of costs (see table 1). In the cruise industry, the main cost drivers are SG&A, food and fuel. Comparing the two major cruise operators, one can easily notice that net cruise costs were generally higher at RCL over the better part of the last decade.  Between 2003 and 2010, CCL average net cruise costs were c. $5/APCD lower than those of RCL. However, over the last five quarters the trend has started to reverse – in 2011, RCL spent approximately $4/APCD less. The main driver behind the improvement in net cruise costs are reduced SG&A per APCD and utilization of more fuel-efficient, larger ships (on average, RCL’s ships are 18% more fuel efficient as measured by tonnage per APCD).  Furthermore, RCL hedges 50% of its fuel consumption, while CCL does not and that has helped in a rising oil price environment. In terms of sensitivities, 1% change in net cruise expenses (ex fuel) is $0.15 change in EPS and 1% change in fuel prices equals $0.015 change in EPS.

  The table above also shows that in 2012 EBITDA margins are starting to converge between the two players, after being apart c. 6% for most of the decade. Overall it appears that RCL is beginning to close the operational gap between itself and the leader in the industry.  The Costa Concordia disaster, which affected CCL more drastically, is certainly contributing to this relative performance.  However, there are a number of signs pointing that this trend should continue, which will contribute significantly to improved returns and profitability at RCL and hence a higher valuation.  Management of the company has recently stated publicly that it targets double-digit ROIC which is a change in strategy compared to a few years ago.
  From a balance sheet and a cash flow perspective the company is also strengthening.  RCL was overleveraged during the financial crisis with Net Debt / EBITDA reaching c. 7.7x in 2009. The company expects that metric to decline to 4.50-5.00x by year-end and to 3.75x by late 2013/early 2014, which will place it well into the realm of investment grade.  Given the importance of debt financing for an asset-heavy operator, a stronger balance sheet provides greater flexibility and should boost valuation.  In the five-year period between 2006-2011, the company spent heavily on capital expenditures, averaging CapEx/Sales of 33% during that time, or an average of $1.9bn per year. For the next three years (2013-2015) the expectations are for that ratio to be in the range of 10-12% or lower, for an average of $0.9bn per year. Clearly, spending a $1bn less in CapEx/year will result in strong, positive free cash flow and a solid balance sheet.  This is again a turnaround in management behavior from the recent past as RCL generated negative free cash flow for majority of the last five years.
    Recent Quarter Commentary
  In the most recent quarter, the company reported that prior to the Costa Concordia accident booking orders were up +5% on +2% capacity growth and pricing was strong (i.e. net yields were anticipated to be up +4-6%). However, post the accident booking volumes declined with the largest impact anticipated in Q2 and Q3 of 2012.  The trends have started to improve but are not fully stable yet. The company expects net yields to be +1% to +4% for the year, while costs would rise 10-11% for Q2-2012 due to higher marketing (related to the accident as well as global expansion), longer than expected dry docking maintenance and higher fuel costs.  The company sees Q4 and 2013 continuing the strong pre-accident trajectory.  Guidance for 2012 is $1.80 to $2.10 of EPS.
  Valuation
  RCL had a weak 2011 stock performance driven by geo-political disasters - Japanese Tsunami, Arab Spring, rising oil prices, European crisis.  The stock was down nearly 50% during the year. It is still lagging significantly the S&P 500 index over the last twelve months. In addition to depressed technicals, we believe that valuation is also at similarly low levels.
  Our valuation analysis focuses on historical multiples and asset valuations. In general, it appears that in periods of rising net yields, cruise companies receive higher multiples than in declining ones. The current year, 2012, is the third one in a rising yield environment and 2013-2014 should continue the trend, barring some large unforeseen geo-political risks.  RCL became public in 1993, so the following table 2, summarizes the multiples for the two peers since then.

  Since coming public, RCL has traded at an average EV/Berth range of $170K-$243K. According to Enskilda Research, current replacement costs for RCL ships contracted for delivery in 2012-2015 range between $230K- $280K/berth.  Based on the current EV of $14.1bn and 95K berths, current valuation is $143K/berth, significantly below historical pricing.  Furthermore, the company will generate significant free cash flow over the next couple of years further reducing net debt and hence asset valuation. Looking at asset valuation differently, since going public in 1993, RCL has traded at a P/BV of 1.46x and currently it is trading at 0.64x – again a substantial discount.
  Current consensus for 2013 assumes yield growth in the 3-4% range (i.e. roughly in-line with 2012 growth) and costs rising about c.2.5-3% (i.e. a little bit lower than 2012).  Given our positive view of the industry, and the company’s experience prior the accident (net yield growth of +4-6%), we think that such estimates are likely on the conservative side.  Nevertheless, we will use in our analysis current consensus estimates of $2.68 EPS and $1.7bn EBITDA for 2013.  At these estimates, RCL trades, at the current prices of $26.50, at 9.8x 2013 P/E and 8.2x EBITDA, again below historical valuations despite being in a rising net yield environment.  In prior positive yield environments, RCL has reached valuations as high as 23x LTM P/E. Its closest peer, CCL, is trading at 20-30% higher multiples than RCL for 2013. Overall, it appears that RCL is trading at a heavily discounted valuation both on an asset and on multiple basis.  Further deleveraging at constant multiples should provide a boost to equity valuations.  Lastly, assuming an average historical multiple for RCL implies values of $40-45 achieved within a 12-18-months timeframe.

    Investment Risks
  A greater than expected slowing in the U.S./European economies given RCL’s 2012 itinerary capacity exposure of 42% Caribbean, 4% Alaska, and 29% Europe.
Inability to obtain financing at favorable rates and/or a sharp unexpected rise in interest rates, negatively affecting RCL’s variable rate debt or ability to refinance.
Sharp upward spikes in fuel prices negatively impacting operating costs. Heightened risk of war / terrorist actions which could directly (attacks against as hip) or indirectly (attacks elsewhere) discourage travel.
The addition of significant new industry capacity thereby disrupting pricing.
  Hedges
  A long investment in RCL could be hedged either by buying puts on CCL, which is more exposed to potential liabilities from the two recent accidents and has greater exposure to Europe, the weakest region globally at present.  Given the relatively depressed valuation of CCL and our positive view on the industry, put options are recommended rather than outright shorts.  Furthermore, given that personal travel in general is impacted by spiking oil price and economic weakness, a long/short investor could offset some of the cyclical risks associated with an investment in RCL by shorting a basket of hotel/gaming companies which have enjoyed a much stronger stock price recovery and higher valuations.

Summary:
  Campari is the sixth largest branded spirits in the world.  Since its IPO in 2001 the company has a truly enviable history:  Sales, EBITDA and net income have all compounded between 10-12% annually with only one slightly down year in EBITDA and net income.  Though acquisitions have been a key part of the corporate strategy (more below), all have been cash purchases and there has been minimal share creep for options (0.3%/year), so shareholders have almost fully participated in this record.
  I have owned the stock since 2004 and considered writing it up for VIC many times:  It never seemed quite cheap enough and it doesn’t now.  But I am increasingly looking for compounding machines -- stocks that I can own for a very long time and I know that at least some others on this board are as well.  Campari is cheaper than its peers and I think clearly sells at a discount to its business value.
  Recent History:
  The Campari of today is a much different company than that of 2000.  Over 85% of sales then were in Europe and, of that portion, two-thirds were in Italy.  Moreover,  only two of its current leading brands were part of the portfolio and Cinzano had just been acquired in 1999.  (Note:  Campari, an aperitif developed in 1860, is the foundation of the modern company; like Coca-Cola the formula is secret and supposedly only known by one person). The Americas are now the largest geography (35%) and Italy is 24% of sales rather than 58%.  Though very modest exposure to Asia is a weakness relative to companies like Diageo or Pernod-Ricard, Campari now has growing positions in emerging markets like Brazil, Argentina and Russia.  
  Management is focused on both organic growth and external growth.  Long-term, they believe organic growth can approximate 5%.  Sources include strong marketing and support behind strategic international and regional brands, steady growth in key local brands, and increased presence in faster growing emerging markets.  Additionally, acquisitions can leverage existing distribution networks in major markets and bring local brands that can be a basis for new owned distribution in hitherto underpenetrated markets.
    Key Brands:
  Aperol (12% of 2011 sales):  A low-alcohol (11-15%) aperitif acquired in 2003.  This has been a truly amazing success story:   Sales have more than quintupled since its purchase and continued to grow units in double-digits in 2011, even though distribution has largely been in just three markets:  Italy, Germany and Austria.  Key to its success is the Aperol Spritz, a drink made with Aperol, prosecco and club soda, usually garnished with an orange.  (Try it--even if you aren’t enthused by the stock you will have a delicious new drink in your repertoire.)  The company successfully introduced a pre-mixed version in 2011 in Italy and Austria for at home consumption.  From a very small base sales are growing very rapidly in other European markets.  There are two other interesting attributes of the brand:  there is no direct substitute and it requires no aging as opposed to many spirits, which yields very high cash flow.
  Campari (11% of 2011 sales):  Also an aperitif though somewhat higher in alcohol (low 20s), the flagship brand dates from 1860 and still grows, on average, in mid single-digits in value.  Key markets are Italy, Brazil, Germany and France, though US growth has been accelerating around renewed popularity of the Negroni cocktail.  As with Aperol, there is no direct substitute and no aging is required.  A pre-mixed drink, Camparisoda represents an additional 5% of sales:  this is only popular in Italy and sales have trended down slightly of late.
  SKYY (11% of 2011 sales):  An American vodka acquired in 2001, SKYY has been very successful even though sales gains have moderated in recent years.  The US vodka market, which represents 80% of SKYY sales, is extremely competitive.  Flavored vodkas have been growing faster than the market and the SKYY range of Infusions have done well.  Going forward I believe that growth in international markets will be the key to the value of the brand.  SKYY was introduced to Brazil, where the company has placed a lot of resources around the strength of Campari there, and the brand is doing well there.  Whatever multiple one attaches to brands--and acquisition multiples have ranged from 8-20X EBITDA in the industry in recent years--I would put a lower multiple of SKYY than the three other leading corporate brands.
  Wild Turkey (9% of 2011 sales):  Campari acquired this brand family from Pernod-Ricard in 2009 for $575MM, or 12X forward EBITDA.  America is the key market (60%) of sales; Australia and Japan are the other countries of consequence today.  Performance has been quite strong supported by a new look and heavy marketing, including television in the US.  Organic growth in 2011 was 7% for core Wild Turkey (5% of Campari) and 25% for the overall franchise.  American Honey, a bourbon based liqueur, grew 33% last year and comprises 2% of corporate sales and Wild Turkey RTD, a bourbon and cola mix available only in Australia (also 2% of corporate sales), is also growing in double-digits.  Going forward, there is clear potential to introduce Wild Turkey into other strong corporate markets where bourbon is popular (e. g. Germany).  Also, its strong presence in Australia and Japan can serve as a jumping off point for other corporate brands.
  Cinzano (9% of 2011 sales):  This franchise includes both sparkling wines (5%) where strong markets are Germany, US, Italy and Sweden and vermouth (4%), where strong markets are Italy, Russia and Argentina.
  Capital Allocation:
  As can be seen above, Campari has been a very acquisitive company.  To my knowledge, it has never used stock to make an acquisition and, though willing to lever up, has preserved an investment-grade rating, which translates into an effective ceiling of net debt:EBITDA of 3.5:1.  So today Campari has roundly EU600MM of borrowing power.  Though another deal like Wild Turkey would be terrific (iconic brand, fair price, ample scope for heightened marketing support in existing markets and development in new geographies), smaller acquisitions can also be valuable over time.  Here are two examples in the last 24 months:
  Late in 2010, the company bought three brands from William Grant:  Carolans (Irish cream liqueur), Frangelico (hazelnut liqueur), and Irish Mist (whiskey/honey liqueur) for EU129MM, or around 8X EBITDA, accretive in the first year.  Though unlikely to be a game changer, these are solidly profitable niche products with room for more marketing support and geographic expansion.
  In mid-2011, it purchased Sagatiba, an ultra-premium cachaca, for EU18MM plus an earnout for eight years that is a percentage of the brand’s top line.  Cachaca, made from fermented sugarcane juice, is the most popular distilled spirit in Brazil.  As noted above, Brazil is an important market for the company on the back of the Campari brand:  Sagatiba has grown rapidly in recent years and should continue to do so with the stronger distribution and support that Campari will bring to it.
  Ownership:
  The Garavoglia family owns 51% of Campari through a private holding company; its holdings have not changed. Cedar Rock, a successful London-based investment management firm, owns another 10% and my sense is that it is a very long-term shareholder.  Though I have never met any of the family members, I think they are smart enough to have hired and supported a very strong management team and hence are a plus to the thesis.
  Valuation:
  Campari trades at around 11X current EBITDA and slightly over 10X my forecast for 2013 EBITDA. Note that the large public comps (Diageo, Pernod Ricard, Beam and Brown-Forman) are anywhere from 2-4 points higher.  The free cash yield--even given a bulge in capital spending this year and next for a new US bottling plant--should approach 7% next year.  Though I would not imagine Campari will sustain double-digit growth over the next decade, mid-high single-digit growth seems readily attainable, especially considering management’s willingness to spend aggressively (18% of sales) on advertising and promotion, which, of course, is expensed.  So if not compelling, the valuation seems relatively modest for a very powerful branded goods story with very high profitability.

While I usually gravitate away from commodity oriented names, I believe CNX to be an extremely attractive investment at current levels.  CNX Energy Inc. is an integrated coal and natural gas business trading at a significant discount to its SOTP.  Early 2010, CNX announced a major acquisition of Dominion Recourses’ natural gas business for $3.475B.  The transaction was poorly received by market and alienated investors who owned the stock for its attractive coal assets, resulting in over 40% stock underperformance (relative to coal grp) in 2010.  As you fast forward to today, things have changed.  This  acquisition has put CNX in the most desirable shale in the US for natural gas (Marcellus Shale) and provides a free option on a new emerging oil play (Utica Shale).  In less than 18 months, the company sold a 50% interest in these two shale plays for $4.0B, more than they paid for the entire business.  Our analysis supports a valuation in the mid $50s/share, with $30/share for the company’s natural gas business and $24+ for the coal assets.   
  Gas Business:
The company’s gas business is attractive due to its heavy exposure in the Marcellus Shale company (750k acres).  This has been an attractive area of focus for the E&P space due to its low cost position and high returns even in a $4-$5 gas environment (50% + IRRs).  It is for this reason that its public competitors in the Marcellus are up on average 66% YTD (RRC, COG, & EQT).   Additionally, the company has 3.7 Tcfe of proved reserves (2.9T excluding Marcellus) & 200k acres in the Utica Shale (area Aubrey at CHK claims is the next great oilfield in the US). I have approached valuing the gas business in pieces and arrive at an EV of $8.7B (see below).  For the Marcellus & Utica valuations, I am using the recent transactions, present valuing the price/acre and grossing them up to account for the entire acreage.  For the remaining producing assets, I am ascribing a valuation of $1 per proved mcfe (worth noting the company just sold part of these producing assets at $1.75/P1).  While one can argue the merits of approaching valuation in this manner, the consolidated valuation implies roughly $3.00/P1, in line with its direct competitors.  On an acreage basis, this valuation assumes a price/acre for the Marcellus of $7.1k, well below the $10k/acre + we are seeing in the public markets.  I believe this valuation to be appropriate when considering strategic players are willing to pay this kind of valuation in a $4 gas environment & publicly traded comps that suggest the valuation at or above this analysis.

  Utica Shale:
In August of this year, Chesapeake Energy publicly announced that its 1.25 million acres in the Utica Shale could be worth $15-$20 billion dollars.  While the CEO is known to be a very promotional character, any positive developments would clearly be very favorable for CNX.  The company’s remaining 50% interest in the Utica Shale could theoretically be worth an additional $1.2-$1.5B if CHK’s public commentary proves correct.  If proven out, this would translate to an additional $3.25-$4.50/share above our valuation on the stock.  It is also worth noting that Chesapeake has released well results that are supporting of this valuation range.  CNX is one of the only companies with any exposure to this emerging play.
  Coal Business:
CNX’s coal assets are concentrated in Appalachia.  The company produces roughly ~62mm tons/yr of which >80% is tied to the steam coal business (Utility Mkt).  While the company does have some high quality met coal exposure, it is relatively small and viewed as largely upside optionality to the extent the coal mkt improves.  While investors are inherently skeptical about placing a valuation on coal related assets in this kind of economic environment, this bottom-up approach values the business under the assumption of a recessionary environment whereby pricing is set by marginal cost.  It is for this reason that the investment thesis and downside protection is derived from the unique low cost position of its steam coal assets.  Unlike most industries where the cost curve is relatively flat, coal mines in Appalachia operate with very different cost structures.  CNX’s coal assets are by far the most efficient in the industry with cash costs ranging from $40-$45/ton to produce v upwards of $65-$70/ton for much of its competition (~15% of the market operates at this cost structure).  Given demand for steam coal is not as sensitive to economic swings, we believe it is highly probable that pricing for the product will remain at least $65/ton (marginal cost) into 2012 and beyond.  Under this scenario, CNX’s coal business can do upwards of $3.00 in eps valuing the segment at $24/share assuming an 8x multiple (see below)  While this valuation does provide meaningful upside to the current stock price, it does not take into account additional earnings upside if the economy does not go into a recession. For example, the current coal strip price suggests $4.50-$5.00 in eps for the coal business.  It is worth noting that the dilutive nature of the gas business on an eps basis disguises the inherent earnings power of the coal business
Unlike some of the other coal businesses, CNX’s profitability held-up relatively well during the downturn of 2008-2009.  This can be attributed to the unique position within the cost curve of CAPP coal.  The fact is that in an uncertain market, it is very difficult to accurately predict commodity prices on a go forward basis, but if you can build a thesis that rests on a steep cost curve, one can earn an attractive return even under difficult economic environments.  To fact check the valuation, I also looked at the coal assets under a replacement cost based approach.  Using approximately $120/ton for a new long wall build, the replacement cost of the assets would indicate roughly $7.4B.

  Valuation Notes:
It is worth noting that the company is about to close on a couple JV deals, thereby significantly changing the capital structure & FCF profile of the company.  For the purposes of this analysis, I used the EV, capital structure, & acreage ownership pre-JV transactions.  It is relatively easy to adjust the acreage and approach the valuation on a post closing basis, but would require further explaining on the structure of the cap ex commitments of its JV partners.  Clearly the above numbers are rather simplistic in nature, but they do a decent job outlining how to think about a normalized/conservative level of cash flows during various market environments.  On the met coal side, I am assuming roughly $150/ton, roughly the marginal cost in the industry.  While pricing is well above that today ($250/mt), I do not have a strong view as to the sustainability of this pricing L-T.
  Mgt Team:
This management team is acutely focused on shareholder value.  While unlikely in the near term, the opportunity does present itself to split up the two businesses in the future.  While this may sound contradictory to the actions of this team over the past couple years, it is quite clear the market does not fully recognize the significant value in the assets today.  The sell-side analysts are all coal guys and heavily discount the gas business.  They are used to valuing assets on earnings & EBITDA rather than reserves in the ground, and NAVs.  The company has taken some action to try to mark its gas business to market with two recent JVs, but this has failed to result in fixing what it likely a structural issue (two different classes of investors).  We believe such an action would not only prove to unlock shareholder value, but would close a chapter on a very successful series of transactions for this management team.   
Catalyst:
While it is difficult to point to any near term catalyst for the name, there are many potential options for appreciation.  As noted above, the prospective acreage in the Utica Shale could turn out to be significantly more valuable than assumed.  Secondly, Marcellus Shale assets are in high demand given the attractive IRRs and the potential to deploy billions of capital into the space.  There have been numerous transactions in the space including the Chevron/Atlas Energy transaction last year.  While it is impossible to predict any such events, like an opened ended straight draw in poker, there are many potential outcomes that could result in appreciation to CNX.
