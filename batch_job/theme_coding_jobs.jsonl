But since I search for the answer to my question directly with the help of AI, I can often read what it writes, do more detailed research on the research and read in more detail. Chatgbt was not very useful in this regard, but artificial intelligences with access to the internet are very useful in this regard.\n\n- Previously, I used extra tools such as Grammerly for report writing, especially for grammar. Now I can only correct grammar with artificial intelligence. I used this a lot in report writing.\n\n- I find it very useful in creating tables and algorithms on any subject.

I then compared the two paragraphs and edited some of my paragraphs to gather conciseness and remove repeated contents.\nBackground research using a custom RAG tool. I used BingAI to get an understanding of the project and contents, then obtained the sources it provides in each response. The articles that it provided were generally open source, or publicly available, so those were used in my RAG. Then I would review the abstract if it matched the information I needed and inputted it into the RAG. The RAG helped with basic ideation and gave points to think about for the project.\nVBA coding. I used ChatGPT to help code, making a RAG with chemical engineering economics background. I gave up on this RAG as the response time was super slow after too much code was implemented. The general ChatGPT was more efficient and I could feed information via screenshot to simplify my instructions. I prompted ChatGPT to make code and not give code until instructions were fully listed. I also checked that it was doing what I wanted to first before getting code.
