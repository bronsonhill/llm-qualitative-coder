* a time-saving tool to obtain brief overviews on the most critical findings from research/review articles in green hydrogen ironmaking; I collected several research/review articles on the topic of green ironmaking, created GPTs, uploaded the articles, requested retrieval augmented generation from the attached files, and asked GPTs to provide a brief overview of each article and their most important findings.

* an effective tool for getting very specific questions (partially) answered/(almost) unique ideas assessed in a considerably reliable way; After the preliminary research stage, I came up with several very specific questions and wanted to get them answered in a reliable way. Knowing that outputs from the standard use of ChatGPT would not be reliable, I took my time to collect some relevant articles and requested retrieval augmented generation from a separate GPT as per the information in the articles I found. I then asked my specific (mostly technical) questions and got them attempted in a reliable way, which I believe helped me a lot to realize the potential of this tool for my future learning.","* getting my thought process criticized in a constructive way

6,"- I started by asking how I should research. When I am just starting research, the first difficulty I encounter is what and how I should research. Asking this question to the AI, drawing a path for myself and researching accordingly prevents me from wasting a great deal of my time. In this respect, I find AI very useful. And used AI from this view of point so much for this assignment.

- I used AI by asking some specific information directly in the form of whether it is true or not.

- When I do any kind of  research (for example on Google), I open at least ten pages and often only read two. But since I search for the answer to my question directly with the help of AI, I can often read what it writes, do more detailed research on the research and read in more detail. Chatgbt was not very useful in this regard, but artificial intelligences with access to the internet are very useful in this regard.

- Previously, I used extra tools such as Grammerly for report writing, especially for grammar. Now I can only correct grammar with artificial intelligence. I used this a lot in report writing.

- I find it very useful in creating tables and algorithms on any subject. I asked a few times how to create the tables I use in the report with the help of chatgbt.

- I also use ChatGBT's coding skills a lot in my daily life. I haven't used it before for macro excel. It was useful for me to create macro excel code.","* Grammer check

Writing of the report

-In inputted the data I collected, as well as the preliminary writing I did previously in a draft document into chatgpt and ask it to collate my research and create a sample report for me. However, this was insufficient so I kept prompting it to change a few words or include something extra. I f it was lacking I went online to search more articles so that I can get appropriate research material to be inputted into my report.","* Research Guidance: I used ChatGPT to guide my research, to clarify the tasks I had ahead and what else I could research about for deoxygenation, evaporation ponds or new ideas that I have not thought about.

* I prepared a draft of my work and asked ChatGPT to make it more professional as most of my writing was informal in terms of second person not third person writing as my teammates checked while we were doing the final review. I think that is the reason that all of my words look like they are pasted from ChatGPT, Do I get no marks for that? I am so confused.

* Collated the final review.

* Prepared the executive summary, used chatgpt to read through the report, I also had my teammates gather key points that they needed in the summary, and used that to create the exec summary, I also prompted it to change here and there and modified the exec summary as the first draft of the exec summary was not that good.

I then compared the two paragraphs and edited some of my paragraphs to gather conciseness and remove repeated contents.
Background research using a custom RAG tool. I used BingAI to get an understanding of the project and contents, then obtained the sources it provides in each response. The articles that it provided were generally open source, or publicly available, so those were used in my RAG. Then I would review the abstract if it matched the information I needed and inputted it into the RAG. The RAG helped with basic ideation and gave points to think about for the project.
VBA coding. I used ChatGPT to help code, making a RAG with chemical engineering economics background. I gave up on this RAG as the response time was super slow after too much code was implemented. The general ChatGPT was more efficient and I could feed information via screenshot to simplify my instructions. I prompted ChatGPT to make code and not give code until instructions were fully listed.

* ChatGTP was used to help code for the Excel macro for estimating the energy requirement for each of the component. I built up a scenario for ChatGTP, and fed my request to it such as populating block B2 to block M2 with the monthly energy consumption of PEM water electrolyzer.

Otherwise I would ask AI â€œIs this the right way to approach this:â€¦.â€ and it would refine my approach. 

- Writing Assistance - I would write my own paragraphs based on my research and calculations, and programmed my AI assistant to make the paragraphs â€œclear and conciseâ€ whilst keeping any statistical data. Sometime I would specify to frame the rewrite to emphasis a certain conclusion or critical thinking point. 

- Formatting - I would ask AI to reformat chunky paragraphs to a clearer format, which would normally consist of breaking the information into dot points that were easier to digest 

- Typical scaling values for economic values - I would ask what range the sensitivity analysis should be scaled to, and check this against research trends","* Proof reading - especially helpful after long periods of writing/studying when writing became less eloquent. It was helpful to describe your work/thinking in simple language, and have AI convert the same phrase into a more professional tone or cohesive sentence.

28,"Mainly for finding starting points for further research the old fashion way, casting a wide net with a genAI search, and then digging deeper into any ideas that matched with what I was searching for.

In terms of actual report content generation, I only used GenAI in my section on environmental impact of the project. I had a list of about 8-10 dot points containing key points, information, and statistics I had gathered and I used genAI to quickly create a readable paragraph from these dot points. From there a decent amount of editing was undertaken, but it made a positive impact mentally as I didn't have to construct the large paragraph from scratch I was now just polishing and editing an existing paragraph which is a much less mentally intimidating task.

This helped aleviate the feeling of being overwhelmed by the sheer volume of writng that can come with these large reports, thus reducing procrastination and enhancing my personal workflow.","basically as a substitute for google, or used before i google something to narrow down my search criteria.

39,"* Primarily used GenAI for early learning of content related to green steel production and various technologies. 

* When writing the report I asked it occasionally for rephrasing of complex sentences, whereby I usually identified that what I had initially fed it was not clear enough in meaning, so this would help me reconceptualise the sentence.

* I sometimes asked it to suggest financial jargon to me for concepts that I was trying to explain, e.g. eco-labelling premium, premium tolerance/demand elasticity. 

* I can't recall ever copying whole sentences, they were often too verbose, and the effort required to get ChatGPT to refine it was not worth it.","I don't recall copying much word for word.

* Discussed mainly the function of different equipment options with ChatGPT. For example, how colder inlet temperature might benefit a TSA unit, and how the regeneration cycle occurs.

* Clarifying understanding technical jargon, for example, types of solar tracking in the calculation tool (single axis)

* Used ChatGPT to edit VBA code sourced through an online forum, to fix some variable input parameters and simplify the tool.

* Used it as a quick check for unit conversions, but don't really trust it for this","Helped me write the exec summary when I had no time

If I felt like it was lacking, detail was often added through additional instruction provided to the trained chatbot. 

Write-up in general often done with ChatGPT, usually from dot-points. 

 

Unsuccessful attempted uses:
